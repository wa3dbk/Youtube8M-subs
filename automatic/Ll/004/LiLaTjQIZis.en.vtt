narrowest part of the trail and you can

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
narrowest part of the trail and you can
see<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.770> snowmaking<00:00:47.220> equipment<00:00:47.400> on<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239

see there snowmaking equipment on the
other<00:00:48.360> side<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.720> trail<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.860> point<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
other side of the trail this point is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240 
other side of the trail this point is
more<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.360> less<00:00:51.390> straight<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.100> get

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
more or less straight up so they can get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
more or less straight up so they can get
enough<00:00:53.550> snow<00:00:53.820> here<00:00:54.150> without<00:00:54.510> blowing<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.050> all

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
enough snow here without blowing it all

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.299 
enough snow here without blowing it all
into<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> woods<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> usually<00:00:58.110> they<00:00:58.500> still

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
into the woods so usually they still

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.260 
into the woods so usually they still
lose<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.610> know<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> good<00:00:59.880> amount<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> their

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
lose you know a good amount of their

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.520 
lose you know a good amount of their
snow<00:01:00.420> into<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> woods<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.079> doesn't<00:01:01.380> you<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
snow into the woods it doesn't you can

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
snow into the woods it doesn't you can
do<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.130> we<00:01:02.250> end<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.430> having<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.730> make

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
do about it so we end up having to make

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.660 
do about it so we end up having to make
more<00:01:03.570> snow<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.080> actually<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.800> for<00:01:05.520> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
more snow that we actually need for so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
more snow that we actually need for so
much<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.149> goes<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> we're

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
much of it goes in there so we're

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330 
much of it goes in there so we're
basically<00:01:07.979> taking<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:09.380> 300<00:01:10.380> foot<00:01:10.410> long<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.890> 80

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
basically taking a 300 foot long and 80

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
basically taking a 300 foot long and 80
foot<00:01:11.610> wide<00:01:11.790> corner<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> stomping

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
foot wide corner out of the stomping

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910 
foot wide corner out of the stomping
ground<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.660> we'll<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.899> able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.470> all

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ground so that we'll be able to use all

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
ground so that we'll be able to use all
the<00:01:17.130> snow<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.490> making<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the snow we're making and we can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
the snow we're making and we can
actually<00:01:18.780> put<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.590> three<00:01:19.770> jumps<00:01:20.130> next<00:01:20.550> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually put two or three jumps next to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520 
actually put two or three jumps next to
each<00:01:20.759> other<00:01:20.940> instead<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.899> just<00:01:22.050> that<00:01:22.259> one

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
each other instead of just that one

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.139 
each other instead of just that one
while<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.130> hoping<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> make<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.910> every

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
while we're hoping to make it into every

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.060 
while we're hoping to make it into every
Glade<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.539> we<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.899> year<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> at

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
Glade that we have this year and at

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.650 
Glade that we have this year and at
least<00:01:26.190> clean<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> blowdowns<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.539> the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
least clean up all the blowdowns in the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.109 
least clean up all the blowdowns in the
standing<00:01:28.050> dead<00:01:28.200> wood<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:28.860> we've<00:01:29.119> actually

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
standing dead wood which we've actually

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
standing dead wood which we've actually
got<00:01:30.479> got<00:01:31.200> into<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.590> few<00:01:31.830> already<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
got got into quite a few already this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
got got into quite a few already this
year<00:01:33.410> we<00:01:34.410> did<00:01:34.560> boomer<00:01:35.130> Glade<00:01:35.369> Fred's<00:01:36.090> pitch

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
year we did boomer Glade Fred's pitch

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.960 
year we did boomer Glade Fred's pitch
Glade<00:01:36.630> rookie<00:01:37.619> River<00:01:38.959> broccoli<00:01:39.959> garden<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
Glade rookie River broccoli garden and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.400 
Glade rookie River broccoli garden and
the<00:01:41.970> first<00:01:42.179> thing<00:01:42.330> we<00:01:42.420> did<00:01:42.539> was<00:01:42.750> cut<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
the first thing we did was cut that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.499 
the first thing we did was cut that
survey<00:01:43.800> line<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.550> proposed<00:01:44.849> lift<00:01:45.240> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
survey line for the proposed lift so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
survey line for the proposed lift so
they<00:01:45.599> can<00:01:45.750> start<00:01:46.020> figuring<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.039> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
they can start figuring out the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.710 
they can start figuring out the
logistics<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:48.000> begin<00:01:48.209> to<00:01:48.240> engineer

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
logistics of that and begin to engineer

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.669 
logistics of that and begin to engineer
the<00:01:48.810> lift<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.289> you<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.649> how

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
the lift and if you know see how

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.109 
the lift and if you know see how
expensive<00:01:50.099> it's<00:01:50.429> going<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.910> what<00:01:51.000> it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
expensive it's going to be and what it's

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.389 
expensive it's going to be and what it's
going<00:01:51.209> to<00:01:51.270> require<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.319> build<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.220> new

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
going to require to to build it all new

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
going to require to to build it all new

western boundaries of the camp dog Glade
and<00:02:19.010> thin<00:02:19.460> out<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.360> different<00:02:20.630> sections<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.650> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and thin out to different sections of it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.060 
and thin out to different sections of it
um<00:02:22.090> it'll<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.270> more<00:02:23.630> or<00:02:23.780> less<00:02:24.050> like<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> trail

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
um it'll be more or less like a trail

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.980 
um it'll be more or less like a trail
Glade<00:02:25.460> hybrid<00:02:25.970> like<00:02:26.180> nothing<00:02:26.480> will<00:02:26.600> ever<00:02:26.720> send

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
Glade hybrid like nothing will ever send

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.840 
Glade hybrid like nothing will ever send
a<00:02:27.050> groomer<00:02:27.350> down<00:02:27.530> nothing<00:02:28.310> ever<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.520> wide

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
a groomer down nothing ever that wide

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.630 
a groomer down nothing ever that wide
but<00:02:29.240> basically<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.750> nice<00:02:30.140> open<00:02:30.440> trail<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.400> a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
but basically a nice open trail with a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.670 
but basically a nice open trail with a
lot<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.820> big<00:02:32.060> trees<00:02:32.300> on<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:32.990> so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
lot of big trees on it so that the so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.350 
lot of big trees on it so that the so
the<00:02:33.830> glade<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.730> keep<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.120> with<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the glade can can keep up with the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.760 
the glade can can keep up with the
traffic<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.990> already<00:02:36.140> sees<00:02:36.530> because

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
traffic that it already sees because

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.380 
traffic that it already sees because
it's<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.370> happens<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:37.880> where<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.210> know<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
it's it happens now where you know the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.970 
it's it happens now where you know the
first<00:02:38.510> ten<00:02:38.720> people<00:02:38.930> down<00:02:39.200> track<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:39.710> out<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
first ten people down track it out and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.010 
first ten people down track it out and
then<00:02:40.010> it's<00:02:40.190> done<00:02:40.340> until<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> next<00:02:40.910> snow<00:02:41.150> so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
then it's done until the next snow so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.120 
then it's done until the next snow so
hopefully<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:42.560> will<00:02:42.650> make<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.980> lot

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
hopefully that will make it a lot

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.470 
hopefully that will make it a lot
friendlier<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.700> people<00:02:44.000> going<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.330> there

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
friendlier the people going in there

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.900 
friendlier the people going in there
because<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.750> does<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.260> much<00:02:45.440> traffic<00:02:45.910> but

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
because it does see so much traffic but

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.490 
because it does see so much traffic but
don't<00:02:47.090> worry<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.020> said<00:02:48.080> it'll<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
don't worry like I said it'll be on the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.870 
don't worry like I said it'll be on the
eastern<00:02:48.920> boundary<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.490> western

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
boundary of the camp dog blade so the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.740 
boundary of the camp dog blade so the
area<00:02:51.770> we<00:02:51.920> know<00:02:52.040> as<00:02:52.220> taco<00:02:52.490> land<00:02:52.850> should<00:02:53.480> remain

area we know as taco land should remain

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
more or less untouched there will be

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610 
more or less untouched there will be
heavily<00:02:55.610> wooded<00:02:56.030> skiing<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.690> there<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.500> all
