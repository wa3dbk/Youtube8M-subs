00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.450
 three weeks of the grand prix de france 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 of motocross we met 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
 philippe lecomte president of the moto club 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.900
 last to know a little bit about 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 organizing such an event so 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 the last bike club welcomes the big 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.840
 France price counting for the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.539
 motocross world championship the 8 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.099
 and June 9 so 2013 so on the runway 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.660
 last it's true that it's four 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.120
 years we did not have the championship 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 of the world and well that's it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.910
 four years that we work for 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.460
 find this international event 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.600
 and although we finally succeeded and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.800
 the moment all the conditions are 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.149
 together to make it happen 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 possible we are on an organization 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.660
 of 600 volunteers spread across 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 different sectors 600 volunteers who 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.320
 who have been following us for a very long time 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.090
 who we really wanted to offer 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.739
 a world-class organization 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.149
 is the proof of this is that bell and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.730
 600 volunteers we needed were 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.559
 back today so that's it we 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.969
 also allows to reward all 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 volunteers who have followed us for years 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.050
 where we did not have any tests 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.410
 international and 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.410
 m 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.090
 g 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.159
 what so much French pilots are 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.260
 rather at the outposts the gautier 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.360
 paulin so who just won two the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.220
 last two grand prizes and we have a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.220
 little young Parisian agent di tixier 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.509
 who plays the first places 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.229
 since two three grand prizes it is 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.560
 second in the standings 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.869
 in the world mx2 ranking and we have 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.690
 pilots a few young clermont benoît 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.619
 paturel that activate one judges pons the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.909
 spoilsport because it's a runway 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.020
 that they appreciate that they know by 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.729
 heart since it comes regularly 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.259
 so here they want to type a 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.030
 big blow the days of the grand prize of 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.500
 France at ernée and if you do not know 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.789
 what to expect a great motorcycle price 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.789
 cross that's it
