00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.870
 you just have to take it with the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.809
 square let it press a square and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 it will come out as a kind of sound 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.489
 that tells us that you have taken voucher and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.960
 harold well in the third person I put it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.120

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.460
 james pretty much where is it is already 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.790
 I say where the first generator is already 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 you will see it there you have the first generator 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.479
 it's just starting the game you have it 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.820
 at the beginning the second meteorite is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.310
 here in the tower is where he is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.140
 the telescope is golden enteroscope 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.219
 this yellow and you have to look for 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.780
 the bunks 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.549
 down on the ground to avoid the ground 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.460
 see where the second one is 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.420
 we take the same meteorite we give it to 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.890
 the square 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.780
 the square pressed and it will sound with a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.049
 sound that tells us that we have 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.799
 I took it and now I leave it in third 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.829
 person as before you'll see is to remember 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.420
 here you see workshop puts you have to go up 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.549
 the stairs 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.619
 we will find the telescope this 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.909
 golden forehead and then just 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.610
 we have to look below the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.820
 bunk beds until we find the second 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.920
 meteorite is worth a rumor they say 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.360
 that you have to take a meteorite with what 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.369
 which is the new advantage for grimace that 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.739
 I will not explain in another episode but 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.410
 come on I get fuck our three 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.630
 without needing anything and assets with 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.550
 the square and the music has been put on 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.860
 third meteorite is just out of the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.480
 second that is from the second 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.220
 you would have to go out and nothing hand 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.370
 left the first to the left we 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.739
 we will find with this this path of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.810
 wood and we'll find the meteorite 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.700
 between two boxes set this is the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 third meteorite equal we give you with the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.269
 square a sound will sound and start to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.440
 sound the music that now I leave a 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.440
 piece for you to listen to 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.340
 so nothing kids to pinpoint where is 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.200
 this third meteorite is where the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 tower is with the four pillars these 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.950
 folded then out there by the sixth of 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.000
 wood between two wooden boxes also 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.650
 note that the third was there 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.060
