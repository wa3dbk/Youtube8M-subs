the<00:01:07.000> main<00:01:07.240> problem<00:01:07.840> here<00:01:08.049> is<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.979> law

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
the main problem here is that the law

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.510 
the main problem here is that the law
clearly<00:01:09.759> states<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.630> every<00:01:11.619> citizen<00:01:11.979> like

every person born on Italian soil is

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.109 
every person born on Italian soil is
basically<00:01:20.340> Italian<00:01:21.340> law<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.939> doesn't

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
basically Italian law that doesn't

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.550 
basically Italian law that doesn't
permit<00:01:22.539> you<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.720> have<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.229> Italian
