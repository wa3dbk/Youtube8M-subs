medium<00:02:01.610> or<00:02:01.909> longer<00:02:02.299> ranges<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.049> gun<00:02:03.229> can

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
medium or longer ranges but this gun can

medium or longer ranges but this gun can
be<00:02:03.560> extremely<00:02:04.250> effective<00:02:04.880> at<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.450> medium<00:02:05.780> and

be extremely effective at the medium and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.810 
be extremely effective at the medium and
longer<00:02:06.439> ranges<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.100> was<00:02:07.220> actually<00:02:07.610> pretty

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
longer ranges it was actually pretty

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.940 
longer ranges it was actually pretty
surprising<00:02:08.179> as<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.569> tried<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.840> throw<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.439> nade

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
surprising as I tried to throw a nade

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.339 
surprising as I tried to throw a nade
over<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.819> non-existing<00:02:11.420> building<00:02:11.750> anymore<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
over a non-existing building anymore and

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.500 
over a non-existing building anymore and
it<00:02:12.500> bounces<00:02:12.950> back<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:13.970> there<00:02:14.000> is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
it bounces back and that right there is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
it bounces back and that right there is
a<00:02:14.599> pretty<00:02:14.900> quick<00:02:15.110> time<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.530> kill<00:02:15.709> at<00:02:15.890> somebody

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
a pretty quick time to kill at somebody

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
a pretty quick time to kill at somebody
which<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.760> would<00:02:16.909> call<00:02:17.060> medium<00:02:17.540> range<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:18.110> this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
which I would call medium range for this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.110 
which I would call medium range for this
weapon<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.459> more<00:02:19.700> up-close-and-personal

people<00:02:49.790> at<00:02:50.269> longer<00:02:50.540> ranges<00:02:51.019> because<00:02:51.590> except

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
people at longer ranges because except

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.830 
people at longer ranges because except
for<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> l85<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.030> reloads<00:02:53.330> pretty<00:02:53.569> snappy

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
for the l85 the reloads pretty snappy

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.140 
for the l85 the reloads pretty snappy
and<00:02:54.200> those<00:02:54.349> are<00:02:54.500> very<00:02:54.830> good<00:02:55.160> guns<00:02:55.730> compared<00:02:56.090> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and those are very good guns compared to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.589 
and those are very good guns compared to
this<00:02:56.269> that's<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.900> longer<00:02:57.110> ranges<00:02:57.650> but<00:02:58.390> this<00:02:59.390> can

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
this that's a longer ranges but this can

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.410 
this that's a longer ranges but this can
keep<00:02:59.780> up<00:02:59.989> at<00:03:00.620> medium<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.730> reminds<00:03:02.030> me<00:03:02.239> much

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
keep up at medium it reminds me much

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.170 
keep up at medium it reminds me much
like<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.140> battlefield<00:03:03.799> 3<00:03:04.069> AS<00:03:04.459> VAL<00:03:04.760> everybody

knew the AS VAL in battlefield 3 was a

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.250 
knew the AS VAL in battlefield 3 was a
beast<00:03:07.190> up<00:03:07.489> close<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> lot<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.019> people

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
beast up close but a lot of people

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.600 
beast up close but a lot of people
didn't<00:03:09.590> realize<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.099> if<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.340> stood

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
didn't realize that if you stood

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.970 
didn't realize that if you stood
perfectly<00:03:10.880> still<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.540> microburst<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.590> not

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
perfectly still and microburst it not

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.949 
perfectly still and microburst it not

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
strafing a microburst II stood perfectly

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.199 
strafing a microburst II stood perfectly
still<00:03:15.200> as<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> shooter<00:03:15.799> guy<00:03:15.920> threw<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> 10<00:03:16.519> that

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
the gun was dead nuts accurate and would

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.110 
the gun was dead nuts accurate and would
just<00:03:20.120> drop<00:03:20.480> people<00:03:20.930> across<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.769> map

extremely quickly but the AS VAL
is<00:03:25.879> quite<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.360> bit<00:03:26.599> different<00:03:27.049> in<00:03:27.349> battlefield

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.900 
you could see the extremely quick time

to kill at what I would call the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.910 
to kill at what I would call the

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
outskirts of close range and right there

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.300 
outskirts of close range and right there
that's<00:04:49.490> long-range<00:04:50.480> micro<00:04:51.200> bursting<00:04:51.620> Connery

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
that's long-range micro bursting Connery

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.120 
that's long-range micro bursting Connery
recoil<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.060> just<00:04:53.540> melting<00:04:54.080> people<00:04:54.410> you'll<00:04:55.070> be

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
recoil and just melting people you'll be

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.400 
recoil and just melting people you'll be
surprised<00:04:55.730> how<00:04:55.880> quick<00:04:56.420> you<00:04:56.870> drop<00:04:57.140> through

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
surprised how quick you drop through

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.100 
surprised how quick you drop through
your<00:04:57.740> ammo<00:04:58.160> so<00:04:58.880> don't<00:04:59.330> expect<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.810> take<00:04:59.930> on

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
your ammo so don't expect to take on

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.780 
your ammo so don't expect to take on
multiple<00:05:00.470> targets<00:05:01.040> at<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.370> range<00:05:01.610> with

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
multiple targets at that range with

multiple targets at that range with
another<00:05:02.060> assault<00:05:02.360> rifle<00:05:02.660> or<00:05:02.690> carbine<00:05:03.110> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
another assault rifle or carbine I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.930 
another assault rifle or carbine I
probably<00:05:03.740> could<00:05:03.950> have<00:05:03.980> taken<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.340> two<00:05:04.730> guys

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
probably could have taken out two guys

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.850 
probably could have taken out two guys
of<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.270> range<00:05:05.540> very<00:05:05.960> easily<00:05:06.230> and<00:05:06.800> very

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
of that range very easily and very

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.630 
of that range very easily and very
quickly

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
quickly

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.240 
quickly
but<00:05:08.060> with<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.330> FAMAS<00:05:08.660> it's<00:05:09.170> usually<00:05:09.410> one<00:05:10.070> and

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
but with the FAMAS it's usually one and

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.130 
but with the FAMAS it's usually one and
done<00:05:10.430> because<00:05:10.730> you're<00:05:10.910> not<00:05:11.090> only<00:05:11.420> just

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
done because you're not only just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.440 
done because you're not only just
battling<00:05:12.620> horizontal<00:05:13.520> recoil<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:14.060> vertical

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
battling horizontal recoil and vertical

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.980 
battling horizontal recoil and vertical
recoil<00:05:14.570> you're<00:05:15.020> also<00:05:15.610> battling<00:05:16.610> spread<00:05:17.300> which

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
recoil you're also battling spread which

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.080 
recoil you're also battling spread which
can<00:05:18.200> quickly<00:05:18.470> kick<00:05:18.830> up<00:05:19.010> just<00:05:19.310> simply<00:05:19.610> due<00:05:20.030> to

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
can quickly kick up just simply due to

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.640 
can quickly kick up just simply due to
the<00:05:20.180> fact<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.480> this<00:05:20.630> thing<00:05:20.690> rate<00:05:21.110> of<00:05:21.230> fire<00:05:21.410> is

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
the fact that this thing rate of fire is

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.430 
the fact that this thing rate of fire is
ridiculous<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:22.820> much<00:05:23.030> like<00:05:23.240> an<00:05:23.360> LMG<00:05:23.870> much<00:05:24.170> like

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
ridiculous so much like an LMG much like

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.070 
ridiculous so much like an LMG much like
anything<00:05:24.950> try<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.000> stand<00:05:26.420> still<00:05:26.750> while
