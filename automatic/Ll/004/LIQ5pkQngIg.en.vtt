00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.500 
some other reviews on the internet sign
that<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:17.980> been<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.250> bit<00:01:18.430> too<00:01:18.610> easy<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:19.180> the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
that it's been a bit too easy like the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
puzzle a bit too easy but I think this

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.090 
puzzle a bit too easy but I think this
game<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.180> actually<00:01:22.690> pretty<00:01:23.020> good<00:01:23.290> probably

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
game is actually pretty good probably

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.550 
game is actually pretty good probably
promises<00:01:24.850> when<00:01:25.540> we're<00:01:25.720> good<00:01:26.020> probably<00:01:26.350> better

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
promises when we're good probably better

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.210 
promises when we're good probably better
more<00:01:26.890> or<00:01:26.980> less<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.850> two<00:01:28.180> mains<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.630> legend<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
more or less then two mains a legend but

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340 
more or less then two mains a legend but
since<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.820> pumps<00:01:31.479> are<00:01:31.570> downloadable<00:01:32.020> content

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
since the pumps are downloadable content

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.350 
since the pumps are downloadable content
this<00:01:32.770> game<00:01:32.979> would<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.160> expunged<00:01:33.729> probably<00:01:34.330> a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
this game would be expunged probably a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.350 
this game would be expunged probably a
bit<00:01:34.570> more<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.790> graphics<00:01:37.180> are<00:01:37.330> really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
bit more because the graphics are really

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.969 
bit more because the graphics are really
good<00:01:37.720> probably<00:01:38.080> better<00:01:38.260> than<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.500> legend

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
good probably better than you legend

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.010 
good probably better than you legend
some<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.880> gadgets<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.540> some<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.870> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
some of the gadgets and some of the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.560 
some of the gadgets and some of the
combat<00:01:41.979> feels<00:01:42.220> quite<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.610> bit<00:01:42.850> better<00:01:43.030> and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
combat feels quite a bit better and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.350 
combat feels quite a bit better and
tighter<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.729> how<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.030> goes<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:48.360> quantum

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
tighter so see how that goes in quantum

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.359 
tighter so see how that goes in quantum
of<00:01:49.450> solace<00:01:49.600> now<00:01:49.960> as<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.470> can<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:50.590> how<00:01:50.920> open

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
of solace now as you can see how open

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.680 
of solace now as you can see how open
