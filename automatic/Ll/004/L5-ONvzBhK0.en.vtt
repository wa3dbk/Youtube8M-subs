active to two separate surf trips but

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.539 
active to two separate surf trips but
soon<00:03:21.889> it<00:03:22.220> was<00:03:22.310> really<00:03:22.579> inspiring<00:03:22.700> yeah<00:03:24.549> I'd

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
soon it was really inspiring yeah I'd

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.830 
soon it was really inspiring yeah I'd
say<00:03:25.849> that<00:03:26.470> there's<00:03:27.470> benefits<00:03:28.069> to<00:03:28.480> both<00:03:29.480> as<00:03:29.810> far

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
say that there's benefits to both as far

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930 
say that there's benefits to both as far
as<00:03:30.139> your<00:03:30.290> surfing<00:03:30.590> goes<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:31.340> finding<00:03:31.880> a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
as your surfing goes and finding a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.370 
as your surfing goes and finding a
balance<00:03:32.060> because<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.540> may<00:03:32.750> be<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.930> good<00:03:33.169> way<00:03:33.230> to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
balance because it may be a good way to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
balance because it may be a good way to
progress<00:03:33.889> but<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:35.060> easy<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.329> get<00:03:35.510> stuck<00:03:35.780> in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
progress but it's easy to get stuck in

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.839 
progress but it's easy to get stuck in
sort<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.180> really<00:03:38.329> safe<00:03:38.709> like<00:03:39.709> as<00:03:39.950> long<00:03:40.790> as

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
sort of a really safe like as long as

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.270 
sort of a really safe like as long as
you<00:03:41.180> make<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.660> couple<00:03:41.930> heats<00:03:42.169> at<00:03:42.739> each<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.099> bin<00:03:43.250> or

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
you make a couple heats at each a bin or

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.229 
you make a couple heats at each a bin or
whatever<00:03:43.579> you<00:03:43.669> feel<00:03:43.790> good<00:03:43.970> about<00:03:44.030> your

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
whatever you feel good about your

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.240 
whatever you feel good about your
surfing<00:03:44.660> yeah<00:03:45.079> easy<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.560> stuck<00:03:45.769> in<00:03:45.889> that<00:03:46.010> sort

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
surfing yeah easy to stuck in that sort

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.159 
surfing yeah easy to stuck in that sort
of<00:03:46.310> rot<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:47.060> kind<00:03:47.389> of<00:03:47.450> did<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.810> last<00:03:47.989> two

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
of rot and I kind of did the last two

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.199 
of rot and I kind of did the last two
years<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.220> maybe<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.549> new<00:03:49.669> perspective<00:03:49.880> I

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
years and maybe the new perspective I

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.940 
years and maybe the new perspective I
could<00:03:50.329> do<00:03:50.419> the<00:03:50.540> two<00:03:50.660> or<00:03:50.780> differently<00:03:51.109> but<00:03:51.290> I'm

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
could do the two or differently but I'm

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.800 
could do the two or differently but I'm
just<00:03:52.280> really<00:03:52.549> excited<00:03:52.609> about<00:03:52.940> progressing

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
just really excited about progressing

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.250 
just really excited about progressing
and<00:03:53.900> learning<00:03:54.380> me<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:56.660> two<00:03:56.810> surf<00:03:56.989> trips

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and learning me so the two surf trips

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.690 
and learning me so the two surf trips
with<00:03:57.380> John<00:03:57.560> Doe<00:03:57.739> are<00:03:57.919> those<00:03:58.069> search<00:03:58.669> terms

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
with John Doe are those search terms

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.199 
with John Doe are those search terms
with<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.209> kids<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.750> feel<00:03:59.930> like<00:04:00.049> when<00:04:01.180> guys<00:04:02.180> are

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
with the kids I feel like when guys are

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.599 
with the kids I feel like when guys are
19<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:02.840> something<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:03.379> I<00:04:03.440> get<00:04:03.590> their<00:04:03.739> peak<00:04:04.370> of

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
19 or something that I get their peak of

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.390 
19 or something that I get their peak of
I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:06.650> maybe<00:04:06.919> surf<00:04:07.370> based

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
I think maybe surf based

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.179 
I think maybe surf based
you<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.269> better<00:04:09.480> but<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.019> steel<00:04:10.260> ike<00:04:10.500> slowly

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
you get better but in steel ike slowly

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.979 
you get better but in steel ike slowly
like<00:04:11.549> take<00:04:11.909> all<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.180> phrase<00:04:12.390> down<00:04:12.599> into<00:04:12.900> this

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
like take all the phrase down into this

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.780 
like take all the phrase down into this
neat<00:04:13.200> little<00:04:13.230> package<00:04:13.739> yeah<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.549> and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
neat little package yeah you know and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
neat little package yeah you know and
it's<00:04:15.030> really<00:04:15.269> hearing<00:04:15.450> like<00:04:15.659> that

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
it's really hearing like that

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.860 
it's really hearing like that
progression<00:04:16.250> yeah<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:17.850> like<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.239> don't

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
progression yeah like it's like I don't

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.140 
progression yeah like it's like I don't
know<00:04:18.989> it's<00:04:19.109> cool<00:04:19.289> surfing<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:19.680> them<00:04:20.120> yeah

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
since fine you can't even get food to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.980 
since fine you can't even get food to
avoid<00:04:23.639> any<00:04:24.000> gonna<00:04:24.120> plateau<00:04:24.389> a<00:04:24.509> little<00:04:24.810> bit<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
avoid any gonna plateau a little bit and

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.719 
avoid any gonna plateau a little bit and
then<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.139> get<00:04:25.259> go<00:04:25.560> up<00:04:25.770> again<00:04:26.009> is<00:04:26.160> hot

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
whatever 19 rather than as soon as you

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.469 
whatever 19 rather than as soon as you
could<00:04:35.070> guess<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.639> my<00:04:35.759> competitive<00:04:36.240> format

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
could guess and my competitive format

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.090 
could guess and my competitive format
everything<00:04:37.110> kind<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.350> gets<00:04:37.440> bundled<00:04:37.740> into<00:04:38.009> a

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
everything kind of gets bundled into a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.499 
everything kind of gets bundled into a
neat<00:04:38.280> package<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:38.970> prove<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.419> a

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
neat package you can prove that in a

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.570 
neat package you can prove that in a
half<00:04:39.690> an<00:04:39.810> hour<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:42.510> well<00:04:43.470> how<00:04:44.100> does<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.280> feel<00:04:44.520> to
