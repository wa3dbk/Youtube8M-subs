might see some similarities like the
front<00:00:26.460> all<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.490> outputs<00:00:28.029> are<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.210> same

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
front all the outputs are the same

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.179 
front all the outputs are the same
they're<00:00:28.869> back<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.289> outputs<00:00:29.769> are<00:00:29.890> gonna<00:00:30.039> be

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
they're back the outputs are gonna be

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.100 
they're back the outputs are gonna be
the<00:00:30.279> same<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.640> inputs<00:00:31.029> as<00:00:31.150> well<00:00:31.179> so<00:00:31.900> you<00:00:31.990> can

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
the same the inputs as well so you can

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.540 
the same the inputs as well so you can
use<00:00:32.169> it<00:00:32.349> as<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.470> stand<00:00:32.739> alone<00:00:32.800> mixer<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:33.460> a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
use it as a stand alone mixer and a

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.009 
use it as a stand alone mixer and a
controller<00:00:33.970> that's<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.629> that's<00:00:34.750> when<00:00:34.930> it

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
controller that's and that's when it

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.509 
controller that's and that's when it
gets<00:00:35.080> very<00:00:35.379> cool<00:00:35.799> it's<00:00:35.979> a<00:00:36.040> controller<00:00:36.430> for

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
gets very cool it's a controller for

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.969 
gets very cool it's a controller for
tractor<00:00:37.150> this<00:00:37.659> time<00:00:37.839> usually<00:00:38.320> don't<00:00:38.769> okay

the i/o on the back I don't know if we

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.570 
the i/o on the back I don't know if we
can<00:01:14.260> really<00:01:14.410> spin<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.800> around<00:01:14.890> here<00:01:15.310> anything

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
can really spin it around here anything

can really spin it around here anything
but<00:01:15.760> what<00:01:16.390> do<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.480> got<00:01:16.660> we<00:01:16.750> got<00:01:16.900> plenty<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.200> RC<00:01:17.650> a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
but what do we got we got plenty of RC a

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800 
but what do we got we got plenty of RC a
lot<00:01:17.890> of<00:01:18.010> connectivity<00:01:18.400> their<00:01:18.760> inputs<00:01:19.450> for
