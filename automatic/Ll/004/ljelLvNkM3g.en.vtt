00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.609
 it's a match of 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.109
 which concludes 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.499
 a heavy week of training and internship so 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.609
 it must be taken as such that 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.669
 a good thing 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.779
 especially in the second half three individuals elise kongo 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.579
 very good 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.289
 First line 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.729
 he was in phase where you live at a heavy job so that the legs 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.860
 of animation for the children could have done it v I think that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 it's huge thompson 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 like any Frejus team playing ball 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.970
 that's what you always need a very interesting term 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.089
 this city 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.039
 we must adapt to any type of adversary and our strength 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 as in the tales the monte-en-l'air 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.400
 I jump I get my head 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.550
 however, it always feels good 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.710
 to even mark fate in the kiosks 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.390
 for the trust of the attacker 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.180
 perfect for the team account to win a lot 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.660
 during the match of all the most important is 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 we will give ourselves to pass the bank of France 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 what would it be 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.920
 after it is sure of growth is what plans to realize 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 back so to review especially immediately 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 we feel focused on the next match 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.430
 in three years after that of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 enough to occupy 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.790
 I'm happy that the attacked concentrate for all 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.140
 the first goal was still more 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.820
 really doubt 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.870
 to find an opposition to the different treaties of training 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.760
 and at the same time that you go up 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.730
 a team of towers that 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.340
 tactically players pretty much the same way 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 it's true that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.269
 it can give me some benchmarks even if you have to be very measured 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.279
 by these probes 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.259
 especially poet of match especially not the same 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.259
 even hanoune does not always happen 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.929
 very good opponent of 2002 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.079
 which means that 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.319
 more the motivation of the cup it's going to be a match 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.900
 but delicate and florent mentions submit to make it to the idea of ​​playing 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.789
 with a lot more 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.469
 more intensely than what we did today but 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.729
 we are at logic
