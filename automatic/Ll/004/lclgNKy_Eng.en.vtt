00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.990

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.029
 map installed this video is for you 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 very well 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:37.290
 let's start let's go to the page that I left you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.720
 in the description here you can find 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 many things for halo but now only 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.809
 we are interested in maps as we see there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.109
 many maps to download me here 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 I have one previously selected already 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.640
 that we have our preferred map 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.040
 we lower the page a little and click 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.830
 in download 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.810
 will begin to process our download and 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.230
 we have to wait 20 seconds 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.290
 approximately when they pass the download 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.750
 will start automatically once 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.440
 finished the download leaves us a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.500
 rar file 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 to unzip we give it right click 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.550
 and extract here 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.410
 leaves us a series of files but the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.300
 that really serves us is the one that has 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.770
 the name of our map with the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.020

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.950

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.950

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.230

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.600

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.180
