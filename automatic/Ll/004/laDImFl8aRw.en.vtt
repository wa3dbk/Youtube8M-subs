00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.020
 ah 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.080
 like any first-time couple rita and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.150
 lupe velÃ¡zquez from austin texas were 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 overflowing with excitement waiting for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.290
 birth of your baby there was no sign of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 that something abnormal happened in pregnancy 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.700
 we had no notion that something was wrong 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 until the delivery was anticipated 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.710
 they happened quickly and made a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.669
 emergency cesarean section she was standing 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.719
 and the birth happened very fast 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 basically everyone was surprised 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.290
 because I had a lot of skin but it was very 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.540
 little 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.060
 the first weeks with lizzie in the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.130
 hospital were terrifying the weight 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.290
 normal of a newborn is about 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.040
 three kilograms and a half liz and weighed 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.720
 only one kilo and 180 grams when he was born 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.290
 These are some of the clothes that I use 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.840
 and save but this was what he used 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.150
 liz time and was born with pro hero syndrome 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.860
 and of neonatal which means no 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.750
 can produce or store fat 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.700
 body although your breasts are 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.280
 they developed normally because they are 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.580
 mammary glands and if you have never weighed 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.550
 more than 29 kilograms and if it's one of those 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.600
 few people that are known to suffer from this 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.110
 condition have very little muscle mass 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.520
 their limbs are thin and very 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.550
 fine many of these children die to very 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.550
 early age 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.350
 our experience is a little different 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.860
 lizzie is 23 years old now she won 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 that eventuality in fact he and if it's the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 living proof that there are different 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.240
 types of this same syndrome and their genes 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.619
 help find more answers 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.990
 paralysis that means that it is 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.780
 susceptible to infection and already 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 lost the vision of an eye 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.400
 since your body can not store 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.730
 fat if you read if you do not consume at least every 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.580
 20 minutes your energy plummets 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.800
 but paralysis that's just another part of 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.080
 her routine and luckily her younger sister 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.730
 Marina and her sister Kris are always 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.330
 willing to accompany her 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.330
