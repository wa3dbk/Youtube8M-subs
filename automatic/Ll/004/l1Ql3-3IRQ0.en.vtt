00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 I'm good here with line c-50 xl in hands 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.920
 bringing a hands-on to you is not a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.250
 review is a brief zon of what I found 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.529
 in these few hours of use 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.980
 well he got to me about 11 hours from 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.939
 morning is and maybe a little before 10am 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.269
 in the morning 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.010
 It's now 14:15 and I'm from 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.579
 do a review for you 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.420
 the first thing is the size the size is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.790
 everybody talks and we have to talk about it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 for those not used to it is going to be 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 Strange, it's going to be pretty weird. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.640
 others found strange 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.219
 When I caught the show I found 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 very large I found it extremely large and 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.469
 At the beginning, so I started to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.510
 I like it because it's because of this grain and the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 edges are squares so it does not have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 those rounded edges that neither 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.229
 20 for example the most noted balls and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 gives a cooler grip on their balls 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.350
 are square is more boxy yes 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.439
 straight lines then it's strip a little 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.290
 the confusing of the footprint and that with a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.759
 size must be very large is already the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 upset a little 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 then for people who do not like 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.439
 big cell phone this is a big 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 nuisance there is not very recommended because 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.680
 I arrived as not with one but it is one thing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 what do you use 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.229
 but I'm a little used to it now 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.220
 so much so that my 830 that my side use 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.579
 It is he who always appeared from me and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.649
 when I take my 80 so I think 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.250
 small and light because it's big here 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.240
 and heavy then the size for who 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.710
 Dislikes is not recommended and even 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 even for those who like those who are not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.440
 very accustomed will give a little 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.630
 job 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.430
 It's going to be a little strange the second 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.620
 thing I find interesting in it is the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.390
 Battle like I said he came for me 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.900
 is an ace 10 am more or less 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.350
 and he was 55% in battle now 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.330
 four in the afternoon he is 41% 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.100
 Drum this because I've used it a bit 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.270
 without quite low in the middle so 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.840
 this law games there you can see and he 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.940
 spent and 14% battery at 10 AM 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.400
 so far this is no surprise 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.540
 generally manufacturers always have a 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.270
 very good battery 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.710
 i though everyone knows that he 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 would hit very good 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.270
 It was one thing that surprised me to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.610
 His battery is very good, even very good. 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.850
 for those who need a big battery 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.560
 here is a good option for this type of 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.930
 beating person is very good 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.930
 Another personal thing is that he's already coming. 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.970
 with a dn lumen update 2 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:03:00.430
 You can read is and never had a 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.720
 is little parts here and I put subtitles 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.010
 I thought I did not come with this 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.320
 organization so wanted with an interior 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.300
 nor to know of me when I realized then 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.670
 this is basically something that is 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.180
 The boxing day is pretty nasty. 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.390
 because it only comes with charger and a 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.480
 charger is the same that comes from the numbers 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.970
 basic and if I found a mistake an eye 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.110
 very large and old is a charger with 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.780
 Output is 750 meters to the output is too low 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.450
 you with 3,000 billion perez battery 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.880
 for you to carry that little card is 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.760
 it will be very much going to be very time consuming and 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.110
 this is a big mistake it's even more 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.019
 delicious that I realized I have not yet 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.120
 I tested the charger but I know by the 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.250
 explanation, I know it will take a long time 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.370
 to charge the battery of 3 million 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.760
 Well, that was a mistake like that. 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.849
 I did not like it, yes, I could. 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.409
 1.5 player is the teles 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.780
 then that zoom jerk with a 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.909
 battery of this size will take time to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.040
 I 'll talk more, I will not even speak 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.290
 when I put it in the socket to charge 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.870
 I know how long it will take to 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.970
 fall and I found it very beautiful to find more 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.579
 time photo I thought thicker by 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.410
 lack is not so thick if not I do not know 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.329
 exact specifications yes but when 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.780
 I caught him already saw it is not so thick if 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.479
 not then a legal thickness but person 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.940
 normal does not bother 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:33.000
 already the size bothers it is also in the pocket 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.010
 You put it in your pocket and today I agree. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.500
 pants that have a big outline then 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.210
 fell quietly he almost got a 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.090
 little out of his pants with pocket 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.610
 of his pants but he does not have a 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.770
 button here is to give an end but it is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.960
 legal in city footprint was born in 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.210
 hand can be held cool without activating the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.270
 camera which does not happen that we 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.639
 has 330 camera button that cost will fall 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.389
 very safe and new room this is when 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.320
 I see the camera turned on and here's cool to 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.380
 that 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.130
 Another thing I liked is his cap. 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.260
 very difficult to take is and she takes 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.340
 easily underneath and is easy to 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.099
 well, she's not noisy, not an angel. 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.910
 do not stand still device presentation 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.310
 half souza 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.919
 I liked his construction so 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.190
 basically this is the big cell with 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.440
 very good battery it is good dual chip 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.389
 His screen is a beautiful good material very 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.090
 good is not a show stele 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.490
 930 command for example but it is a screen is 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.530
 very good and by size one thing that 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.510
 I wondered is the size of the icons 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.760
 I found it very big here and I found it 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.740
 very large letters because of the 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.139
 screen size as I said long ago 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.470
 time I use a manufacturer 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:53.250
 So you can see I found it a little 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.590
 strange the size of things here but 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.780
 over time the staff will become accustomed 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.080
 so the staff basically was just that 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.940
 here was a brief overview of the 640 xl is a 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.360
 Great device. I liked it. 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.310
 I bought him 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.620
 I was not sure if I would stay but I'm 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.569
 wanting to stay with him like I use is a 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.539
 big beach a very good battery eu 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.889
 I will use it this weekend start 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.280

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.650
