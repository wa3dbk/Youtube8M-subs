00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.730
 third video of the hurry 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.170
 Today I show you how to do such a thing 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 that's what beautiful pennant chains can be 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 do not know who are all needed 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.960
 maybe a few leftovers 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.500
 a little bit of five stagger the caption 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 I wanted to write I have two here 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.609
 meters good that you can do yourself 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.140
 or just bought in the fabric because of me 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.450
 Of course, a sewing machine fits this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 an iron scissors ideal 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.270
 Needle pad what you need to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 life needs just for the pennant chain 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.030
 I have such a template with me 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 a triangle makes it 17 here 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 centimeters from the ground surface and also 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.539
 the height is a 17 centimeters and then 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 I just have one at the same time 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.680
 made of it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.620
 then i have no idea of this case 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 So from material couples cut that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 We will have a pennant so soon 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.060
 then afterwards together and depending on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.439
 if you just want everything 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.700
 or with colorful colors I have myself 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.470
 decided here for colorful colors 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.400
 with you so many pieces of it times 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:23.210
 240 wants to have therefore 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:27.390
 that's why I have here now 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 7 8 diapers made what I'm after 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 language is such a scare 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 I still have that to do one can 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.909
 you have to make me felt out of it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.979
 many little letters and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.590
 cut out out of shape 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.250
 so now I have thought in which 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.780
 order I want the pennants 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 And where do these letters come from ? 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.930
 also a bit and is racing and rich 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.549
 Now do not just write the letters 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.619
 the respective double fixed nicely in the middle 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 we had to go after energy 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 subtract 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.450
 that means I 'm going here and now 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.909
 zigzag through getting into the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.789
 letters disenchanted and then go 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.430
 round again I which is equivalent to 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.040
 is that I am the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.210
 after that ever when the letter hit 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.250
 is right on Rechtspfleger so that is 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.620
 now the left side outside and then 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
 here and here long so me to the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.830
 two longer sides at the top 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.930
 not but I can do it afterwards 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.780
 turn and I'm now only times 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.830
 approach 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.200
 I've got a zigzag now 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.970
 set which is relatively close and 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.110
 So then a little bit the scenario 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 a little further back and forth 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.260
 but in succession 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 that is well fixed then 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 beautifully 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.230
 Now I put the pennants with the two 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:24.909
 good sides and close once 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:36.069
 Along the long side the corner 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:47.829
 but until just before the corner in the 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:53.260
 I knew everyone else now 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:56.849
 I cut off the tip here after 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.849
 cut off a bit sharply up here 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.540
 I can turn this around 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.560
 so and so is my first cheering is 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.510
 I'll finish it if I'm cute 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.669
 and I do that now with everyone 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.370
 other means for me now all have 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.490
 Stitches sewn each in my own 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.790
 letters sewn on and the triangles 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.520
 sewn together and turned over something like that 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.010
 before and I turned around and me 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.470
 just ironed it now too 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.630
 beautiful plates are and what I like 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.300
 Next I make that diagonally 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.729
 on the subject and at the beginning how to think 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.160
 much how much space you have at the beginning 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:50.139
 Namely wants to consolidate the terrain 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.139
 maybe 30 centimeters first heart 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.130
 exactly in the kink 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.810
 I can me firmly by your side 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.990
 I'm doing now with everything so here 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.140
 that is quite good for such a document 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.370
 which has the centimeters of information 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.900
 I can now see exactly that I 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.070
 always the same distance in 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:55.060
 my case is here now 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:58.300
 2 cm so I have now all simple 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.160
 assumption pinned in a row what I did 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.190
 Now I 'm starting here 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.730
 at the very beginning to fold that too 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.220
 the middle and now sew down here 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.100
 edge not too close so also not 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.570
 with yourself but in between then here 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.610
 i have to look that i have the back 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.280
 just not too far to catch so 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.660
 down and then close here just busy 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.610
 long time to the end 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.930
 I also go my normal grad 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.950
 you could actually also in the dash 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.330
 paths I am used to apply the 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.920
 Of course then probably one 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.490
 a little bit more but that is actually 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.820
 also very pretty so I'm going here now 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.820
 the middle 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.040
 Check if I meet the back well 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.840
 and it is quite good if I can 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.840
 stay away from the edge at the distance 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.640
 so i could have my look now 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.560
 I have to cut the ends 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:37.130
 that means I look here that the same 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:39.050
 are long and now is your pennant chain 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.180
 That's how it looks 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.560
 I hope it was a lot of fun and 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.400
 you have a lot of fun read at 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.440
 I like to write in the comments 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.750
 if something can do better or 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.730
 vehicle still unclear has that 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.380
 can explain better likes to do it 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.760
 I like myself better and I am happy 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.880
 of course if you're down on mine 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.070
 facebook link clicks and me easily or 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.850
 times together wanderschaft club comes 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:04.180
 or muffin deadline or on twitter like 

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.180
 you want
