 lg g2 mini 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.700
 here is a quad core on 1 2 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 gigahertz 1 gigabyte of RAM 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 and 8 native mode support 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 dual-sim 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.650
 design in the style of the original version 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.779
 smartphone and many other features 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850
 let's see how successful 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 get a model and whether it is enough 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 potential to justify your price tag 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 if you are familiar with the design of smartphones 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.420
 ruler lg or style appearance g2 mini 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 you will look like this tube 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 series 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 recognizable tight plastic with grooved 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.820
 the saw panel is rather thin body 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.860
 familiar perimeter edging word 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.539
 all those things that can be found in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 models a stylish lineup of this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.370
 South Korean manufacturer along with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 topics familiar to us from the original review 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.110
 version of the flagship button layout on 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.059
 rear panel tells this brainchild 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.489
 created in the footsteps of popularity already 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 famous twos dominant 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.840
 case material is plastic 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 quite a bit of metal only a few 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.950
 inserts and edging functional 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
 elements but what material 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.700
 I hide behind the display frankly 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.130
 saying find out failed 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 nevertheless the classic test on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 practice was not enough for 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.000
 to leave a mark here that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 certainly not bad 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.869
 oleophobic coating is not here and because 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 wipe your fingerprints and oily 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.369
 divorces will have a little longer and with effort 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 in hand the tube sits perfectly 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 ergonomics even considering 4 7 inch 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.479
 the display on board is great to reach out to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 any touch or hardware button 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 the user can not without problems 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 looking at what this smartphone got 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.610
 removable battery cover 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.100
 say that she is either loosening 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 the body can not all the elements among themselves 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.439
 fitted perfectly and fastening the cap 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.229
 on the body fast and reliable play 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.880
 results can not be traced front panel 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 the smartphone is divided between the display 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 slit conversational dynamics eye 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.030
 front camera 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 as well as the proximity sensor four 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.340
 touch buttons last rendered 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.170
 on the display part in the body of the tammy panel 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 implemented the output of the eye of the main camera 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.599
 8 megapixels and LED 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.879
 flash and key block consisting of 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.030
 rocker volume control in 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.290
 the center of which is the power button visually 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 it seems that all these elements 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.370
 metal however in 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.260
 Actually it is only artfully makeup 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.569
 plastic on the right and left 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.120
 side faces of functional elements 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.530
 not provided examining the top 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.959
 butt user will meet here 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.170
 classic audio jack and peephole 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.730
 and comfort and noise reduction microphone 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 the bottom end got two identical ones 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.489
 style output covered with nets as well 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.440
 port microusb behind the pin located 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.739
 left backwards built-in microphone 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.989
 well behind the right speaker phone 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.730
 smartphone got 4 7 inch display with 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.209
 not the most interesting even considering 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 price tag resolution of 540 by 960 points 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.769
 however in practice a strip of seventy 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.019
 four pixels vertically select 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.930
 made on the display part of the touch 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.700
 buttons at the base of the display ips matrix with 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.430
 good viewing angles both vertically 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.140
 so and horizontal while working in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.180
 conditions hit on the bright panel 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.459
 sunlight user is unlikely 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.659
 will be able to get away from significant extinction 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.909
 data displayed 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.430
 however the maximum backlight level in 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.080
 most cases will relieve the user 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.269
 against the need to cover the panels 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.970
 hand or run around looking for a spot 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.610
 darker backlight is adjustable only 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.950
 manually unlike the original version 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.440
 the flagship in which was present 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.440
 subclause responsible for automatic 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.959
 brightness adjustment in lg g2 mini it 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.569
 replaced by submenu brightness at night 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.220
 automatically illuminated 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.099
 set brightness to zero percent 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.959
 at night otherwise 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.260
 display settings are similar to those that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.569
 we saw in the smartphone lg g2 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.349
 sensitivity does not cause claims 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.140
 touch control supported 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.569
 by 8 fingers at the same time 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.370
 Of the officially announced 8 gigabytes 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.110
 built-in memory in practice 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.069
 slightly less user access 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.439
 half 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.049
 expansion possible with maps 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.120
 micro sd memory up to 32 gigabytes 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.919
 inclusive 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.449
 hot swap is supported 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.470
 the ability to connect a usb drive 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.670
 vg-2 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.750
 mini no removable battery capacity 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.850
 2440 milliampere hours 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.860
 according to the official data of one 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.840
 100% battery charge 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.020
 enough for 22 hours in mode 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.390
 conversations either up to 790 8 hours in 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.370
 standby mode in practice when 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.800
 fairly intensive use of a 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.380
 just up to two hours of talk at least 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.780
 4 hours of music per hour on web surfing 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.450
 email and about the same 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 the photo and video allowed the system 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.710
 work autonomously two full 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.810
 working day was not here and without 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.000
 your power saving setting 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.220
 which user can use 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.650
 limit power consumption by turning off 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.080
 unnecessary wireless modules interfaces 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.160
 limiting the backlight level of the display and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.130
 much more 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.740
 two separate internal or 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.870
 conversational and also speakerphone nothing 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.000
 per se unusual not for the first not 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.750
 for the second I did not notice the communication 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.890
 by lg g2 mini quite comfortable 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.360
 speaker power 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.250
 slightly higher than average 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.440
 although as for me it is enough for 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.710
 watching videos in a room setting 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.240
 either listening to music and volume 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.030
 incoming call on the street is also scary 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.500
 not bad in the user settings 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.260
 can adjust the volume 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.110
 force vibration activate them cut out and 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.050
 other g2 mini got an operating 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.700
 android 4 4 2 system out of the box on top 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.910
 which is installed one of the last 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.080
 versions of the brand optimus yuan in front of you 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.220
 test results 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.440
 performance 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.290
 hardware inside 4 core qualcomm 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.500
 snapdragon 400 which clock frequency 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.080
 1 2 gigahertz besides on board 1 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.479
 gigabytes of RAM and graphics 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.669
 adreno 305 add only what 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.680
 iron available here 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.169
 enough for demanding 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.840
 games like real racing 3 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.470
 so play go or full hd 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.600
 video 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.520
 similar to the original model in 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.590
 non flagship version also implemented 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.480
 submenu gestures with which 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.570
 user can control this or 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.030
 There are other functions of the smartphone and a submenu 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.140
 one-handed operation 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.690
 the expediency of which frankly 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.330
 saying i see no need to mind 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.400
 without that good ergonomics among 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.920
 things that also pumped in here from 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.490
 flagship features smart screen and smart 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.380
 video 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.900
 possibility to choose a combination 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.570
 front touch buttons and settings 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.590
 background activation effect off the screen 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.540
 And so on 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.970
 work in the mode of two sim cards 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.620
 implemented quite conveniently at the bottom 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.510
 part of the screen equipped button 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.090
 transferring to the sim control menu 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.700
 profiles where all settings are intuitive 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.800
 simple and clear and the main features 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.870
 8 megapixel cameras seemed to me 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.270
 quite good supported 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.640
 autofocus for shooting and full hd 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.400
 There is a considerable amount of video recording 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.410
 shooting mode settings as a result of 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.630
 good light conditions user 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.420
 get quite decent photo quality and 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.010
 video material with test content you 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.060
 can read in our text 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:29.370
 review on the portal smartphone yuri 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.770
 lg g2 mini pretty curious but together 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.880
 so disputed product on face desire 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.770
 play on features 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.500
 proven in the original 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.270
 version of the flagship but adding to them quite 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.520
 adequate iron manufacturer 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.810
 somehow forgot such trifles as yusbi 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.360
 about the same pairing 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.940
 And the screen resolution even for the mini version 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.960
 flagship seems poor as a result to 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.330
 get sales 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.490
 will need to play muscles around 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.470
 price tag downward but a 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.580
 how interesting the game will be 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.580
 of course, only time
