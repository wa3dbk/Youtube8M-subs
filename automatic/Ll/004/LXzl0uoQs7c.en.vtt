00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 Greetings from the modest flavors 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.560
 we will share a sweet recipe that is quite easy to make in this section 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.040
 "Pineapple Dessert in a glass" 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.040
 but if you want to learn the materials first 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.120
 then we go together to build 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.960
 1 fresh pineapple 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 8-10 pieces of hazelnut biscuits 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920
 1.5 cup cold milk 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 1 tea cup with powdered sugar 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 1 sachet powder whipped cream 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 2 eggs 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.240
 and 1 piece of lemon zest 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
 yes we have seen the material list 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600
 the whole conch had a pineapple 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 we may not always be able to recapitulate it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.080
 let's try to rob him in our house as much as we can. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.240
 we keep our pineapple from the leafy part ... 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 it is actually not a very hard fruit 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.200
 we cut from the beginning 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 just like melon cuts watermelon 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 again in the middle ... 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 soft as you can see 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.120
 when we saw the round part of the canned ... 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.600
 That's the hard part, that's how we get him out. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.480
 again 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 and peel this way 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.720
 we need small grains for our sweet 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.160
 let's show for her 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160
 Let's continue to peel after the other parts 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.440
 now we're grating lemon to stop the smell 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.960
 and not to be too dark, not to circulate some lemon juice 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.800
 let's stop 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.480
 As we said a little water ... 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480
 and mix 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.400
 then we get two troughs 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.280
 the white one of the eggs ... 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 we will add yellow to the other 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 no yellowish yellow 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.440
 we are now flapping the egg white until it becomes snow 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.040
 How do we know that it is? 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.480
 See when we turn upside down 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 the same rule applies to whipped cream 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.840
 There is no problem with the influx of yolk to the yolk of the egg 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.560
 now we add sugar on the yellow 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.560
 and 3-4 minutes of flapping 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520
 egg yolk 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.160
 they are washing their feet just before going to the cream building site 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.680
 Now it's time to whip the cream job site 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.960
 add the cold milk on the powder cream shunt 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.640
 we'll beat it until it's snow 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.920
 whipped cream also, let's do our test 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.800
 yeah it's time to meet now 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.440
 we leave the pineapple grains on the egg yolks 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.640
 You know, we mixed it with lemon juice and lemon zest 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.280
 Let's have a bottom-up like this 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.400
 now we leave some of the biscuits we broke 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 the rest will do the ornament on top 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.560
 adding cream site 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.520
 If you are paying attention, we will add the latest influx of eggs 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.520
 because he should not be too involved 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.240
 we're mixing up to the top 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.920
 finally we leave our eggs 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.120
 without too much mixing ... 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.440
 we are adding only to the bottom-top 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.520
 now we are taking our cup that gives our sweet name ... 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.440
 and fill 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.680
 there may also be ice-cream containers, such as feet with containers 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.000
 what is in our house 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Let's put it abundantly 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.440
 some biscuit crumbs on the ... 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.040
 and service 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.040
 Modest Flavors in our kitchen in this section ... 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.520
 The view was quite stylish, the flavor ... 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.280
 we shared a very varied dessert recipe 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.680
 "Pineapple Dessert in Glass" 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.120
 As soon as you try ... 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.920
 and I know you will remember the humble flavors 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.760
 goodbye...
