exactly<00:02:13.590> how<00:02:13.740> does<00:02:13.800> those<00:02:14.069> organism<00:02:14.790> type

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
exactly how does those organism type

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.720 
exactly how does those organism type
tegus<00:02:15.900> work<00:02:16.380> how<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
tegus work how do they get into the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.270 
tegus work how do they get into the
human<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.180> mean<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.569> he<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.470> me<00:02:19.680> tangu<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
human I mean if he is like me tangu and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.760 
human I mean if he is like me tangu and
let's<00:02:20.489> say<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:20.880> instance<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.140> tegu

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
let's say for instance like the tegu

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.350 
let's say for instance like the tegu
didn't<00:02:23.010> go<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> his<00:02:23.340> body<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.730> he<00:02:23.940> wasn't<00:02:24.120> born

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
didn't go to his body and he wasn't born

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.540 
didn't go to his body and he wasn't born
a<00:02:24.420> regular<00:02:24.660> human<00:02:25.020> well<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.430> mean

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
a regular human well that would mean

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
a regular human well that would mean
he's<00:02:26.760> been<00:02:26.910> living<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> very<00:02:27.720> long<00:02:28.080> time

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
he's been living for a very long time

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.590 
he's been living for a very long time
he's<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> very<00:02:29.280> old<00:02:29.520> tagu<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.120> been<00:02:30.270> living

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
he's a very old tagu that's been living

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.990 
he's a very old tagu that's been living
for<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> very<00:02:31.170> long<00:02:31.500> time<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.489> technically

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
for a very long time and so technically

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.870 
for a very long time and so technically
no<00:02:33.360> one<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.900> control<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.920> tagging<00:02:35.459> no<00:02:35.670> one

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
no one can control that tagging no one

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
no one can control that tagging no one
can<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.239> all<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.720> all<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> him<00:02:37.380> what<00:02:37.530> he

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
can at all it's all up to him what he

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
can at all it's all up to him what he
wants<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.950> do<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.310> instance<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.970> can't<00:02:39.180> just

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
wants to do for instance you can't just

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.059 
wants to do for instance you can't just
have<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> random<00:02:39.690> person<00:02:40.170> pick<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.650> tag<00:02:40.950> go

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
have a random person pick up that tag go

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.770 
have a random person pick up that tag go
and<00:02:41.220> say<00:02:41.280> oh<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.610> mine<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.060> because<00:02:42.599> if<00:02:42.690> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and say oh it's mine now because if it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
and say oh it's mine now because if it
works<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> organism<00:02:43.920> tegu<00:02:44.370> is

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
works like that if the organism tegu is

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.000 
works like that if the organism tegu is
actually<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> human<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.590> something

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
actually a human and not like something

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.670 
actually a human and not like something
else<00:02:47.220> entirely<00:02:47.819> then<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.870> only<00:02:49.050> way<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.410> get

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
else entirely then the only way to get

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
else entirely then the only way to get
rid<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.489> by<00:02:50.730> killing<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.390> take<00:02:51.540> or

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
rid of that is by killing to take or

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.500 
rid of that is by killing to take or
destroying<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> tape<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.209> yeah<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> big

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
destroying the tape so yeah a big

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.150 
destroying the tape so yeah a big
question<00:02:54.870> right<00:02:54.959> there<00:02:55.140> now<00:02:55.319> overall<00:02:55.799> though

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
question right there now overall though

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.479
