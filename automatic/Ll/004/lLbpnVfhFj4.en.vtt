00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello how about how are you guys today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.830
 we come with the song chocolate flavor 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.230
 of elephant this song we are going to divide 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.230
 in two parts d in the arpeggio of the beginning 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 and in itself the strum that is going to be one 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 for the whole song, we're just going to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.670
 vary the chords a bit so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.670
 let us begin 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.900
 Now let's start with the intro of the 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.330
 song I've seen other videos where 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.330
 the intro does it more or less like this is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.129
 is a correct way is a way 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 good to do it to accompany you with 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:03.260
 based on the breath but the way in which 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 touches elephant is like that and that's where the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.280
 electric guitar and the company 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.280
 then watching the second 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.080
 it is an explanation commanded to do this 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.080
 let's use the ropes in this 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 546 nothing we are going to do this we are going to 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:32.080
 give a blow to the air on the rope 5 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:35.080
 so contrast 3 to air to air 3 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 A) Yes 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:49.880
 and now faster and that we're going to do 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.880
 also agreement number 4 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.250
 the same on string number 6 and for the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.470
 end of the fund intro make a 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.450
 descendant of fret 5 to fret 2 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.450
 giving him two strokes on each fret 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.160
 gathering all saying how quickly 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 casey 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.080
 and that's all about the intro 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.069
 as we saw then the chords are the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.270
 less 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.570
 re minor 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.570
 7 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.620
 the position of my major nothing else we are going to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.170
 take away the number 37 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.090
 the mind 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.280
 there's going to be a part of the song where 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.330
 they will enter the chords of the major and 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.620
 the greater sun 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.330
 I have to do this 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.760
 Now what I want you to understand is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.799
 how to make the strum of this song is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.849
 it's going to look a lot like the radius of the 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.849
 Song overnight 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 is going to be the next we are going to 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.980
 locate the position of the minor and we will 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.980
 do this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.150
 this strum also we are going to give you a 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.960
 hit down and another down 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.140
 but already removing it with the palm well 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.140
 yes 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 and we take it down 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.489
 as we explained it from the beginning 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.489
 first the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.030
 Y 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.360
 the important thing about this song is that it 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.400
 learn the strum because the strum 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.170
 to be the essential feature of all 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.970
 the song 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.639
 then then I will make a 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.620
 cover a small a small part quote 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.889
 of the song with you know youtube 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.350
 charges rights for the songs and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.050
 if you do not pay them, they take the video 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.810
 even the channel so let's play 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.090
 a part besides the song there 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.350
 it is so that they realize where 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.220
 he used the funk and the sun and then 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.220
 we go 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.300
