00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.649
 Hello dear friends with you Nikita 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.190
 and in this video I will talk about the game below 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.429
 revenge you see the boot screen which 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.610
 we appear at the start of the game where 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.670
 You can scroll through all the applications from these 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 developers immediately have a panda jump 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.890
 which also brought a lot of noise 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.110
 one time even in the top in the play market 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 even in my opinion she is still in the top 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:35.390
 somewhere in 15 or 20 place so here 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.589
 we are offered to push a goal like this 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.570
 simple menu 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:43.159
 nothing superfluous honor board there if 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.769
 via and but connected to the internet 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.010
 phone or some other device 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.480
 can see the table of records 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 achievement shop 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.789
 improvement of any settings in which 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.359
 especially nothing and no graphics can 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.389
 make it worse and all click on 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.509
 shuriken we have a comic type 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:07.520
 prologue type prehistory of course 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.770
 nobody watch it all just 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.570
 will boil up 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.750
 by the way yes this game is a little lame 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.850
 the sensitivity of the game is really 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.020
 It turned out very interesting though it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.320
 kinda boring platformer but still 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.840
 the reaction as well as 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.420
 any other runner 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.210
 Well, you can say this type of game here 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.399
 there are all sorts of proteins that need 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.679
 buy for the coins we collect 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:41.579
 we do not collect more precisely and we receive for 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:44.350
 killing enemies ninja theme game 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.399
 Of course there are hints of Donat 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.450
 these are the coins that need more precise 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.130
 you can buy but in principle all 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.849
 normally improve and put big 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.239
 records 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:02.649
 you can not and you need to buy these coins 

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:05.380
 because I don't know about the week of the game I 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.599
 nafarmil only once 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.209
 all improve with this i'm no hot 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.930
 I haven't bought any starts yet. 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.099
 account 1,300 at the beginning of this here 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.280
 here are the buttons 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.890
 we buy for 500 coins each and then 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 improve for one and a half thousand that's what I 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 now and doing more precisely minus a drop on 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.510
 these coin improvements 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.000
 not divided into several as always here 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.000
 these here red they clean kill us 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.670
 with one hit and their reaction is better 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 all of them not so easy to kill but because 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.579
 they certainly give more coins than 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.730
 the rest there are also those who rush 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.270
 daggers can jump 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.260
 where 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.900
 can jump high double jump 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.560
 but I, as always, am not comfortable playing 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.670
 of course through the camera here there are three 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.600
 abilities 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.920
 the very top is the type we are very smart 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.100
 We run away from everyone we kill 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.890
 the lowest is the type in we jump and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.830
 Spinning with the ball, too, all kill and 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.150
 the second reminds me of ulta 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.040
 from dota 2 those who know they will understand there 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
 jagernaut same then we start 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.220
 just say ride over enemies and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.700
 severely punish now show how 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.880
 the very first looks like I was lucky 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.350
 there are many enemies not caught and of course 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.690
 I ran into Krasnova 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.090
 Well, in principle, here is such a game more 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.870
 and nothing more to tell now 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.000
 I show this shop's store on 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.610
 can get free coins for 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.500
 performance of any tasks there set 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.740
 any application from the developer 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.380
 and so on and power abs it just 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.950
 such here are all sorts of features like speed 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.940
 attacks with shadow clowns are type dodging 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.250
 run fast following this type here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.530
 some worse green all the of dota we 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.640
 just download everyone we kill it for everything 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.709
 nevermind, it's like we're spinning too 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.170
 all chop us all the hell in the very 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.900
 bottom is the multiplier of the coins that we 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.030
 give for killing enemies in principle here and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.790
 all that is in this game 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.730
 simple game 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.630
 but nevertheless it is very tightening 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.090
 it has an advertisement and I would still 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.090
 This game put four, because 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.240
 could add anything else 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.810
 so much more interesting but anyway couples 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.880
 fly the only way the battery she eats 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.310
 little processor is not particularly annoying 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.320
 the device does not heat up always 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.870
 pause management is simple 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.960
 overall a lot of advantages 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.990
 By the way, this game is available free of charge. 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.020
 Play Market has two versions of Neji 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.260
 revenge one out there score just there 2 and 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.480
 3 is it really some kind of dumb 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.020
 there is this well, in principle, you when there 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.970
 Youâ€™ll google search hey 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.010

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.470
 leave in the description under the video 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.110
 but for fun you can see what 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.850

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.040
