fish didn't when you're fishing with

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.550 
fish didn't when you're fishing with
your<00:02:16.010> with<00:02:16.490> your<00:02:16.520> rod<00:02:17.000> tip<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.170> front<00:02:18.500> of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
your with your rod tip out in front of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.130 
your with your rod tip out in front of
your<00:02:18.740> face<00:02:19.040> make<00:02:19.880> sure<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.569> doesn't<00:02:20.840> get

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
your face make sure that it doesn't get

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.680 
your face make sure that it doesn't get
too<00:02:21.440> low<00:02:21.819> when<00:02:22.819> you're<00:02:23.000> landing<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.480> fish

that but that's our fight

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.360 
that but that's our fight
my<00:03:10.040> point<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.610> men<00:03:11.320> get<00:03:12.320> zeroed<00:03:12.830> in<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.130> that

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.690 
my point is men get zeroed in on that
rod<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.090> you'll<00:03:14.870> be<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.890> much<00:03:15.950> ahead<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
rod and you'll be so much ahead of the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.910 
rod and you'll be so much ahead of the
game
