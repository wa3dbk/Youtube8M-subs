 All but one novice are in this game 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.770
 while Julia and her brother are here today to understand the game there is 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.050
 but also some like to become regular for the joy of the community

 invited to play along but no for some special games a certain 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.549
 If you have any previous knowledge then you should go up to six

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.449
 Hours of beginning to play important 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.409
 Despite the enormous time and effort Julia is the board game with the 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.339
 Community rather than playing the computer better would be first of all 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.559

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.369
 Finally, that means you measure yourself with others, but it's also a lot of fun 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.099
 The reaction was observed 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.799
