00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.939 
got all these girls from the Harrier and
I<00:04:58.370> thought<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:58.550> do<00:04:58.669> was<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:58.940> enemy<00:04:59.449> at<00:05:00.410> my<00:05:00.680> guess<00:05:00.860> I

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
I thought I do was a enemy at my guess I

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.140 
I thought I do was a enemy at my guess I
got<00:05:01.160> all<00:05:01.250> these<00:05:01.310> skills<00:05:01.520> from<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:01.789> hair<00:05:01.970> year

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.210 
got all these skills from the hair year
and<00:05:02.389> so<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.630> wasn't<00:05:02.870> too<00:05:03.050> sure<00:05:03.229> really<00:05:03.830> hit

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
and so I wasn't too sure really hit

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.620 
and so I wasn't too sure really hit
those<00:05:04.430> would<00:05:04.639> count<00:05:04.820> I<00:05:05.060> thought<00:05:05.330> maybe<00:05:05.539> I

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
those would count I thought maybe I

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.779 
those would count I thought maybe I
needed<00:05:05.870> one<00:05:05.990> from<00:05:06.229> me<00:05:06.949> so<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.400> wasn't<00:05:07.669> really

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
needed one from me so I wasn't really

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.930 
needed one from me so I wasn't really
sure<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:09.169> decided<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.099> wait<00:05:10.430> they<00:05:10.580> called<00:05:10.759> in
