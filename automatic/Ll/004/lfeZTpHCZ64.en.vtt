00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
gonna open it up got a flathead

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:53.620 
gonna open it up got a flathead
screwdriver<00:00:42.760> put<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:43.879> there

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.549 

alright<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.140> go

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
alright here we go

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.859 
alright here we go
a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:05.580> connector<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.410> two<00:01:07.710> wires

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
a little connector you have two wires

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
a little connector you have two wires
this<00:01:09.869> wire<00:01:10.050> looks<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.530> fine<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> see

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this wire looks just fine you can see

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.960 
this wire looks just fine you can see
this<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.720> snapped<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this one snapped so we're going to do is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.070 
this one snapped so we're going to do is
just<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.270> an<00:01:15.390> already<00:01:15.570> establish<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just get an already establish the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.460 
just get an already establish the
electrical<00:01:16.440> connection<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:18.470> then

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
electrical connection right here then

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.200 
electrical connection right here then
seal<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:22.520> okay<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
seal it back up okay so this is the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350 
seal it back up okay so this is the
inside<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.890> nice<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:27.180> I'm

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
inside it's nice as you can I'm

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
inside it's nice as you can I'm
going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> slide<00:01:27.690> this<00:01:27.810> forward

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
going to slide this forward

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.700 
going to slide this forward
I've<00:01:28.950> already<00:01:29.070> started<00:01:29.430> doing<00:01:29.550> it<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.990> took<00:01:30.990> my

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I've already started doing it I took my

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.170 
I've already started doing it I took my
wire<00:01:31.979> strippers<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> I'm<00:01:32.789> just<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.149> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
wire strippers and I'm just going to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.639 
wire strippers and I'm just going to
strip<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:35.130> white<00:01:35.399> wire<00:01:35.580> back<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.910> bit<00:01:36.530> give<00:01:37.530> me

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
strip that white wire back a bit give me

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.570 
strip that white wire back a bit give me
something<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> solder<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.399> it's<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.509> 22<00:01:40.020> gauge

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
something to solder to it's a 22 gauge

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.690 
something to solder to it's a 22 gauge
wire<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.149> can<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.390> rip<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.690> off<00:01:43.700> don't

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
wire so you can just rip it off don't

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
wire so you can just rip it off don't
need<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> whole<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.720> contact<00:01:46.110> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
need a whole lot for that contact but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.779 
need a whole lot for that contact but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
okay I've stripped both sides of the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.230 
okay I've stripped both sides of the
wire<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:07.440> I'm<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.099> also<00:02:08.580> slid<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
wire and I'm gonna I also slid the

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.510 
wire and I'm gonna I also slid the
section<00:02:09.780> down<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> give<00:02:10.319> me<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.679> more

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
I put a little bit of solder on each end

00:02:19.730 --> 00:03:00.330 
I put a little bit of solder on each end
not<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.000> king<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.510> soldering

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.930 

we<00:03:07.040> pull<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.430> down<00:03:07.610> here<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:10.549> wonderful

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
we pull on it down here it's wonderful

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.009 
we pull on it down here it's wonderful
about<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.360> it's<00:03:11.629> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> be<00:03:11.870> covered

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
about this is it's going to be covered

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.160 
about this is it's going to be covered
so<00:03:12.290> no<00:03:12.640> no<00:03:13.640> problem<00:03:14.060> how<00:03:14.209> horrible<00:03:14.810> my<00:03:14.930> solder

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
so no no problem how horrible my solder

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.479 
so no no problem how horrible my solder
looks<00:03:15.560> as<00:03:15.769> long<00:03:15.920> as<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:16.159> a<00:03:16.220> strong

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
looks as long as it's a strong

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.009 
looks as long as it's a strong
connection<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:17.090> going<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.269> be<00:03:17.360> good<00:03:17.450> let's

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
connection it's going to be good let's

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.920 
connection it's going to be good let's
see<00:03:18.230> if<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:19.120> makes<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.299> wake<00:03:20.450> up<00:03:22.120> aha<00:03:23.120> works

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
see if it makes it wake up aha works

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.449 
see if it makes it wake up aha works
again<00:03:24.910> okay<00:03:26.170> pretty<00:03:27.170> simple<00:03:27.560> just<00:03:27.950> has<00:03:28.160> two

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
again okay pretty simple just has two

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.479 
again okay pretty simple just has two
connections<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:29.709> resettle<00:03:30.709> those<00:03:30.920> two<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
connections you resettle those two and

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.390 
connections you resettle those two and
you<00:03:31.519> can<00:03:31.580> be<00:03:31.730> good<00:03:31.849> next<00:03:32.690> step<00:03:33.129> it's<00:03:34.129> going<00:03:34.340> to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
you can be good next step it's going to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
you can be good next step it's going to
be<00:03:34.519> me

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
be me

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.050 
be me
super<00:03:37.190> glue<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.459> over<00:03:37.640> top<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:40.549> I'll<00:03:40.970> be

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
super glue this over top and I'll be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.210 
super glue this over top and I'll be
ready<00:03:41.239> go<00:03:41.360> go<00:03:42.610> just<00:03:43.610> two<00:03:43.790> connectors<00:03:44.680> hey<00:03:45.709> next

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
ready go go just two connectors hey next

00:03:46.220 --> 00:04:06.820 
ready go go just two connectors hey next
is<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> magic<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.879> super<00:03:47.150> loop

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.710 

this<00:04:07.250> bottom<00:04:07.640> section<00:04:07.820> makes<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.330> sort<00:04:08.630> of
