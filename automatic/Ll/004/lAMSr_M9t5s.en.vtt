00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 at 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.279
 we met you 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.770
 metal detector my forehead and through it 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.540
 professional metal detector who 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.160
 I would advise to acquire 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.169
 advanced search professionals 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 users who are already 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.530
 familiar with the principles of metal detection and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.160
 spent some time with simpler ones 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.829
 models of metal detectors 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.760
 what is the tuning functional 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.850
 metal detector capabilities are great 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 quite difficult to control which 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:02.729
 Remember, too, is not easy to go and need 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 certain work experience therefore of course 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.680
 for the beginner youth metal detector in 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 mastering will be difficult enough of course 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 there are pre-installed programs 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.460
 included and so on but nonetheless 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.660
 that is, like this sound indication is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.150
 visual indication which 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.800
 provides the device in particular its 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.400
 opportunities for fine tuning for what 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.370
 you pay your own money they 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.770
 so complex that to master them 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.810
 such daughter will not work that is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 it needs to spend big enough 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 amount of time if you are new then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 probably better to pay attention to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.950
 some simpler models of that 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 less beginners gain 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 metal detector and for some 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.380
 time to master it 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 Well that is your will if you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.570
 This particular detector is interested in 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.580
 please purchase and 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.269
 and mastering perfection there is no limit 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.619
 metal detector is quite heavy 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.510
 so also draw on this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.810
 attention pay attention to him 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 individual features by 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.590
 configuration necessarily acquires 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.519
 such an expensive model 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 do not be lazy go to the store 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.150
 consult with sellers hold 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.409
 metal detector in hand as far as he 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.409
 your hand lies as comfortable as you can 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.390
 its application will seem convenient 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.170
 but imagine that you will be with him 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.739
 walk long enough for me 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 for example metal detector designs are not 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.780
 it seemed comfortable unfortunately although I 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.340
 waited on such expensive and problems there 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 the doctors 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.750
 much bigger some tactile 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.760
 sensations but none the less individual 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.700
 features of each person they 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 I differ that I can be uncomfortable 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.810
 very comfortable for you therefore I say that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.220
 Required upon purchase 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.959
 metal detector take it in hand 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 spin it 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.440
 further note that you are a metal detector 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.340
 acquire for a long time and 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.500
 you will go with him quite a lot 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.870
 I also want to warn everyone 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.220
 then acquire these metal detectors 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.079
 exploit them extremely gently 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.930
 because they don't like the band 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.190
 applications are very sensitive to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.400
 moisture ingress 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.069
 the control unit is therefore mandatory 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.530
 Take a case on the control unit and watch 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.620
 so no moisture 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.239
 condensation here and close was not otherwise 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.909
 you risk losing your warranty and 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.090
 naturally disable the device 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.560
 Alyona 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.989
 it will be quite expensive use 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.000
 only quality battery 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.009
 batteries or high-quality battery and 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.919
 again, otherwise you can 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:24.250
 damage the metal detector but here on 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.030
 empty can be pronounced a lot but 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.990
 actual acquisition decisions 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.260
 it is yours if you dream my 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.970
 forehead or tract acquire it 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.550
 if in doubt go to the store 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.710
 hold in your hands try how much 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:49.889
 this metal detector is right for you 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.889
 so see you and good luck in your search
