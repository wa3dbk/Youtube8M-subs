hello I'd like to talk about my favorite
small<00:00:15.400> everyday<00:00:15.850> carry<00:00:16.150> flashlights<00:00:16.840> a<00:00:17.110> lot

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
small everyday carry flashlights a lot

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.830 
small everyday carry flashlights a lot
has<00:00:18.100> changed<00:00:18.130> since<00:00:18.580> my<00:00:18.850> book<00:00:19.210> fight<00:00:19.539> at<00:00:19.690> night

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
has changed since my book fight at night

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.859 
has changed since my book fight at night
came<00:00:20.230> out<00:00:20.410> during<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:20.980> late<00:00:21.160> 90s<00:00:21.670> the<00:00:22.630> main

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
came out during the late 90s the main

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.040 
came out during the late 90s the main
thing<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.730> LEDs<00:00:24.730> have<00:00:25.060> replaced<00:00:25.420> incandescent

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
thing is LEDs have replaced incandescent

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.929 
thing is LEDs have replaced incandescent
lamps<00:00:26.710> as<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:26.980> emitter<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.310> choice<00:00:27.670> and

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
lamps as the emitter of choice and

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.120 
lamps as the emitter of choice and
that's<00:00:28.630> allowed<00:00:28.990> delights<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:29.710> get<00:00:29.830> smaller

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
that's allowed delights to get smaller

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.420 
that's allowed delights to get smaller
have<00:00:31.089> a<00:00:31.119> longer<00:00:31.570> run<00:00:31.749> time<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.349> just<00:00:33.130> get

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
have a longer run time and just get

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.650 
have a longer run time and just get
generally<00:00:33.940> more<00:00:34.090> capable<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:36.940> in<00:00:37.240> the<00:00:37.480> late

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
generally more capable back in the late

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.110 
generally more capable back in the late
90s<00:00:38.010> probably<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.070> lot<00:00:39.250> of<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.550> we're<00:00:39.790> carrying

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
90s probably a lot of you we're carrying

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.930 
90s probably a lot of you we're carrying
a<00:00:40.240> surefire<00:00:40.480> 6p<00:00:41.130> that<00:00:42.130> had<00:00:42.340> an<00:00:42.520> incandescent

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
a surefire 6p that had an incandescent

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.780 
a surefire 6p that had an incandescent
lamp<00:00:43.300> with<00:00:43.900> a<00:00:43.930> light<00:00:44.350> output<00:00:44.560> level<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.190> 65

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
lamp with a light output level of 65

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.690 
lamp with a light output level of 65
lumens<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:47.230> runtime<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.800> nominally<00:00:48.520> one

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
lumens and a runtime of nominally one

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.410 
lumens and a runtime of nominally one
hour<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:50.590> it's<00:00:51.250> possible<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.910> have<00:00:52.180> lights

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
hour now it's possible to have lights

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.620 
hour now it's possible to have lights
that<00:00:52.690> are<00:00:52.780> smaller<00:00:53.050> brighter<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.630> generally

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
that are smaller brighter and generally

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.780 
that are smaller brighter and generally
more<00:00:55.780> reliable<00:00:56.350> one<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.370> main<00:00:57.520> things

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
more reliable one of the main things

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.570 
more reliable one of the main things
that<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.240> an<00:00:58.780> advantage<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.440> an<00:00:59.590> LED<00:00:59.740> is<00:01:00.250> it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
that is an advantage with an LED is it

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.150 
that is an advantage with an LED is it
can't<00:01:00.820> burn<00:01:01.060> out<00:01:01.240> and<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.690> can't<00:01:01.900> break<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
can't burn out and it can't break it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.310 
can't burn out and it can't break it
also<00:01:03.460> will<00:01:03.610> let<00:01:03.730> you<00:01:03.880> get<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.269> light<00:01:04.839> levels

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
also will let you get to light levels

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.420 
also will let you get to light levels
out<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.950> same<00:01:06.189> led<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:08.650> current<00:01:09.070> everyday

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
out of the same led my current everyday

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.360 
out of the same led my current everyday
carry<00:01:09.670> light<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.240> this<00:01:10.720> surefire<00:01:11.230> l1<00:01:11.800> I<00:01:12.040> think

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
carry light is this surefire l1 I think

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.090 
carry light is this surefire l1 I think
the<00:01:12.460> latest<00:01:12.760> model<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.150> called<00:01:13.360> an<00:01:13.480> LX<00:01:13.930> one<00:01:14.230> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
the latest model is called an LX one it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.540 
the latest model is called an LX one it
takes<00:01:15.460> 1<00:01:16.200> 123<00:01:17.200> battery<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:20.280> opposed<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.400> the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
takes 1 123 battery as opposed to the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.210 
takes 1 123 battery as opposed to the
two<00:01:21.730> batteries<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.570> 6p<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.040> cheaper

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
two batteries of the 6p so it's cheaper

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.670 
two batteries of the 6p so it's cheaper
to<00:01:24.400> operate<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:25.090> from<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.420> standpoint<00:01:25.810> but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
to operate just from that standpoint but

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.640 
to operate just from that standpoint but
it<00:01:26.830> gets<00:01:26.890> better<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:28.330> light<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.810> brighter

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
it gets better this light is brighter

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.690 
it gets better this light is brighter
this<00:01:30.370> light<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.820> 80<00:01:31.300> lumens<00:01:31.630> instead<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.560> 65<00:01:33.190> 80

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
this light is 80 lumens instead of 65 80

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.180 
this light is 80 lumens instead of 65 80
lumens<00:01:34.030> for<00:01:34.420> two<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.900> half<00:01:35.110> hours<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.710> it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
lumens for two and a half hours and it's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.590 
lumens for two and a half hours and it's
also<00:01:36.400> got<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.090> low<00:01:37.720> beam<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:39.400> will<00:01:39.580> run<00:01:39.790> for<00:01:40.300> up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
also got a low beam that will run for up

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.920 
also got a low beam that will run for up
to<00:01:40.810> 16<00:01:41.320> hours<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.700> also<00:01:42.820> smaller<00:01:43.420> has<00:01:43.900> a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to 16 hours it's also smaller has a

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.590 
to 16 hours it's also smaller has a
pocket<00:01:44.260> clip<00:01:44.680> so<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.150> lot<00:01:46.420> more

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
pocket clip so this is a lot more

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.870 
pocket clip so this is a lot more
capable<00:01:47.200> than<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.740> 6p<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.490> everybody

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
capable than the 6p that everybody

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.940 
capable than the 6p that everybody
seemed<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.390> quite<00:01:49.600> happy<00:01:49.870> with<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
seemed to be quite happy with in the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.810 
seemed to be quite happy with in the
late<00:01:51.130> 90s<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:52.540> has<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.080> dead<00:01:53.860> man<00:01:54.130> types<00:01:54.520> which

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
late 90s this has a dead man types which

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.910 
late 90s this has a dead man types which
it's<00:01:55.510> called<00:01:55.720> a<00:01:55.780> Deadman<00:01:56.200> switch<00:01:56.560> because<00:01:56.740> if

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it's called a Deadman switch because if

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.990 
it's called a Deadman switch because if
you're<00:01:57.070> holding<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.460> down<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.850> get

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
you're holding it down and you get

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.370 
you're holding it down and you get
killed<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.510> going<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.870> off<00:01:58.900> the

killed it's going to go off the
advantage<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.370> that<00:02:00.430> is<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:01.299> have<00:02:01.330> absolute

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
advantage of that is you have absolute

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.690 
advantage of that is you have absolute
control<00:02:02.170> over<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.799> light<00:02:02.950> with<00:02:03.190> gross<00:02:03.460> motor
