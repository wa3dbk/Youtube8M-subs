00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.369 
allows you some kind of tonal coloration
additions<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.360> then<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.870> feedback<00:03:36.080> or

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
additions and then it's a feedback or

also tailor this boost to where it has a

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
sound to it I'm going to turn up the

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.550 
sound to it I'm going to turn up the
sound<00:04:29.750> control<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.139> show<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.320> what<00:04:30.440> that

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
sound control to show you what that

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.620 
sound control to show you what that
sounds<00:04:30.590> like<00:04:33.669> this<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.729> with<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.000> broader<00:04:35.300> peak

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
sounds like this is with a broader peak

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.360 
sounds like this is with a broader peak
to<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.169> rounder<00:04:36.710> mid-range<00:04:37.130> kind

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
to it so it's a rounder mid-range kind

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.890 
to it so it's a rounder mid-range kind
of<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.520> hump<00:04:37.700> in<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.300> boost<00:04:38.720> output<00:04:43.900> you

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
of a hump in the in the boost output you

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.969 
of a hump in the in the boost output you
can<00:04:44.990> hear<00:04:45.169> we're<00:04:45.289> starting<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.620> overdrive

those mid-range kind of frequencies it's

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.820 
those mid-range kind of frequencies it's
getting<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.080> little<00:04:48.139> bit<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.440> crunchy

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
some nice harmonic complexity to it when

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.640

we turn the sound control up the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.200 
we turn the sound control up the
mid-range<00:04:54.950> control<00:04:55.340> gets<00:04:55.520> peak<00:04:55.760> here<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.150> you

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
mid-range control gets peak here so you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.279 
mid-range control gets peak here so you

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
thing about it is it works at pretty

thing about it is it works at pretty

much any volume level I've actually got

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.300 
much any volume level I've actually got

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
the amp dial back to where it's at a

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.250 
the amp dial back to where it's at a

in your bedroom living room certainly
not<00:05:31.820> at<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:32.030> gig<00:05:32.240> level<00:05:32.570> at<00:05:32.660> all<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.110> yet<00:05:33.530> with

not at a gig level at all and yet with
this<00:05:33.770> pedal<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.190> can<00:05:34.340> push<00:05:34.490> those<00:05:34.670> instantly

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
this pedal I can push those instantly

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.060 
this pedal I can push those instantly
into<00:05:35.540> feedback<00:05:35.930> I've<00:05:36.560> turned<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.890> boost

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
into feedback I've turned the boost

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.410 
into feedback I've turned the boost
function<00:05:37.220> down<00:05:37.580> so<00:05:37.760> we're<00:05:37.910> basically<00:05:38.000> getting

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
function down so we're basically getting

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.820 
function down so we're basically getting
the<00:05:38.600> same<00:05:38.780> level<00:05:38.810> as<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.290> amplifier<00:05:39.680> would

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
the same level as the amplifier would

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.140 
the same level as the amplifier would
have<00:05:39.980> without<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.370> pedal<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.820> I've

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
have without the pedal and I've

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.730 
have without the pedal and I've
flattened<00:05:41.540> out<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.870> atonal<00:05:42.260> response<00:05:42.620> so

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
flattened out the atonal response so

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.050 
flattened out the atonal response so
we're<00:05:42.860> getting<00:05:42.950> just<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.280> clean<00:05:43.520> boost<00:05:43.820> out<00:05:44.030> of

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
we're getting just a clean boost out of

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.550 
we're getting just a clean boost out of

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
it actually there's no boost we're just

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.170 
it actually there's no boost we're just
getting<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.830> clean<00:05:46.070> tonal<00:05:46.490> signal<00:05:46.790> through<00:05:47.030> it

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
getting a clean tonal signal through it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.790 
getting a clean tonal signal through it
when<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:47.690> step<00:05:47.960> on<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.140> pedal<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:48.470> hold<00:05:48.650> it

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
when I step on the pedal and hold it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.380 
when I step on the pedal and hold it
down<00:05:48.980> the<00:05:49.490> guitar<00:05:49.790> will<00:05:49.910> instantly<00:05:50.240> go<00:05:50.360> into
