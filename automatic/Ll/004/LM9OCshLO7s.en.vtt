00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.480 

well<00:00:13.110> I'd<00:00:13.200> always<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> airplanes<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
well I'd always like the airplanes and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.400 
well I'd always like the airplanes and
they<00:00:14.670> they're<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.389> beautiful<00:00:15.929> little

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
they they're just beautiful little

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.529 
they they're just beautiful little
airplanes<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.250> idea<00:00:17.609> came<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:17.910> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
airplanes and the idea came about that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.980 
airplanes and the idea came about that
we'd<00:00:18.960> paint<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.150> with<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> original

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
we'd paint them like and with a original

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
we'd paint them like and with a original
culver<00:00:22.350> design<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.430> he<00:00:23.580> turned<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
culver design and as he turned out and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.910 
culver design and as he turned out and
they're<00:00:24.390> they're<00:00:25.140> making<00:00:25.410> quite<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> hit

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
they're they're making quite a hit

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
they're they're making quite a hit
together<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.820> thought<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> was<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> good<00:00:28.109> little

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
together I thought it was a good little

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.950 
together I thought it was a good little
airplane<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.189> old<00:00:29.310> man<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.810> was

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
airplane for an old man as which I was

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040 
airplane for an old man as which I was
approaching<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:32.579> fly<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.180> by<00:00:33.390> myself<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
approaching I can fly it by myself and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.240 
approaching I can fly it by myself and
go<00:00:34.350> places<00:00:35.040> easily<00:00:35.660> unlike<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:37.100> Bonanza<00:00:38.100> which

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
go places easily unlike my Bonanza which

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.090 
go places easily unlike my Bonanza which
is<00:00:38.430> more<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> sophisticated<00:00:39.120> airplane<00:00:40.100> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
is more of a sophisticated airplane the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
is more of a sophisticated airplane the
cobra<00:00:41.460> isn't<00:00:41.700> quite<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:42.000> fast<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.390> banana<00:00:42.690> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
cobra isn't quite as fast a banana but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
cobra isn't quite as fast a banana but
it<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.379> good<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:43.800> cross-country<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> can

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it is good for cross-country and I can

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.840 
it is good for cross-country and I can
just<00:00:45.450> use<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> knock<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> it's

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
just use it to knock around and it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
just use it to knock around and it's
dependable<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.239> easy<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.989> handle<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
dependable and easy to handle in the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.819 
dependable and easy to handle in the
hangar<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> ground<00:00:51.000> by<00:00:51.180> yourself<00:00:51.829> they

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
hangar on the ground by yourself they

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
hangar on the ground by yourself they
made<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.640> hundred<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.090> fifty<00:00:54.449> eight

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
made about three hundred and fifty eight

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
made about three hundred and fifty eight
of<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:54.960> most<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.190> gone<00:00:56.460> because

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of them most of them are gone because

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.299 
of them most of them are gone because
they're<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.239> wood<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:59.129> get

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
they're all wood and they just they get

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.430 
they're all wood and they just they get
left<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> rain<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> sleet<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
left out in the rain and the sleet and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.060 
left out in the rain and the sleet and
the<00:01:01.469> snow<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.780> eventually<00:01:03.780> rot<00:01:03.989> away<00:01:04.110> there's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the snow and eventually rot away there's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.870 
the snow and eventually rot away there's
probably<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> couple<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.600> dozen<00:01:06.860> flying<00:01:07.880> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
probably a couple of dozen flying and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.539 
probably a couple of dozen flying and
it's<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.049> rarity<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> novelty<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it's the rarity and the novelty of that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.120 
it's the rarity and the novelty of that
plus<00:01:12.420> they're<00:01:12.659> they're<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.200> nice<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.920> fly

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
plus they're they're very nice to fly

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
plus they're they're very nice to fly
there<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:15.119> fit<00:01:15.330> anything<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.020> she<00:01:16.860> fits

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there I don't fit anything but she fits

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
there I don't fit anything but she fits
in<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:17.790> looks<00:01:18.299> better<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> -<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
in it very well looks better in it - I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.460 
in it very well looks better in it - I
like<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> efficiency<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> fact<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
like the efficiency I like the fact that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.490 
like the efficiency I like the fact that
you've<00:01:23.159> got<00:01:23.310> 85<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.939> 90<00:01:24.180> horsepower<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you've got 85 or 90 horsepower you can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.520 
you've got 85 or 90 horsepower you can
still<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.890> 125<00:01:26.640> miles<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.060> hour<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.689> only<00:01:28.229> burn

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
still go 125 miles an hour and only burn

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
still go 125 miles an hour and only burn
five<00:01:28.740> gallons<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.159> gas<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.630> didn't<00:01:30.869> put

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
five gallons of gas so we didn't put

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.240 
five gallons of gas so we didn't put
electrical<00:01:31.439> systems<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
electrical systems in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.400 
electrical systems in
these<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.760> we<00:01:32.910> end<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.480> being<00:01:33.540> IFR<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
these so we end up not being IFR but

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.440 
these so we end up not being IFR but
that's<00:01:34.590> okay<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.160> just<00:01:35.190> going<00:01:36.120> fast

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that's okay we're just going fast

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.600 
that's okay we're just going fast
somewhere<00:01:36.840> anyway

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
somewhere anyway

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
somewhere anyway
and<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.940> what<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.150> enjoy<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.480> most<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and that's what I enjoy the most is the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590 
and that's what I enjoy the most is the
efficiency<00:01:40.580> when<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.700> got<00:01:41.910> this<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.510> we

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
efficiency when we got this one and we

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.180 
efficiency when we got this one and we
went<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> log<00:01:43.380> books<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.890> found

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
went through all the log books we found

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.430 
went through all the log books we found
out<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.700> airplane<00:01:45.270> had<00:01:45.810> been<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.260> Mexico

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
out that our airplane had been to Mexico

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.500 
out that our airplane had been to Mexico
it<00:01:47.010> had<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.580> Maine<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.150> had<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
it had been to Maine it had been to

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.990 
it had been to Maine it had been to
Washington<00:01:48.690> State<00:01:49.260> Texas<00:01:49.979> California<00:01:50.250> event

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
Washington State Texas California event

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.900 
Washington State Texas California event
all<00:01:51.150> over<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.900> country<00:01:52.320> prior<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.280> getting

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
all over the country prior to getting

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.030 
all over the country prior to getting
dismantled<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.750> 1960<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:55.830> just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
dismantled in 1960 so it was just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.190 
dismantled in 1960 so it was just
amazing<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.540> truly<00:01:57.690> just<00:01:57.900> got

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
amazing that they really truly just got

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
amazing that they really truly just got
in<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> went<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> consider<00:02:00.030> they

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
in and went when you consider they

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.570 
in and went when you consider they
didn't<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.540> headsets<00:02:00.930> or<00:02:01.770> intercoms

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
didn't have headsets or intercoms
