00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.779
 good afternoon my exhibition topics 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:12.240
 medical model also called communication 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.549
 orthodox native medicine 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 well this model was developed by 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.860
 eduardo mÃ©ndez is a model of ortiz and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
 This mercantilist individualist and 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.340
 effectively pragmatic this means 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 that seeks the usefulness of things 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.470
 and good since the end of the 18th century 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.200
 identify as the only way to 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.530
 take care of the disease 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.170
 a relationship between the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.660
 know and power will predominate the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.810
 sources of knowledge is outside 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.600
 the sociocultural factors 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.600
 since they are going to finish the biological 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.220
 and establishes as main parameters 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.020
 to understand and act on health and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.290
 the disease in the following traits or 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.680
 characteristics and these are biologism to 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.200
 story sociality iatrogenic 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.850
 the pragmatic effectiveness the relationship 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.050
 asymmetric doctor-patient and the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.050
 medication problems 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 each 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.860
 these traits or characteristics 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.369
 the first one that talks about what is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.799
 biology would request sociality this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.799
 it means that it is reduced to the individual 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.530
 at their levels and physics isolating the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.530
 all the historical social provision and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 spiritual 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.010
 part of the need to attack the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.920
 organ disease this wants 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.560
 say that he forgets to hurt 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.240
 the patient as such if not only 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.710
 has tried to study the east organ 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.540
 to try 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.090
 he forgets the individual conjunction 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.460
 integral one forgets that that individual 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.860
 is in a medium and that conditions and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.690
 relationships of that medium can also 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.330
 cause the individual's illness 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.910
 as for example in this case that is just 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.330
 it goes from the diseased organ to 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.730
 try to forget about the individual either in 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.960
 their poverty of this 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.360
 your cultural social problems 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.250
 the next point would be the effectiveness 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440
 pragmatics 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.350
 here 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.890
 curative enough in elimination of 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.890
 symptom 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.560
 and as for the other gene and co here 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.040
 can 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.560
 still know the monopolization of a knowing 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.110
 apart from the individual's knowledge of 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.550
 the things and associated social processes 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.550
 with health and disease 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.230
 as for the doctor-patient relationship 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.900
 which is the following characteristics here 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.900
 is based mostly on superiority 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.200
 a doctor about the patient based on the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.780
 to know 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.810
 the patient is in a state of 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 ignorance and becomes dependent 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.860
 of the doctor because it says that the doctor is 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.040
 who will solve your problem here 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.430
 the wisdom of the doctor is not shared 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.400
 towards the patient 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:39.180
 the patient goes and lets the doctor do 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.180
 your work without much less questions 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.000
 well the next point that would be the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.780
 health competition and electoral trend 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.319
 medical use here this 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.739
 comes from an emphasis of prevention 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.569
 of children newspapers 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.230
 is an easy conversion of health is 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.780
 commodity 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.520
 therefore this increases the costs and 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.520
 it can even increase the jatropha 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.900
 Well, as a conclusion, unlike 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.510
 of the clinical model clinical method 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.139
 this medical model and I want 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.210
 focus the organ to study isolating the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.169
 individual of all social and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.760
 religious citizens and that's why 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.760
 this model is also called orthodox
