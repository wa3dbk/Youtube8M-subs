00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
career align caliber 5 I thought this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.529 
career align caliber 5 I thought this
about<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> month<00:00:18.210> ago<00:00:20.060> from<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.150> authorized

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
about a month ago from an authorized

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.390 
about a month ago from an authorized
dealer<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.380> thinking<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.770> purchasing

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
dealer I was thinking about purchasing

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720 
dealer I was thinking about purchasing
it<00:00:23.550> from<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.720> internet<00:00:25.279> but<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.340> managed<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it from the internet but I managed to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
it from the internet but I managed to
get<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.090> 25<00:00:27.570> percent<00:00:28.050> off<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.920> retail

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
get about 25 percent off the retail

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.790 
get about 25 percent off the retail
price<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.630> actually<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.990> pretty<00:00:31.680> good

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
know I just love the simplicity of it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.199 
know I just love the simplicity of it
it's<00:00:46.499> not<00:00:47.659> it's<00:00:48.659> not<00:00:48.829> too<00:00:49.829> much<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.969> on

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:51.209 
it's not it's not too much going on on

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.869 
it's not it's not too much going on on
the<00:00:51.329> dial<00:00:51.569> it's<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.409> simple<00:00:52.879> elegant

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the dial it's just a very simple elegant

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.859 
the dial it's just a very simple elegant
yet<00:00:55.579> sporty<00:00:56.579> well<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.089> really<00:00:57.239> sporty<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
yet sporty well not really sporty but it

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.149 
yet sporty well not really sporty but it
can<00:00:58.049> still<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.289> won<00:00:58.760> fairly<00:00:59.760> casually<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
can still be won fairly casually so the

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.069 
can still be won fairly casually so the
movement<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.479> caliber<00:01:04.019> 5<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:06.780> reality

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
movement is a caliber 5 which in reality

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.569 
movement is a caliber 5 which in reality
is<00:01:07.560> talita

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
is talita

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.190 
is talita
SW<00:01:09.420> 200<00:01:10.049> movement<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.899> those<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
SW 200 movement and so for those of you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.010 
SW 200 movement and so for those of you
there<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:13.590> silly<00:01:14.189> TFW<00:01:14.640> 200<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> basically<00:01:15.719> like

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there no silly TFW 200 is basically like

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.149 
there no silly TFW 200 is basically like
an<00:01:16.140> ETA<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> 2<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:18.000> movement<00:01:18.740> with<00:01:19.740> an<00:01:19.859> extra

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
an ETA to a 2 for movement with an extra

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.139 
an ETA to a 2 for movement with an extra
Joule<00:01:20.399> so<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.179> got<00:01:21.329> 26<00:01:21.929> instead<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.409> 25

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
Joule so it's got 26 instead of 25

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:32.120 
Joule so it's got 26 instead of 25
joules<00:01:24.320> seen<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:26.000> ETA<00:01:27.000> movement<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
joules seen in the ETA movement so the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
joules seen in the ETA movement so the
watch<00:01:32.310> itself<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.969> sapphire<00:01:33.390> crystal<00:01:33.450> like
