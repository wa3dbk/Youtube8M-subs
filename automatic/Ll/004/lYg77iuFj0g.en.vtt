00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.640
 I do not 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.080
 very good to everyone to the left of 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.670
 how are you welcome back to 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.019
 channel and I would like to go through the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.880
 channel that is in the description since 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 He's the one who left me this game like this 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.029
 Thank you very much and once said 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.160
 I would like to respond to the maxims 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.880
 possible questions regarding advanced 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.500
 guard vaart 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.320
 so without further detours we go there in the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.320
 most repeated casual questions 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.910
 among them are the cinema navas mode 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.890
 warfare I can tell you from here 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.820
 that there is no cinema mode 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.100
 another thing that you have asked me 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.170
 also very successful my there is also no 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.730
 zombies at the moment that I have seen there 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 a level of zombies from what I've heard 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.469
 what is happening exo survival but 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.879
 surely not come or pass it to me 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.879
 another great question that you have 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.370
 asked a lot is about the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.629
 exoskeleton if I really see it well if 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.670
 I really liked the game if I 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 has really liked the skeleton what 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.329
 I think of him is that he gives all his life 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.559
 game is to say if he had not his 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.930
 skeleton there is a way that without 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.789
 exoskeleton the game is a call of duty 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.309
 more but what's cool about this video game 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.750
 of advanced work fer is that we have the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.200
 exoskeleton also have you 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.670
 asked many doubts about it 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 new accessory 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.380
 the new call of duty and I thought about 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.479
 make a series of how you learn better 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 said to handle your exoskeleton because 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.159
 has a lot of things and it really is a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 game that requires skill because what 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.540
 I say because everyone knows how to jump 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.670
 with the exoskeleton where in the case that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.890
 be xbox or double x in the case of play 3 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.110
 everyone will know how to move but there 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.420
 that know how to use it because it has many 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.070
 things that maybe you do not know and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.350
 He also has skills there 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.899
 enough that I will pass soon 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.610
 then to comment the morning surely 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.380
 we will be on the channel with others 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.720
 warfare so tomorrow you will have 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.369
 At least four or three videos are worth every 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 hour every hour and a half or so 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.670
 you will have new video another little thing that I 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.740
 have you also asked if the weapons 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.170
 are cited if there are many weapons and tadas 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
 if there is any accumulates in 94 say 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.340
 that I do not personally see a very game 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.869
 balanced I also listen to a video of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.090
 you think it looked like weapons 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.330
 different to me for example it seems very 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.890
 well similar similar to say some 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.989
 way not very similar between them 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.540
 although it is true that we 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.220
 something totally new that is that in each 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.040
 weapon for example puts 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.650
 the best weapon in cadence or in handling 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.390
 another weapon better arms the damage and such and such 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.460
 Well, it's pretty good but also 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 We will have supply package that we 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.630
 will go down in handling will not go up in the damage 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 and many things related to the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.690
 skill points also have me 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.310
 Asked about the best rifle 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.720
 assault for now I tell you not what 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.550
 I'm going to say because I have prepared a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.170
 weapon guide weapon guide that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.970
 you will see soon tomorrow and you will have 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.950
 the first chapter 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 so I already hope that you check the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 button likes another thing too 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.270
 best sub-machine gun I will recommend you 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.920
 from the beginning two weapons in the first 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.230
 place of assault rifles I recommend 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.300
 the vall 27 which is the first rifle of 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.370
 assault they give you is pretty good and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.340
 it's better than the ak 12 that I already say 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.380
 but already already and secondly to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.730
 recommend a sub-machine gun tell you not to 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.650
 I have tried everything that I still have to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.410
 try it blue the latest weapons sorry 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.110
 in the first rifles also goes very 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 well the caev e5 goes very very well too 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.340
 I'm going to do gun guides tomorrow 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.050
 better classes and so on so there are the 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.780
 Attentive to the channel is because it is approaching 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.680
 warfare birds in the purest state and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.850
 that nothing I hope you liked the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.890
 video hardware guys 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.590
 and I hope I have solved some 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.900
 another doubt deserves the game 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.120
 the penalty would totally have been at stake 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.690
 great call of duty that comes to us 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.690
 over
