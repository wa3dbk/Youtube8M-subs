one<00:02:14.590> game<00:02:14.830> per<00:02:15.040> episode<00:02:15.159> and<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:15.909> allow

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
one game per episode and that will allow

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.390 
one game per episode and that will allow
me<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:16.720> episode<00:02:17.200> for<00:02:17.500> each<00:02:17.739> day<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
me to do one episode for each day of the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
me to do one episode for each day of the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
week so that would be actually pretty

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.039

good<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:20.739> my<00:02:20.920> channel<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.489> relive<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:21.909> so<00:02:22.780> that

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049
