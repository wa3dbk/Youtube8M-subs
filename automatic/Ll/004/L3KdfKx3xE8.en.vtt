-<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.189> back<00:00:23.310> together

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
- which I get to put back together

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
- which I get to put back together
hopefully<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> pieces<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.619> um

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
hopefully all the pieces of that but um

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.820 
hopefully all the pieces of that but um
so<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> would<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.029> outside

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
so this would be on the very outside

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.910 
so this would be on the very outside
this<00:00:28.830> directly<00:00:29.369> touches<00:00:30.679> okay<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> just

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this directly touches okay that just

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.110 
this directly touches okay that just
goes<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> outside<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> swing<00:00:32.969> arm

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
goes on the outside of the swing arm

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.209 
goes on the outside of the swing arm
there's<00:00:33.360> no<00:00:33.649> washer<00:00:34.649> or<00:00:34.739> anything<00:00:35.040> basically

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
there's no washer or anything basically

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.770 
there's no washer or anything basically
that<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.640> fits<00:00:35.820> through<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.149> hole<00:00:36.360> air<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that just fits through that hole air and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.500 
that just fits through that hole air and
then<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> other<00:00:39.090> side<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
then and then on the other side of that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.280 
then and then on the other side of that
the<00:00:39.840> swing<00:00:40.079> arm<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.460> spacer<00:00:42.290> okay

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the swing arm is this the spacer okay

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.900 
the swing arm is this the spacer okay
and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.829> spacer<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.090> end<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
and then this spacer the end of this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
and then this spacer the end of this
directly<00:00:47.910> touches<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.879> guy<00:00:52.100> okay<00:00:53.129> hopefully

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
directly touches this guy okay hopefully

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.880 
directly touches this guy okay hopefully
that's<00:00:53.879> correct<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.320> guy<00:00:55.789> goes<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.090> here

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that's correct and this guy goes in here

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's correct and this guy goes in here
um<00:00:58.969> that's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.390> side<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.680> no

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
um that's the other side of a there's no

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
um that's the other side of a there's no
parts<00:01:02.100> missing<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:03.199> this<00:01:04.199> goes<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> here

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
parts missing in there this goes in here

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.469 
parts missing in there this goes in here
that<00:01:05.700> looks<00:01:05.880> okay<00:01:07.310> right<00:01:08.310> okay<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that looks okay right okay and on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.050 
that looks okay right okay and on the
other<00:01:12.600> side<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:16.740> comes<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
other side that comes out here and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
other side that comes out here and
connects<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> bad<00:01:23.970> boy<00:01:25.340> again

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
connects with this bad boy again

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.469 
connects with this bad boy again
hopefully<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> parts<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
hopefully all the parts where this is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.350 
hopefully all the parts where this is
the<00:01:27.570> part<00:01:27.780> we're<00:01:27.900> talking<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> moves

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
the part we're talking about it moves

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.460 
the part we're talking about it moves
back<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.509> forth<00:01:31.100> right<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.400> goes<00:01:32.579> there

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
back and forth right so that goes there

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
back and forth right so that goes there
okay<00:01:34.970> um<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.720> pulls<00:01:37.079> through<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.369> drive

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
okay um this pulls through the drive

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.260 
okay um this pulls through the drive
shaft<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.290> this<00:01:40.290> part<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> drive<00:01:41.009> shaft

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
shaft so this part of the drive shaft

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.319 
shaft so this part of the drive shaft
right<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.470> directly<00:01:43.470> presses<00:01:44.100> up<00:01:44.329> against

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
right here directly presses up against

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.980 
right here directly presses up against
this<00:01:46.430> hopefully<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.640> correct<00:01:48.000> okay<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
this hopefully that's correct okay so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
this hopefully that's correct okay so
that<00:01:49.200> pushes<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.430> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that pushes through here and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.520 
that pushes through here and then
directly<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.600> other<00:01:51.810> side<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.700> comes

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
directly on other side of that comes

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.270 
directly on other side of that comes
this<00:01:55.530> guy

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.230 

which<00:01:59.280> by<00:01:59.490> probably<00:01:59.790> didn't<00:01:59.970> have<00:02:00.060> tight

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
which by probably didn't have tight

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.360 
which by probably didn't have tight
enough<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.720> then<00:02:01.620> directly<00:02:01.890> under<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.190> side

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
enough and then directly under this side

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.820 
enough and then directly under this side
of<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.550> comes<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.330> guy<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> then<00:02:04.530> through

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
of that comes this guy and then through

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.609 
of that comes this guy and then through
the<00:02:04.950> hole<00:02:05.630> on<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> end<00:02:07.880> should<00:02:08.880> come<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.619> that's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the hole on the end should come a that's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
the hole on the end should come a that's
gonna<00:02:10.770> take<00:02:10.920> too<00:02:11.010> long<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.310> through<00:02:11.340> should

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
gonna take too long to go through should

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.810 
gonna take too long to go through should
come<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> cotter<00:02:13.200> pin<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.980> hopefully<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.700> sure

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
come a cotter pin to hopefully make sure

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.580 
come a cotter pin to hopefully make sure
in<00:02:15.180> disastrous<00:02:15.750> emergencies<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.380> doesn't

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
in disastrous emergencies it doesn't

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
in disastrous emergencies it doesn't
fall<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.680> that's<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.510> um

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
fall out so that's all of that um

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
fall out so that's all of that um
hopefully<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> pieces<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
hopefully all the pieces are there and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.240 
hopefully all the pieces are there and
it<00:02:23.670> works<00:02:24.260> like<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.470> supposed<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
it works like it's supposed to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.160 
it works like it's supposed to
I<00:02:26.280> hope<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.240> tell<00:02:27.390> me<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.630> works<00:02:27.960> out

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
I hope you can tell me if that works out

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.640 
I hope you can tell me if that works out
all<00:02:28.320> right<00:02:29.660> some<00:02:30.660> pieces<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.140> noticed<00:02:31.500> some

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
all right some pieces I noticed some

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.630 
all right some pieces I noticed some
things<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.100> some<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.310> interesting

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
things that I know some are interesting

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.070 
things that I know some are interesting
though<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.940> pulled<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.630> apart<00:02:33.750> is

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
though when I pulled the thing apart is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.680 
though when I pulled the thing apart is
this<00:02:34.260> guy<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.530> broken<00:02:34.890> or<00:02:35.760> maybe<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.180> design

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
this guy is broken or maybe is design

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.210 
this guy is broken or maybe is design
that<00:02:36.900> way<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.260> mean<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.710> don't<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:38.040> that's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that way I mean I don't think that's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.660 
that way I mean I don't think that's
designed<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:40.230> um<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.920> seems<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.460> do

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
designed that way but um it seems to do

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.950 
designed that way but um it seems to do
the<00:02:41.790> job<00:02:42.000> once<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.450> place<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.810> don't

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
the job once it's in place so I don't

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.010 
the job once it's in place so I don't
worry<00:02:43.110> about<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.490> brand<00:02:44.970> new<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.630> I'm

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
worry about it this is brand new and I'm

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.600 
worry about it this is brand new and I'm
from<00:02:46.260> dr.<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.650> TV<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.880> OH

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.490 

earlier<00:02:51.270> today<00:02:51.420> felt<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.260> had<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> little

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
earlier today felt like it had a little

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.170 
earlier today felt like it had a little
bend<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.950> maybe<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.340> dozen<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.820> was<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.060> my

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
bend in it maybe a dozen it was just my

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.450 
bend in it maybe a dozen it was just my
imagination

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
imagination

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.430 
imagination
no<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.580> does<00:02:56.730> kind<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> does<00:02:58.850> know<00:03:00.050> anyway<00:03:01.050> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
no it does kind of does know anyway so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
no it does kind of does know anyway so
this<00:03:01.560> guy<00:03:01.650> goes<00:03:01.920> through<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:03.030> I've<00:03:03.180> got

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
this guy goes through here all I've got

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.550 
this guy goes through here all I've got
for<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.840> guy<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:05.240> this<00:03:06.470> lock<00:03:07.470> nut<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:10.410> had

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
for this guy is this lock nut and I had

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.340 
for this guy is this lock nut and I had
it<00:03:10.680> in<00:03:10.800> this<00:03:10.950> way<00:03:11.750> actually<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:12.930> had<00:03:13.080> bolt

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it in this way actually so I had bolt

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.590 
it in this way actually so I had bolt
and<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.290> exhaust<00:03:18.320> bracket<00:03:19.320> went<00:03:20.160> here

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
and then the exhaust bracket went here

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.050 
and then the exhaust bracket went here
right<00:03:21.600> here<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.989> then<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> spacer<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.370> then

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
right here and then the spacer and then

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.750 
right here and then the spacer and then
the<00:03:24.330> spacer<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:24.930> directly<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.470> against<00:03:25.890> this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
the spacer but directly up against this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.040 
the spacer but directly up against this
guy

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
guy

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.030 
guy
and<00:03:28.050> bolt<00:03:28.320> went<00:03:28.500> through<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.800> then<00:03:28.890> though<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
and bolt went through and then though I

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.280 
and bolt went through and then though I
think<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.340> either<00:03:29.430> side<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.120> lock<00:03:31.050> nut<00:03:31.260> on

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
think on either side is the lock nut on

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.500 
think on either side is the lock nut on
the<00:03:31.410> other<00:03:31.470> side<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.860> hopefully<00:03:31.920> that's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
the other side so hopefully that's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.490 
the other side so hopefully that's
that's<00:03:33.510> right<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.959> other<00:03:34.080> thing<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.290> looked

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that's right the other thing that looked

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.320 
that's right the other thing that looked
kind<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.739> weird<00:03:34.800> -<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.670> look<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.120> I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
kind of weird - this is look at this I

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.300 
kind of weird - this is look at this I
don't<00:03:36.390> know<00:03:36.630> what<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.900> they<00:03:37.650> supposed<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> be

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
don't know what that they supposed to be

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.060 
don't know what that they supposed to be
bent<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.700> no<00:03:39.209> or<00:03:39.450> not<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.590> seems<00:03:40.800> to

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
bent like that no or not it seems to

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.470 
bent like that no or not it seems to
work<00:03:41.250> my<00:03:41.459> rear<00:03:41.850> brake<00:03:42.090> seems<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.390> work

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
work my rear brake seems to work

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.360 
work my rear brake seems to work
fantastically<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:46.850> baby<00:03:47.850> Huey<00:03:48.180> suggestion<00:03:48.780> of

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
fantastically so baby Huey suggestion of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.530 
fantastically so baby Huey suggestion of
loosening<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> plastic<00:03:50.910> bolt<00:03:51.120> there<00:03:51.330> was

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
loosening the plastic bolt there was

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.449 
loosening the plastic bolt there was
correct<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.380> actually<00:03:52.830> was<00:03:52.950> too<00:03:53.100> tight<00:03:53.310> when

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
correct and actually was too tight when

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.070 
correct and actually was too tight when
I<00:03:53.520> finally<00:03:53.700> got<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.940> light<00:03:54.090> working<00:03:54.450> by

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
I finally got the light working by

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.710 
I finally got the light working by
setting<00:03:55.410> up<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> ground<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:57.300> probably<00:03:57.540> can't

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
setting up the ground you probably can't

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.090 
setting up the ground you probably can't
see<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.050> put<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.260> new<00:03:58.440> screw<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:58.980> in

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
see that I put a new screw on there in

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.840 
see that I put a new screw on there in
touch<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.700> ground<00:03:59.940> there

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
touch to the ground there

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.570 
touch to the ground there
that<00:04:02.850> seemed<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.240> fix<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.930> problem<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:05.340> came

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
that seemed to fix that problem it came

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.740 
that seemed to fix that problem it came
on<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.760> brake<00:04:06.030> light<00:04:06.180> came<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.630> then<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
on the brake light came on and then I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.120 
on the brake light came on and then I
had<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> loosen<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> would<00:04:07.680> work

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
had to loosen it so that it would work

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.090 
had to loosen it so that it would work
you<00:04:08.610> know<00:04:08.700> brake<00:04:08.880> light<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.180> normal<00:04:09.860> taillight

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.160 

if<00:04:14.100> you<00:04:14.160> want<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.370> see<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.520> shot<00:04:15.170> hopefully

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
if you want to see this shot hopefully

if you want to see this shot hopefully
these<00:04:16.260> are<00:04:16.320> all<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> pieces<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:16.950> came<00:04:17.190> off

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
these are all the pieces that came off

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.910 
these are all the pieces that came off
here<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.019> imagine<00:04:19.850> this<00:04:20.850> red<00:04:21.030> part<00:04:21.740> goes<00:04:22.740> on

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
here and I imagine this red part goes on

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.090 
here and I imagine this red part goes on
and<00:04:23.850> inside<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.870> there<00:04:25.490> but<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> spring<00:04:28.100> then

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
and inside of there but the spring then

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.520 
and inside of there but the spring then
I<00:04:29.460> put<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:29.970> on<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> other<00:04:31.110> side<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.380> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
I put this on the other side of the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.970 
I put this on the other side of the
spring<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.220> then<00:04:32.880> at<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.090> bottom<00:04:33.240> here<00:04:33.660> I

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
spring and then at the bottom here I

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.840 
spring and then at the bottom here I
just<00:04:34.980> rest<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.870> with<00:04:37.230> this<00:04:37.470> bumper<00:04:37.890> or

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
just rest this with this bumper or

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.080 
just rest this with this bumper or
grommet<00:04:39.419> or<00:04:39.480> I<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:39.930> know<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.500> called<00:04:41.090> at

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
grommet or I don't know that's called at

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.700 
grommet or I don't know that's called at
the<00:04:42.210> bottom<00:04:42.480> there<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.290> make<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:43.680> that

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
the bottom there to just make it so that

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.370 
the bottom there to just make it so that
this<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.450> imagine<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.570> bumps<00:04:45.840> up<00:04:45.900> against<00:04:46.230> there

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
this I imagine it bumps up against there

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.190 
this I imagine it bumps up against there
doesn't<00:04:46.710> ruin<00:04:47.040> anything<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.020> fully

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
doesn't ruin anything so in a fully

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.710 
doesn't ruin anything so in a fully
compresses<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:49.890> just<00:04:50.070> hits<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:51.600> hopefully

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
compresses it just hits it so hopefully

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.230 
compresses it just hits it so hopefully
that's<00:04:52.020> all<00:04:52.140> correct<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.790> think<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:53.940> rest<00:04:54.090> of

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
that's all correct I think the rest of

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.630 
that's all correct I think the rest of
his<00:04:54.330> heckler<00:04:55.430> spray<00:04:56.430> some<00:04:56.610> on<00:04:56.700> there<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.550> yeah

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
his heckler spray some on there so yeah

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.900 
his heckler spray some on there so yeah
the<00:04:59.730> other<00:04:59.790> problem<00:05:00.210> was<00:05:01.310> on<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.430> other<00:05:02.550> side

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.780 

relating<00:05:05.910> with<00:05:06.030> these<00:05:07.430> foot<00:05:08.430> pegs<00:05:08.669> in<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
relating with these foot pegs in the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.640 
relating with these foot pegs in the
kickstand

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.110 

so<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.680> don't<00:05:18.009> know<00:05:18.099> if<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.370> bent<00:05:18.759> or<00:05:18.970> not

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
so I don't know if this is bent or not

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.100 
so I don't know if this is bent or not
bent<00:05:19.479> hopefully<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:19.990> can<00:05:20.080> see<00:05:21.960> from<00:05:22.960> the

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
bent hopefully you can see from the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.040 
bent hopefully you can see from the
video<00:05:24.060> basically<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.509> noticed<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:25.960> was

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
video basically I have noticed I was

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.409 
video basically I have noticed I was
gonna<00:05:26.139> use<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.650> kickstand<00:05:27.190> if<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.150> down

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
gonna use the kickstand if it's down

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.420 
gonna use the kickstand if it's down
it's<00:05:28.810> sort<00:05:29.020> of<00:05:29.110> sometimes<00:05:29.620> stays<00:05:30.039> where<00:05:30.280> it<00:05:30.370> is

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
it's sort of sometimes stays where it is

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.730 
it's sort of sometimes stays where it is
and<00:05:30.490> then<00:05:30.699> sometimes<00:05:31.060> it<00:05:31.180> serves<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.740> lean

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
and then sometimes it serves to lean

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.710 
and then sometimes it serves to lean
farther<00:05:33.220> forward<00:05:33.610> far<00:05:34.120> farther<00:05:34.360> toward<00:05:34.660> the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
farther forward far farther toward the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.020 
farther forward far farther toward the
left<00:05:34.960> than<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.530> did<00:05:35.620> initially<00:05:35.949> so<00:05:36.819> I<00:05:36.849> don't

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
left than it did initially so I don't

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.510 
left than it did initially so I don't
know<00:05:37.120> if<00:05:37.270> something<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.900> mean<00:05:38.020> this<00:05:38.430> seems<00:05:39.430> to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
know if something I mean this seems to

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.550 
know if something I mean this seems to
have<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.639> bit<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:39.910> bit<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.900> plane<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.139> don't<00:05:41.380> know

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
have a bit of bit of plane I don't know

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.950 
have a bit of bit of plane I don't know
if<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:41.800> supposed<00:05:42.009> to<00:05:42.190> be<00:05:42.340> that<00:05:42.430> way<00:05:42.490> or<00:05:42.699> not

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
if that's supposed to be that way or not

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.210 
if that's supposed to be that way or not
or<00:05:43.960> what's<00:05:44.139> going<00:05:44.440> on<00:05:44.560> there<00:05:44.770> maybe<00:05:45.069> that

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
or what's going on there maybe that

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.909 
or what's going on there maybe that
needs<00:05:45.370> to<00:05:45.490> be<00:05:45.520> tightened<00:05:45.729> up<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:47.289> also<00:05:47.470> when

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
needs to be tightened up and also when

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:54.089 
needs to be tightened up and also when
it's<00:05:48.039> up<00:05:49.830> there<00:05:50.830> sitting<00:05:50.979> around<00:05:53.099> you'll

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
it's up there sitting around you'll

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.580 
it's up there sitting around you'll
notice<00:05:54.190> its<00:05:54.610> relationship<00:05:55.389> to<00:05:57.180> this<00:05:58.590> front

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
notice its relationship to this front

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.950 
notice its relationship to this front
sprocket<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.759> get<00:06:01.479> something<00:06:01.750> straight

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
sprocket so I get something straight

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.320 
sprocket so I get something straight
here<00:06:03.539> you<00:06:04.539> can<00:06:04.720> kind<00:06:04.930> of<00:06:04.990> see<00:06:06.030> or<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:07.120> seems

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
here you can kind of see or it seems

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.020 
here you can kind of see or it seems
like<00:06:07.479> it's<00:06:07.630> hitting<00:06:07.780> my<00:06:07.990> chain<00:06:08.319> I<00:06:08.909> don't<00:06:09.909> know

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
like it's hitting my chain I don't know

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.159 
like it's hitting my chain I don't know
if<00:06:10.120> it<00:06:10.180> just<00:06:10.300> gets<00:06:10.449> out<00:06:10.630> of<00:06:10.659> the<00:06:10.750> way<00:06:10.900> cuz<00:06:11.139> a

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
if it just gets out of the way cuz a

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:17.040 
if it just gets out of the way cuz a
chain<00:06:14.250> is<00:06:15.250> moving<00:06:15.610> in<00:06:15.729> this<00:06:16.240> direction<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.930> hit

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
chain is moving in this direction I hit

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.540 
chain is moving in this direction I hit
this<00:06:17.169> way<00:06:17.349> and<00:06:17.469> then<00:06:17.560> down<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.919> out<00:06:18.070> this<00:06:18.310> way

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
this way and then down and out this way

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.610 
this way and then down and out this way
should<00:06:19.389> she<00:06:19.539> move<00:06:19.719> it<00:06:19.810> out<00:06:19.930> of<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.050> way<00:06:20.169> no

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
should she move it out of the way no

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.709 
should she move it out of the way no
that's<00:06:20.860> really<00:06:21.009> actually<00:06:21.729> causing<00:06:22.270> a<00:06:22.330> problem

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
that's really actually causing a problem

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.899 
that's really actually causing a problem
over<00:06:22.780> just<00:06:23.050> sort<00:06:23.199> of<00:06:23.259> inconvenient<00:06:23.889> if<00:06:24.789> you

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
over just sort of inconvenient if you

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:26.159 
over just sort of inconvenient if you
look<00:06:25.090> at<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.300> end<00:06:25.419> of<00:06:25.539> there<00:06:25.690> though<00:06:25.840> you<00:06:25.900> can

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
look at the end of there though you can

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.450 
look at the end of there though you can
see<00:06:26.940> there's<00:06:27.940> some<00:06:28.740> marks<00:06:29.740> where<00:06:30.009> the<00:06:30.250> chain

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
see there's some marks where the chain

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:38.360 
see there's some marks where the chain
has<00:06:30.699> hit<00:06:30.909> it<00:06:31.030> in<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.120> past<00:06:33.060> get<00:06:34.060> aside

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.029 

would<00:06:39.370> see<00:06:39.580> a<00:06:39.879> little<00:06:40.659> mark<00:06:40.900> there<00:06:41.039> what

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
would see a little mark there what

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.920 
would see a little mark there what
change<00:06:42.280> did<00:06:42.460> it

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
change did it

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.779 
change did it
so<00:06:44.319> anyway<00:06:44.560> according<00:06:44.979> to<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.310> advice<00:06:45.550> if<00:06:45.699> I

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
so anyway according to the advice if I

so anyway according to the advice if I
have<00:06:45.909> all<00:06:46.030> the<00:06:46.120> correct<00:06:46.360> parts<00:06:46.870> I<00:06:47.729> should<00:06:48.729> be

have all the correct parts I should be

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.330 
have all the correct parts I should be

able to reassemble my swing arm put it

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.149 
able to reassemble my swing arm put it

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.330 
all back on with all the pieces in the
correct<00:06:57.430> order<00:06:57.639> which<00:06:58.090> it<00:06:58.270> was<00:06:58.449> it<00:06:58.840> was<00:06:58.990> before

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
correct order which it was it was before

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.659 
correct order which it was it was before
but<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.490> problem<00:07:01.000> I<00:07:01.090> had<00:07:01.330> was<00:07:01.810> twofold<00:07:02.080> one

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
but the problem I had was twofold one

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.219 
but the problem I had was twofold one
wasn't<00:07:03.669> tight<00:07:04.180> enough<00:07:04.210> the<00:07:04.629> axle<00:07:04.960> wasn't

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
wasn't tight enough the axle wasn't

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.939 
wasn't tight enough the axle wasn't
tight<00:07:05.440> enough<00:07:05.470> on<00:07:06.220> there<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.870> chain<00:07:08.199> may

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
tight enough on there and the chain may

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.350 
tight enough on there and the chain may
have<00:07:09.099> been<00:07:09.250> too<00:07:09.669> tight

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
have been too tight

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.209 
have been too tight
meaning<00:07:11.169> when<00:07:11.379> I<00:07:11.409> went<00:07:11.590> over<00:07:11.770> a<00:07:11.800> bump<00:07:12.099> it

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:12.219 
meaning when I went over a bump it

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.709 
meaning when I went over a bump it
actually<00:07:12.520> screwed<00:07:13.509> everything<00:07:13.750> up<00:07:13.990> so

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719 
actually screwed everything up so

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.580 
actually screwed everything up so
everything<00:07:16.719> looks<00:07:16.840> ok<00:07:17.139> I'll<00:07:17.319> put<00:07:17.409> it<00:07:17.530> back

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
everything looks ok I'll put it back

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.629 
everything looks ok I'll put it back
together<00:07:17.740> at<00:07:17.919> night<00:07:18.039> and<00:07:18.280> we'll<00:07:18.400> give<00:07:18.550> it<00:07:18.580> a

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
together at night and we'll give it a

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:18.869 
together at night and we'll give it a
shot

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 
shot

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.870 
shot
thanks<00:07:19.509> for<00:07:19.599> your<00:07:19.659> help<00:07:19.780> guys
