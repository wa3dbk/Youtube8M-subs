00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.639 

I<00:00:03.920> think<00:00:05.839> there's<00:00:06.839> no<00:00:06.960> positives<00:00:07.410> when

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
I think there's no positives when

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.650 
I think there's no positives when
there's<00:00:08.490> less<00:00:08.670> positives<00:00:09.179> when<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.450> get<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
there's less positives when you get the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.690 
there's less positives when you get the
result<00:00:09.929> like<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.370> when<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.460> came<00:00:11.639> back

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
result like this when we came back

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700 
result like this when we came back
strong<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.929> second<00:00:13.230> half<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.469> try<00:00:13.650> to

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
strong in the second half to try to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.900 
strong in the second half to try to
invert<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:15.170> result<00:00:16.580> managed<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> score

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
invert the result managed to score

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.679 
invert the result managed to score
within<00:00:18.150> 10<00:00:18.750> minutes<00:00:19.340> but<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.710> mean<00:00:23.689> when

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
within 10 minutes but but I mean when

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.380 
within 10 minutes but but I mean when
when<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> second<00:00:25.439> half<00:00:25.560> looked<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> be

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
when a second half looked to go to be

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.870 
when a second half looked to go to be
going<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:27.810> way<00:00:28.279> Liverpool<00:00:29.279> made<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> most

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
going our way Liverpool made the most

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
going our way Liverpool made the most
out<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.240> good<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.599> opportunity<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.260> they

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
out of a good good opportunity that they

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
out of a good good opportunity that they
had<00:00:31.669> and<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.750> managed<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.780> take<00:00:34.020> an

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
had and they managed to take an

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
had and they managed to take an
important<00:00:35.010> three<00:00:35.160> points<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> Stanford

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
important three points on a Stanford

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840 
important three points on a Stanford
bridge<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> decisive<00:00:38.399> moment

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
bridge so it's a it's a decisive moment

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.280 
bridge so it's a it's a decisive moment
that<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> changes<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> nature<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that that changes the nature of how the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250 
that that changes the nature of how the
game<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:41.149> because<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.270> were<00:00:42.420> we're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
game was going because we were we're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.529 
game was going because we were we're
looking<00:00:43.590> good<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.460> mean<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.000> why<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.329> even

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
looking good I mean that's why we even

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
looking good I mean that's why we even
decided<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> changes<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
decided to not to do a lot of changes in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.670 
decided to not to do a lot of changes in
the<00:00:48.480> second<00:00:48.780> half<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.230> their<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the second half with their with the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.490 
the second half with their with the
substitutions<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.700> still<00:00:50.969> had<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> most

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
substitutions that we still had the most

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380 
substitutions that we still had the most
looking<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.920> positive<00:00:53.390> creating

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
looking good positive creating

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.340 
looking good positive creating
opportunities<00:00:56.000> but<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.719> Liverpool<00:00:58.079> made<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
opportunities but but Liverpool made the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
opportunities but but Liverpool made the
most<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.649> them<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.070> opportunity<00:00:59.930> in<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
most of them one opportunity in the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
most of them one opportunity in the
second<00:01:01.379> half<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.710> take<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:03.059> important

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
second half to take a very important

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
second half to take a very important
three<00:01:03.660> points<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.210> course<00:01:06.450> there's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
three points I think of course there's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.330 
three points I think of course there's
not<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.170> improvement<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
not there's an improvement from the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
not there's an improvement from the
first<00:01:08.700> half<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> second<00:01:09.330> half<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> terms

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
first half to the second half in terms

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
first half to the second half in terms
of<00:01:09.869> aggressiveness<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.250> way<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> team

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of aggressiveness and the way the team

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
of aggressiveness and the way the team
played<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.049> sufficient<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.680> us<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.950> get

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
played but not sufficient for us to get

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
played but not sufficient for us to get
the<00:01:14.250> three<00:01:14.400> points

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560 

no<00:01:20.160> but<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> second<00:01:20.850> half<00:01:20.940> is<00:01:21.090> exactly<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
no but the second half is exactly the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.530 
no but the second half is exactly the
opposite<00:01:21.870> so<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:23.820> plays<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> detail<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
opposite so it plays to that detail in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.750 
opposite so it plays to that detail in
terms<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> result<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.710> happened<00:01:29.580> I

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
terms of the result that happened I

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.600 
terms of the result that happened I
think<00:01:30.390> Liverpool<00:01:31.040> showed<00:01:32.040> aggressiveness

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
think Liverpool showed aggressiveness

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.560 
think Liverpool showed aggressiveness
show<00:01:32.820> commitment<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> strength<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.090> press

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
show commitment and strength with press

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
show commitment and strength with press
very<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.500> first<00:01:37.650> half<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
very well in the first half and in the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
very well in the first half and in the
second<00:01:38.610> half<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.760> exactly<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> opposite<00:01:40.040> so

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
second half was exactly the opposite so

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.320 
second half was exactly the opposite so
I<00:01:41.070> don't<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.550> was<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:41.940> decisive

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
I don't think that was the decisive

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.610 
I don't think that was the decisive
moment<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.990> game<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.320> he<00:01:43.350> said<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
moment of the game that he said the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.620 
moment of the game that he said the
moment<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> game<00:01:44.160> for<00:01:44.400> me<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
moment of the game for me is is of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
moment of the game for me is is of
course<00:01:45.890> Johnson<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.340> caught<00:01:47.580> free<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.120> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
course Johnson got caught free on the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.730 
course Johnson got caught free on the
opposite<00:01:49.140> side<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.890> ball<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:51.140> any<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.710> he

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
opposite side of the ball and any and he

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:02.990 
opposite side of the ball and any and he
got<00:01:52.890> through<00:01:53.390> on<00:01:54.390> goal<00:01:54.690> too<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> time<00:02:02.940> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
got through on goal too is it time to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740 
got through on goal too is it time to
reconsider<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.990> strategy<00:02:04.910> no<00:02:05.910> because<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
reconsider that strategy no because I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.530 
reconsider that strategy no because I
mean<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.770> position<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.509> we

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
mean in a position that that we that we

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.420 
mean in a position that that we that we
are<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.140> terms<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> league<00:02:12.620> salvaging<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
are in terms of the league salvaging a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.660 
are in terms of the league salvaging a
point<00:02:15.830> isn't<00:02:16.830> what<00:02:16.980> we're<00:02:17.100> looking<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
point isn't what we're looking for I

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.310 
point isn't what we're looking for I
think<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> shorten<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
think when you have to shorten the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.900 
think when you have to shorten the
distance<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.860> mean<00:02:20.010> today<00:02:20.130> was<00:02:20.400> an<00:02:20.520> opportunity

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
distance I mean today was an opportunity

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.660 
distance I mean today was an opportunity
for<00:02:21.000> us<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.390> third<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:23.160> want<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.459> win<00:02:23.580> these

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
for us to go third we want to win these

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.009 
for us to go third we want to win these
games<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> willingness<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.810> therefore

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
games and the willingness was therefore

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.990 
games and the willingness was therefore
to<00:02:25.260> win<00:02:25.470> these<00:02:25.590> games<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.980> again<00:02:26.250> looked<00:02:26.610> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
to win these games and again looked to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.310 
to win these games and again looked to
be<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.450> our<00:02:27.840> control<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.410> think<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:30.320> mean<00:02:31.820> even<00:02:32.820> if

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
be in our control I think I mean even if

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.530 
be in our control I think I mean even if
we<00:02:34.320> have<00:02:34.500> taken<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:34.950> approach<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.420> are

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
we have taken that approach that you are

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.000 
we have taken that approach that you are
that<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.959> are<00:02:36.989> saying<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.620> doesn't<00:02:37.709> mean<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that you are saying it doesn't mean that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.130 
that you are saying it doesn't mean that
we<00:02:38.670> won't<00:02:38.820> be<00:02:38.970> suffering<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.510> row<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.989> same

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
we won't be suffering a row the same

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.320 
we won't be suffering a row the same
because<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> end<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.310> see<00:02:41.549> more

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
because in the end you can see more

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.090 
because in the end you can see more
space<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.870> opponent<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
space to the opponent and you can get to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.810 
space to the opponent and you can get to
you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:44.970> suffer<00:02:45.239> look<00:02:45.360> all<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> same<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.680> i

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
you can suffer look all the same so i

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.670 
you can suffer look all the same so i
think<00:02:47.820> i<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:51.470> situation<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
think i think the the situation in the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.440 
think i think the the situation in the
league<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.010> not<00:02:53.130> it's<00:02:53.549> not<00:02:53.640> good<00:02:53.820> for<00:02:53.850> us<00:02:54.030> it's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
league is not it's not good for us it's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.160 
league is not it's not good for us it's
not<00:02:54.540> impossible<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.230> turn<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.040> around<00:02:57.170> it's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
not impossible to turn it around it's

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
not impossible to turn it around it's
not<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.739> brightest<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.160> starts<00:02:59.630> over<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
not the brightest of starts over the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.420 
not the brightest of starts over the
Premiership<00:03:01.140> for<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.620> Chelsea<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> last

Premiership for for Chelsea in the last
ten<00:03:02.910> years<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> belief<00:03:05.549> is<00:03:05.730> there

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
ten years but but the belief is there

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060 
ten years but but the belief is there
from<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> team<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> try<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.380> deliver<00:03:07.620> things

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
from the team to try to deliver things

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.800 
from the team to try to deliver things
and<00:03:08.310> that's<00:03:08.459> that's<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.000> we<00:03:09.570> have<00:03:09.660> to

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and that's that's what we we have to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.800 
and that's that's what we we have to
focus<00:03:09.930> yeah<00:03:10.670> doesn't<00:03:11.670> look<00:03:11.790> good<00:03:12.030> 12<00:03:12.510> points

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
focus yeah doesn't look good 12 points

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.090 
focus yeah doesn't look good 12 points
behind<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.110> leader<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> strong<00:03:13.830> leader

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
behind the leader is a strong leader

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.870 
behind the leader is a strong leader
that<00:03:15.060> hasn't<00:03:15.360> lost<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.739> points<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.790> a

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
that hasn't lost the points just just a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.740 
that hasn't lost the points just just a
draw<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.739> mean<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.880> December<00:03:21.390> fixtures

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
draw but I mean the December fixtures

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.020 
draw but I mean the December fixtures
give<00:03:22.080> us<00:03:22.230> hope<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.830> we<00:03:23.070> are<00:03:23.160> able<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.430> make<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
give us hope if we are able to make the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.670 
give us hope if we are able to make the
most<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.600> that's<00:03:24.840> where<00:03:25.080> our<00:03:25.110> focus<00:03:25.260> is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
most of it and that's where our focus is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.370 
most of it and that's where our focus is
at<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> moment

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.840 

I<00:03:34.870> think<00:03:35.870> it's<00:03:35.990> not<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:37.250> not<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.400> question<00:03:37.580> of

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
I think it's not it's not a question of

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.490 
I think it's not it's not a question of
the<00:03:38.840> owner<00:03:39.050> having<00:03:39.260> patience<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.710> think<00:03:41.500> we

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the owner having patience I think we

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.770 
the owner having patience I think we
have<00:03:42.620> set<00:03:43.250> out<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.700> build<00:03:43.820> something<00:03:44.480> new<00:03:44.510> at
