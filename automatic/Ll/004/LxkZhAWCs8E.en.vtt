color<00:00:12.349> when<00:00:12.709> working<00:00:12.889> with<00:00:13.159> watercolor<00:00:13.699> it's

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
color when working with watercolor it's

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.589 
color when working with watercolor it's
based<00:00:14.959> on<00:00:15.169> the<00:00:15.320> split<00:00:15.589> primary<00:00:16.039> principle

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
based on the split primary principle

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.259 
based on the split primary principle
I'll<00:00:17.599> talk<00:00:17.960> about<00:00:17.990> color<00:00:18.769> mixing<00:00:19.340> in<00:00:19.580> make

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
I'll talk about color mixing in make

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.810 
I'll talk about color mixing in make
that<00:00:20.509> pretty<00:00:20.750> simple<00:00:21.140> to<00:00:21.259> understand<00:00:21.830> I'll

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
that pretty simple to understand I'll

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
and you'll learn a formula for mixing

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.400 
and you'll learn a formula for mixing
color<00:00:28.249> and<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.029> formula<00:00:29.390> includes<00:00:29.720> no<00:00:30.079> more

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.820 

now<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.280> split<00:01:06.120> primary<00:01:06.960> color

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
now let's look at a split primary color

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.570 
now let's look at a split primary color
mixing<00:01:08.640> chart<00:01:09.030> we've<00:01:09.990> seen<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
mixing chart we've seen how to make the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.790 
mixing chart we've seen how to make the
primary<00:01:12.150> colors<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.840> secondaries<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
primary colors the secondaries and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.609 
primary colors the secondaries and
intermediates<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.270> let's<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.140> happens

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
intermediates now let's see what happens

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
intermediates now let's see what happens
when<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:16.979> mix<00:01:17.369> those<00:01:17.640> colors<00:01:18.030> together<00:01:18.300> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
when we mix those colors together and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.020 
when we mix those colors together and
find<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.800> range<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.520> different<00:01:20.670> colors

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
find out the range of different colors

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.690 
find out the range of different colors
we<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.390> create<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.220> our<00:01:23.369> charts

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
we can create this is what our charts

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
we can create this is what our charts
going<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:23.970> look<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.630> finish<00:01:24.990> with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
going to look like when we finish with

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.859 
going to look like when we finish with
it<00:01:26.690> we'll<00:01:27.690> start<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.440> by<00:01:29.340> making<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.479> grid<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
it we'll start out by making a grid of

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.160 
it we'll start out by making a grid of
nine<00:01:33.869> rows<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.940> ten<00:01:35.940> rows<00:01:36.180> across<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
nine rows down and ten rows across and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.040 
nine rows down and ten rows across and
if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.830> start<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.940> right<00:01:39.270> side<00:01:39.300> and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
if you start over on this right side and

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.639 
if you start over on this right side and
work<00:01:40.770> across<00:01:41.750> you'll<00:01:42.750> end<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.410> more

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
work across you'll end up with more

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.609 
work across you'll end up with more
space<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.500> we

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
space out here on the side that where we

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
space out here on the side that where we
will<00:01:46.710> pay<00:01:46.860> across<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.430> lines<00:01:47.640> you'll

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
will pay across the lines you'll

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
will pay across the lines you'll
understand<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.259> better<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> minute

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
understand that more better in a minute

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.050 
understand that more better in a minute
and<00:01:50.539> then<00:01:51.539> nine<00:01:52.050> rows<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and then nine rows down now I use a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.200 
and then nine rows down now I use a
ruler<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:57.080> hard<00:01:58.080> lead<00:01:58.289> pencil<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.100> like<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
ruler and a hard lead pencil I like to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.100 
ruler and a hard lead pencil I like to
use<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> hard<00:02:00.810> lead<00:02:00.990> pencil<00:02:01.440> because<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
use a hard lead pencil because it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.840 
use a hard lead pencil because it
doesn't<00:02:04.110> leave<00:02:04.259> us<00:02:04.289> much<00:02:04.560> graphite<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.549> smudge

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
doesn't leave us much graphite to smudge

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
doesn't leave us much graphite to smudge
and<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.780> easier<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.470> erase<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.100> our<00:02:08.250> light

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and it's easier to erase and our light

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.550 
and it's easier to erase and our light
touches<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.269> you<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.350> want

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
touches all that you need and you want

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.270 
touches all that you need and you want
to<00:02:10.649> leave<00:02:10.799> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.370> white<00:02:11.670> gap<00:02:12.450> between<00:02:13.410> your

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
to leave a little white gap between your

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.680 
to leave a little white gap between your
colors<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.790> erase<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.269> pencil

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
colors and when you erase that pencil

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.960 
colors and when you erase that pencil
line<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.500> gap<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.920> really<00:02:20.160> white<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.850> can

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
line that gap is really white so you can

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.420 
line that gap is really white so you can
really<00:02:21.380> distinguish<00:02:22.380> between<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.950> color<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
really distinguish between one color and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.360 
really distinguish between one color and
another<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.930> size<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> squares<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.220> your

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
another the size of the squares in your
