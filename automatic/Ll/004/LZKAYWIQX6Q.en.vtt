when the rocks are and in a way we do
get<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.460> sample<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.910> product<00:01:53.149> but<00:01:53.450> we're

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
get to sample the product but we're

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.260 
get to sample the product but we're
actually<00:01:53.780> sampling<00:01:54.500> where<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:55.880> the
