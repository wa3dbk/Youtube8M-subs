00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
sure nothing creases up to there I'm a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
sure nothing creases up to there I'm a
little<00:00:41.129> bit<00:00:41.460> extra<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.390> crease<00:00:42.750> because

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
little bit extra into my crease because

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
little bit extra into my crease because
that's<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.469> where<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> shadows<00:00:44.450> start<00:00:45.450> to

that's really where the shadows start to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
that's really where the shadows start to
just<00:00:45.780> integrate<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> take<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
just integrate and then when I take a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.920 
just integrate and then when I take a
little<00:00:47.579> bit<00:00:47.760> into<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.239> inner<00:00:48.450> corner<00:00:49.399> and
