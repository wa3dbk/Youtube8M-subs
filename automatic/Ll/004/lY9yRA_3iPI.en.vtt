think<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.850> right<00:04:09.910> now<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.940> clear<00:04:13.300> case

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
think of right now is it's a clear case

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.010 
think of right now is it's a clear case
and<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:15.640> really<00:04:15.700> not<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.150> case<00:04:16.510> is<00:04:16.690> like<00:04:16.840> you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
and it's really not a case is like you

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.140 
and it's really not a case is like you
put<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> little<00:04:17.830> coating<00:04:18.190> thing<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.850> and<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
put a little coating thing on it and it

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.510 
put a little coating thing on it and it
doesn't<00:04:19.479> add<00:04:19.630> any<00:04:19.870> bulk<00:04:19.960> to<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.710> I<00:04:21.310> already

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
doesn't add any bulk to it and I already

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.030
