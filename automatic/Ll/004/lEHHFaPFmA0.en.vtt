everybody<00:00:00.900> lawns<00:00:01.110> I've<00:00:01.350> been<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.740> with<00:00:01.920> a

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
everybody lawns I've been here with a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.649 
everybody lawns I've been here with a
review<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.490> Seagate's<00:00:02.970> new<00:00:03.210> desktop

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
review of Seagate's new desktop

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.780 
review of Seagate's new desktop
Thunderbolt<00:00:04.350> hard<00:00:04.620> drive<00:00:04.859> set<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
Thunderbolt hard drive set and it's a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.130 
Thunderbolt hard drive set and it's a
set<00:00:06.000> because<00:00:06.359> there's<00:00:06.509> actually<00:00:06.930> two

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
set because there's actually two

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.350 
set because there's actually two
distinct<00:00:07.680> pieces<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.120> comes

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
distinct pieces here that this comes

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.820 
distinct pieces here that this comes
with<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.780> I'll<00:00:09.840> describe<00:00:10.139> those<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.679> little

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
with and I'll describe those in a little

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.680 
with and I'll describe those in a little
bit<00:00:10.920> more<00:00:11.070> detail<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.550> minute<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.540> is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
bit more detail in a minute but this is

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.959 
bit more detail in a minute but this is
using<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.290> Thunderbolt<00:00:14.250> technology<00:00:14.400> which

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
using the Thunderbolt technology which

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.090 
using the Thunderbolt technology which
is<00:00:15.150> currently<00:00:15.809> found<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.379> Macintosh

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
is currently found on Macintosh

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.769 
is currently found on Macintosh
computers<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.850> newer<00:00:18.000> Macs

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
computers the newer Macs

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720 
computers the newer Macs
it's<00:00:19.199> also<00:00:19.350> making<00:00:19.650> its<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.010> onto<00:00:20.160> Windows<00:00:20.550> as

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
it's also making its way onto Windows as

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.849 
it's also making its way onto Windows as
well<00:00:20.970> Thunderbolt<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.689> very<00:00:22.109> high-speed

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
well Thunderbolt is a very high-speed

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.310 
well Thunderbolt is a very high-speed
data<00:00:23.760> transfer<00:00:24.240> protocol<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> lot<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:24.990> USB

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
data transfer protocol a lot like USB

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.700 
data transfer protocol a lot like USB
but<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.189> faster<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> back<00:00:28.410> it's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
but but faster so on the back it's

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.169 
but but faster so on the back it's
pretty<00:00:28.859> simple<00:00:29.279> there<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.429> two<00:00:29.640> Thunderbolt

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
pretty simple there are two Thunderbolt

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
pretty simple there are two Thunderbolt
ports<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.170> daisy<00:00:31.590> chaining<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
ports and this is for daisy chaining so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
ports and this is for daisy chaining so
when<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> plug<00:00:33.180> one<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.899> end<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
when you plug one in in one end into the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.020 
when you plug one in in one end into the
computer<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.219> continue<00:00:35.700> plugging

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
computer you can continue plugging

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840 
computer you can continue plugging
Thunderbolt<00:00:36.540> devices<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.620> an<00:00:38.070> achene<00:00:38.520> through

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
Thunderbolt devices in an achene through

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.510 
Thunderbolt devices in an achene through
this<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.739> machines<00:00:41.100> only<00:00:41.309> come

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this one here so some machines only come

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
this one here so some machines only come
with<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:41.910> Thunderbolt<00:00:42.450> port<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.200> will

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
with one Thunderbolt port so this will

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
with one Thunderbolt port so this will
give<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> ability<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.160> keep<00:00:44.489> extending

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
give you the ability to keep extending

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
give you the ability to keep extending
that<00:00:45.420> port<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.780> well<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.140> does<00:00:46.320> require<00:00:46.680> power

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that port as well it does require power

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.389 
that port as well it does require power
from<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.149> wall<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
from your wall so it's not like the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
from your wall so it's not like the
mobile<00:00:51.000> version<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.600> product<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.960> they

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
mobile version of this product that they

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.979 
mobile version of this product that they
had<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.710> earlier<00:00:53.219> last<00:00:53.550> year<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> need

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
had out earlier last year so you do need

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
had out earlier last year so you do need
to<00:00:55.050> plug<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> reason<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
to plug it in and the reason is is that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
to plug it in and the reason is is that
this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> using<00:00:57.090> desktop<00:00:57.629> hard<00:00:57.840> drives<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this is using desktop hard drives the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
this is using desktop hard drives the

comes<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.280> Thunderbolt<00:01:12.000> cable<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
comes with a Thunderbolt cable and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.179 
comes with a Thunderbolt cable and
that's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.799> some

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that's not something that some

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
that's not something that some
Thunderbolt<00:01:14.729> devices<00:01:15.000> come<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
Thunderbolt devices come with and in

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
Thunderbolt devices come with and in
fact<00:01:15.869> those<00:01:16.259> cables<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.770> often<00:01:17.009> run<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.400> 50

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
fact those cables can often run about 50

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.170 
fact those cables can often run about 50
dollars

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
dollars

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
dollars
so<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:19.080> plug<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.680> some

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so let's plug it in and do some

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
so let's plug it in and do some
benchmarks<00:01:20.270> okay<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.330> we've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
benchmarks okay so we've got the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.660 
benchmarks okay so we've got the
Thunderbolt<00:01:22.740> cable<00:01:23.040> plugged<00:01:23.280> into<00:01:23.490> our

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
Thunderbolt cable plugged into our

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.030 
Thunderbolt cable plugged into our
macbook<00:01:24.240> pro<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.570> we're<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> run<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
macbook pro and we're going to run a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
macbook pro and we're going to run a
test<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.580> love<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> test<00:01:27.479> from<00:01:27.720> Blackmagic

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
test I love this test from Blackmagic

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
test I love this test from Blackmagic
this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> video<00:01:29.070> test<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.750> basically

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this is a video test and it basically

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
this is a video test and it basically
says<00:01:31.439> how<00:01:31.619> fast<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.340> write<00:01:32.759> read<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
says how fast you can write read and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 
says how fast you can write read and
write<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> drive<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> recording<00:01:34.680> video

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
write from the drive for recording video

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
write from the drive for recording video
so<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.939> built-in<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.600> terabyte<00:01:36.960> drive

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so the built-in three terabyte drive

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
so the built-in three terabyte drive

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
does about 146 megabytes per second and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.429 
does about 146 megabytes per second and
write<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.030> 160<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> read<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:42.930> really

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
write in 160 and read which is really

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:43.819 
write in 160 and read which is really
pretty

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
pretty

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
pretty
pretty<00:01:44.130> darn<00:01:44.310> fast<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.600> longer<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> runs

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pretty darn fast and the longer it runs

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289 
pretty darn fast and the longer it runs
the<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.920> able<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.210> bit

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the more it's able to get a little bit

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.730 
the more it's able to get a little bit
more<00:01:48.420> speed<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.500> pretty

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
more speed out of there so it's pretty

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.880 
more speed out of there so it's pretty
impressive<00:01:50.070> speed<00:01:50.909> wise<00:01:51.200> certainly<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
impressive speed wise certainly up there

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
impressive speed wise certainly up there

on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> Mac<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.049> something

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
on the Mac here but there is something

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.980 
on the Mac here but there is something
interesting<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.250> occur<00:01:59.579> when<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.479> take

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
interesting that can occur when you take

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690 
interesting that can occur when you take
this<00:02:01.170> thing<00:02:01.229> apart<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.009> let's<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> real

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this thing apart so let's do that real

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.859 
this thing apart so let's do that real
quick<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> I'll<00:02:03.149> show<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.329> something<00:02:03.659> else

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
quick and I'll show you something else

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
quick and I'll show you something else
that's<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.259> neat<00:02:04.409> about<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.740> product

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that's kind of neat about this product

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
that's kind of neat about this product
so<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.420> kit<00:02:06.689> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so what I really like about this kit is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.109 
so what I really like about this kit is
that<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.170> drive<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> separate<00:02:08.520> unit<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.030> it

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that the drive is a separate unit and it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.820 
that the drive is a separate unit and it
comes<00:02:09.360> apart<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.349> doesn't<00:02:10.500> come<00:02:10.739> out

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
comes apart so you it doesn't come out

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.880 
comes apart so you it doesn't come out
easily<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.510> pull<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.959> drive<00:02:13.260> out

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
easily but you can pull this drive out

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
easily but you can pull this drive out
and<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.670> again<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> 3<00:02:15.360> terabyte<00:02:15.569> unit

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and this is a again the 3 terabyte unit

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.809 
and this is a again the 3 terabyte unit
you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.620> buy<00:02:16.740> another<00:02:17.040> one<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.340> these<00:02:17.460> and

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
you can buy another one of these and

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.940 
you can buy another one of these and
just<00:02:17.940> pop<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.600> there<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.990> have<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> backup

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
just pop it in there and have a backup

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.590 
just pop it in there and have a backup
that<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.430> bring<00:02:20.700> back<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.120> forth<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
that you can bring back and forth to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.720 
that you can bring back and forth to
your<00:02:21.630> office<00:02:22.080> or<00:02:22.200> some<00:02:22.410> place<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.800> get<00:02:22.980> your

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
your office or some place to get your

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.940 
your office or some place to get your
your<00:02:24.060> data<00:02:24.540> off-site<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.590> actually<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
your data off-site which is actually a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
your data off-site which is actually a
very<00:02:26.040> important<00:02:26.700> part<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.030> backing<00:02:27.420> up

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
very important part of backing up

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.059 
very important part of backing up
properly<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.319> your<00:02:28.440> data<00:02:28.590> off-site

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
properly is to get your data off-site

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.830 
properly is to get your data off-site
but<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:29.910> thing<00:02:30.060> you'll<00:02:30.180> notice<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.660> when

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
but one thing you'll notice is that when

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.810 
but one thing you'll notice is that when
you<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.050> pull<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> drive<00:02:31.590> off<00:02:31.830> you're<00:02:32.640> left

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
you do pull the drive off you're left

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.060 
you do pull the drive off you're left
with<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> SATA<00:02:33.690> connector<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> standard

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.600 
hard drive now uses and the significance
of<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.950> necessarily

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
of this is that you don't necessarily

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.410 
of this is that you don't necessarily
need<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> buy<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.350> these<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.920> get<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.819> hard

around but if you're able to keep the
drive<00:03:09.690> steady<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.860> especially<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
drive steady and especially with a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.650 
drive steady and especially with a
solid-state<00:03:11.850> drive<00:03:12.120> from<00:03:12.300> those<00:03:12.390> moving

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
solid-state drive from those moving

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.870 
solid-state drive from those moving
parts<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:13.950> do<00:03:14.070> really<00:03:14.370> well<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
parts you can do really well and the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.880 
parts you can do really well and the
performance<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.570> remarkable<00:03:16.440> certainly<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
performance is remarkable certainly a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.220 
performance is remarkable certainly a
lot<00:03:17.160> faster<00:03:17.670> than<00:03:17.820> what<00:03:18.000> I've<00:03:18.090> seen<00:03:18.360> plugging

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
lot faster than what I've seen plugging

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.650 
lot faster than what I've seen plugging
the<00:03:19.350> same<00:03:19.560> drive<00:03:19.829> into<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> USB<00:03:20.549> 3.0<00:03:21.299> enclosure

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the same drive into a USB 3.0 enclosure

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.360 
the same drive into a USB 3.0 enclosure
so<00:03:22.019> let's<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.620> look<00:03:22.739> at<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> benchmark

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
so let's have a look at the benchmark

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.830 
so let's have a look at the benchmark
and<00:03:23.489> you'll<00:03:23.610> see<00:03:23.760> what<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:23.910> mean<00:03:23.970> now<00:03:24.329> what's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and you'll see what I mean now what's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.569 
and you'll see what I mean now what's
amazing<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.470> solid-state<00:03:26.130> drive<00:03:26.160> is

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
amazing is when a solid-state drive is

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.120 
amazing is when a solid-state drive is
put<00:03:26.760> into<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.060> device<00:03:27.390> how<00:03:27.690> much<00:03:27.870> faster<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
put into this device how much faster it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.979 
put into this device how much faster it
is<00:03:29.400> now<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> mostly<00:03:30.630> due<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
is now this is mostly due to the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.539 
is now this is mostly due to the
solid-state<00:03:31.500> drive<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:31.950> really<00:03:32.130> no<00:03:32.220> fault

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
solid-state drive it's really no fault

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.069 
solid-state drive it's really no fault
of<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.820> spinning<00:03:33.120> drive<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.750> comes<00:03:33.959> with

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
of the spinning drive that it comes with

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.870 
of the spinning drive that it comes with
it's<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> nature<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.160> how<00:03:35.340> these<00:03:35.519> discs

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it's just the nature of how these discs

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's just the nature of how these discs
work<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.989> can<00:03:37.140> see<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.560> how<00:03:37.920> fast<00:03:38.370> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
work but you can see just how fast you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.750 
work but you can see just how fast you
can<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:40.049> external<00:03:40.769> device<00:03:41.100> up<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.370> with

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
can get this external device up to with

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.880 
can get this external device up to with
Thunderbolt<00:03:42.200> certainly<00:03:43.200> not<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.530> most<00:03:43.680> ideal

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
Thunderbolt certainly not the most ideal

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.949 
Thunderbolt certainly not the most ideal
fit<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.329> be<00:03:45.390> careful<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
fit and you want to be careful not to

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.690 
fit and you want to be careful not to
knock<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:46.530> around<00:03:46.890> or<00:03:47.040> anything<00:03:47.190> else<00:03:47.489> like

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
knock this around or anything else like

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.330 
knock this around or anything else like
that<00:03:47.730> but<00:03:48.630> if<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.780> have<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.440> lot<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.829> video<00:03:50.130> work

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
that but if you have a lot of video work

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
that but if you have a lot of video work
that<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.610> do<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:50.910> things<00:03:51.120> where<00:03:51.269> you're

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
that you do or things where you're

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.110 
that you do or things where you're
actively<00:03:51.900> swapping<00:03:52.410> drives<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.970> can

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
actively swapping drives out and you can

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360 
actively swapping drives out and you can
keep<00:03:54.329> your<00:03:54.510> desk<00:03:54.780> very<00:03:55.079> stable<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.250> a
