00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.990 
come and Lewis had to cut back to the
inside<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.650> as<00:03:46.769> he<00:03:46.950> does<00:03:47.189> watch<00:03:47.579> his<00:03:47.760> front

wheel<00:03:48.150> hit<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.569> curve<00:03:48.840> lifts<00:03:49.470> him<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
wheel hit that curve lifts him up a

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.770 
wheel hit that curve lifts him up a
little<00:03:49.920> bit<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.280> at<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.849> same<00:03:51.060> time<00:03:51.299> Morton's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
little bit and at the same time Morton's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.869 
little bit and at the same time Morton's
turned<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.170> left<00:03:52.349> that's<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.099> pretty<00:03:53.340> hard<00:03:53.670> one

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
turned and left that's a pretty hard one

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.250 
turned and left that's a pretty hard one
to<00:03:54.060> call<00:03:54.269> because<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.629> think<00:03:54.690> Morton<00:03:55.199> was

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
to call because I think Morton was

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.289 
to call because I think Morton was
trying<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.650> hold<00:03:55.859> them<00:03:56.069> off<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.519> as<00:03:57.000> he<00:03:57.120> goes

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
trying to hold them off but as he goes

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.000 
trying to hold them off but as he goes
by<00:03:57.540> right<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:57.930> they<00:03:58.079> just<00:03:58.260> kind<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.590> tangled

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
by right here they just kind of tangled

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.860 
by right here they just kind of tangled
boy<00:03:59.549> it's<00:03:59.699> a<00:03:59.790> tough<00:04:00.030> one<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.389> tricky

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
boy it's a tough one it's tricky

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.330 
boy it's a tough one it's tricky
conditions<00:04:01.379> out<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:01.889> think<00:04:01.949> if<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
conditions out there and I think if the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.680 
conditions out there and I think if the
track<00:04:02.579> wouldn't<00:04:02.910> be<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.150> slippery

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
track wouldn't be so slippery

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.330 
track wouldn't be so slippery
Morton<00:04:04.319> might've<00:04:04.650> been<00:04:04.709> able<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.980> keep<00:04:05.160> that

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
Morton might've been able to keep that

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.250 
Morton might've been able to keep that
up<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.730> as<00:04:05.849> he<00:04:05.879> lifts<00:04:06.209> his<00:04:06.269> leg<00:04:06.329> up<00:04:06.750> he<00:04:07.079> gets

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
up and as he lifts his leg up he gets

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.689 
up and as he lifts his leg up he gets
pushed<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.709> other<00:04:07.739> bike<00:04:08.069> just<00:04:08.280> gets<00:04:08.489> pushed

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
pushed the other bike just gets pushed

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.460 
pushed the other bike just gets pushed
over<00:04:08.940> if<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.690> track<00:04:09.900> had<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> little<00:04:10.290> bit<00:04:10.440> more

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
over if the track had a little bit more

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.780 
over if the track had a little bit more
grip<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.980> don't<00:04:11.129> think<00:04:11.310> he<00:04:11.400> would<00:04:11.549> have<00:04:11.579> went

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
grip I don't think he would have went

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.740 
grip I don't think he would have went
down

and all the pressure now on Simon we get
a<00:05:04.830> close<00:05:05.039> shot<00:05:05.070> what<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:05.729> think<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.030> this

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
a close shot what do you think of this

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.340 
a close shot what do you think of this
new<00:05:06.300> device<00:05:06.539> they're<00:05:06.780> wearing<00:05:07.020> on<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.199> neck

new device they're wearing on the neck

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.790 
new device they're wearing on the neck
I'm<00:05:08.220> interested<00:05:09.180> in<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.870> because<00:05:10.289> there's<00:05:10.620> no

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
I'm interested in it because there's no

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680 
I'm interested in it because there's no
question<00:05:11.070> if<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:11.520> have<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.729> head-on<00:05:12.210> collision

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
question if you have a head-on collision

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.930 
question if you have a head-on collision
with<00:05:12.990> your<00:05:13.199> head<00:05:13.440> on<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.740> top<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.490> course<00:05:14.789> it

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
with your head on the top of course it

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.760 
with your head on the top of course it
stops<00:05:15.240> that<00:05:15.479> compression<00:05:15.930> down<00:05:16.289> through<00:05:16.620> your

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
stops that compression down through your

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.159 
stops that compression down through your
spine<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.850> save<00:05:18.180> your<00:05:18.720> disk<00:05:18.960> or

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
spine and can save your disk or

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.710 
spine and can save your disk or
potential<00:05:19.770> paralysis<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:21.030> think<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:21.539> an

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
potential paralysis so I think it's an

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.770 
potential paralysis so I think it's an
interesting<00:05:22.160> concept<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.760> course<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.270> didn't

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
interesting concept of course I didn't

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.110 
interesting concept of course I didn't
ride<00:05:24.960> with<00:05:25.199> one<00:05:25.380> myself<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.190> hope<00:05:26.669> that<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.060> you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
ride with one myself I hope that so you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.969 
ride with one myself I hope that so you
can<00:05:27.419> actually<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:28.110> know<00:05:28.169> move<00:05:28.500> around<00:05:28.650> with

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
can actually you know move around with

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.620 
can actually you know move around with
it<00:05:29.100> but<00:05:29.130> certainly<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.639> think<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.970> it's<00:05:30.539> an

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
it but certainly I think that it's an

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.520 
it but certainly I think that it's an
interesting<00:05:30.930> idea

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
interesting idea

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.560 
interesting idea
okay<00:05:32.520> well<00:05:32.669> as<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:32.850> can<00:05:32.940> see<00:05:33.000> they<00:05:33.210> are<00:05:33.240> back

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
okay well as you can see they are back

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.810 
okay well as you can see they are back
