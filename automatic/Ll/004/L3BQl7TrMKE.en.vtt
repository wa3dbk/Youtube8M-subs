00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
specs that are important I think is that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.710 
specs that are important I think is that
it's<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.780> 4G<00:01:07.229> phone<00:01:07.850> quad-core<00:01:09.320> 1.3<00:01:10.320> gigahertz

it's a 4G phone quad-core 1.3 gigahertz

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.730

it<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:12.900> has<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> 6<00:01:13.530> inch<00:01:13.770> screen<00:01:14.869> get<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> 6.0

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it also has a 6 inch screen get it 6.0

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
it also has a 6 inch screen get it 6.0
yeah<00:01:19.250> 8.0<00:01:20.330> megapixel<00:01:21.330> camera<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.950> back

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
yeah 8.0 megapixel camera in the back

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
yeah 8.0 megapixel camera in the back
which<00:01:23.430> isn't<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.150> great<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.869> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
which isn't that great we all know but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
which isn't that great we all know but
that's<00:01:25.439> kind<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.790> think<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.900> far

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's kind of where this I think so far

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.219 
that's kind of where this I think so far
is<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.430> where<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.939> phone<00:01:30.210> wax<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
is kind of where this phone wax for the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
is kind of where this phone wax for the
price<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> camera<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
price is just the camera I think the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.319 
price is just the camera I think the
other<00:01:33.329> specs<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.900> pretty<00:01:34.110> decent<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.220> yeah<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
other specs are pretty decent but yeah a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.440 
other specs are pretty decent but yeah a
2.0<00:01:37.259> megapixel<00:01:38.100> front<00:01:38.610> camera<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> all

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
2.0 megapixel front camera which we all

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
2.0 megapixel front camera which we all
know<00:01:39.600> isn't<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> great<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.680> mean<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
know isn't that great but I mean it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.780 
know isn't that great but I mean it
takes<00:01:41.460> pictures<00:01:42.500> 1<00:01:43.500> gigabyte<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.100> RAM<00:01:44.430> which

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
takes pictures 1 gigabyte of RAM which

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
takes pictures 1 gigabyte of RAM which
still<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> low<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> mean<00:01:46.799> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
still is kind of low but I mean that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
still is kind of low but I mean that's
fine<00:01:47.189> considering<00:01:47.790> its<00:01:48.030> price<00:01:48.090> point<00:01:48.630> that's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
fine considering its price point that's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.170 
fine considering its price point that's
completely<00:01:49.649> expected<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.460> expandable

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
completely expected it's expandable

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
completely expected it's expandable
