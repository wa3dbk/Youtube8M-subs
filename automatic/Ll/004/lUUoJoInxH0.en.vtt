though the watching mechanize assumed to
be<00:00:48.399> totally<00:00:49.030> operational<00:00:49.630> I<00:00:49.660> just<00:00:49.809> have<00:00:49.899> to<00:00:49.930> do

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.380 
be totally operational I just have to do
the<00:00:50.170> steering<00:00:50.410> now<00:00:50.620> oh<00:00:50.880> I'm<00:00:51.880> so<00:00:52.090> glad<00:00:52.270> that

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the steering now oh I'm so glad that

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.229 
the steering now oh I'm so glad that
didn't<00:00:52.750> break<00:00:52.899> nothing<00:00:53.230> broke<00:00:53.590> oh<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:54.399> the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
didn't break nothing broke oh so the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.130 
didn't break nothing broke oh so the
reason<00:00:55.360> I<00:00:55.510> wanted<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.780> get<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.960> weight<00:00:56.110> off

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
reason I wanted to get the weight off

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.170 
reason I wanted to get the weight off
those<00:00:56.559> three<00:00:56.800> legs<00:00:57.040> is<00:00:57.309> so<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:57.640> could<00:00:57.910> take

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
those three legs is so I could take

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.520 
those three legs is so I could take
these<00:00:58.329> things<00:00:58.570> off<00:00:58.840> because<00:00:59.050> i<00:00:59.200> can't<00:00:59.410> really

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
these things off because i can't really

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.549 
these things off because i can't really
disconnect<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.250> joint<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.670> weight<00:01:00.910> on<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.559> so

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
disconnect the joint and weight on it so

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.219 
disconnect the joint and weight on it so
there<00:01:02.829> that's<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.280> without<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.730> thingy<00:01:04.229> I've

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
there that's it without the thingy I've

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.370 
there that's it without the thingy I've
got<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.409> bit<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.680> extra<00:01:06.040> axle<00:01:06.549> sticking<00:01:07.090> out<00:01:07.380> but
