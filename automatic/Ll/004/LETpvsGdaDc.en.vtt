machine I'm sure you know what sugar
crashes<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.990> know<00:00:10.170> you've<00:00:10.440> had<00:00:10.590> something<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
an hour later you just get really

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.060 
an hour later you just get really
lethargic<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> get<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.350> tired<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
lethargic and you get really tired and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.880 
lethargic and you get really tired and
you<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> sleep<00:00:18.690> there's<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.650> food

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you just want to sleep there's a food

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.330 
you just want to sleep there's a food
crash<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.460> sugar<00:00:20.640> crash<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
crash that's a sugar crash and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.420 
crash that's a sugar crash and
essentially<00:00:23.340> there's<00:00:23.609> loads<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> foods<00:00:24.330> that

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
essentially there's loads of foods that

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.830 
essentially there's loads of foods that
you<00:00:26.430> could<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.760> cheesin<00:00:27.180> differently<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you could be cheesin differently you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.300 
you could be cheesin differently you
could<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> same<00:00:28.320> food<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:29.220> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
could have the same food just a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.130 
could have the same food just a
different<00:00:29.670> brand<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.150> different<00:00:30.420> make<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
different brand or different make that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
different brand or different make that
will<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.460> stop<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.790> happening

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
will actually stop that from happening

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.660 
will actually stop that from happening
and<00:00:34.100> essentially<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.309> need<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and essentially what you need to do is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.600 
and essentially what you need to do is
you<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> keep<00:00:36.420> your<00:00:37.050> sugar<00:00:37.380> levels<00:00:37.770> low<00:00:38.040> now

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you to keep your sugar levels low now

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
you to keep your sugar levels low now
when<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.940> sugar<00:00:39.270> levels<00:00:39.629> spike<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.620> you've

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
when your sugar levels spike and you've

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
when your sugar levels spike and you've
had<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.790> those<00:00:41.910> things<00:00:42.239> that's<00:00:42.719> sugar<00:00:43.020> crush

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
had all those things that's sugar crush

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
had all those things that's sugar crush
that<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> sugar<00:00:44.160> crash<00:00:44.399> comes<00:00:44.700> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that when that sugar crash comes down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.139 
that when that sugar crash comes down
your<00:00:46.079> metabolism<00:00:46.260> slows<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:48.000> your

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
your metabolism slows down with your

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.670 
your metabolism slows down with your
body<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> difference<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> your

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
body but the difference is your

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
body but the difference is your
metabolism<00:00:50.219> might<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.610> speed<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.360> quickly

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
metabolism might not speed up as quickly

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
metabolism might not speed up as quickly
as<00:00:52.260> you'd<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.090> essentially

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
as you'd like it and so essentially

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
as you'd like it and so essentially
you're<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.170> digesting<00:00:55.710> foods<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.250> you're

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you're not digesting foods and you're

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
you're not digesting foods and you're
not<00:00:56.730> processing<00:00:57.239> funds<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.960> quickly<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not processing funds as quickly as you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
not processing funds as quickly as you
were<00:00:58.890> before<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.609> had<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.879> sugar<00:01:00.149> crash<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
were before you had that sugar crash so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
were before you had that sugar crash so
essentially<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.910> check<00:01:03.390> your

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
essentially one go see it check your

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.399 
essentially one go see it check your
labels<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.339> I've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.060> walnuts<00:01:06.409> walnuts

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
labels and I've got some walnuts walnuts

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.210 
labels and I've got some walnuts walnuts
here<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.770> knots<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.260> 0.7<00:01:10.260> grams<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.740> sugar<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
here so knots and 0.7 grams of sugar and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
here so knots and 0.7 grams of sugar and
that's<00:01:11.369> only<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.760> percent<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.840> daily

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that's only one percent of your daily

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
that's only one percent of your daily
guideline<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.119> said<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.920> m-my<00:01:16.920> breakfast<00:01:17.400> will

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
guideline I said my m-my breakfast will

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.350 
guideline I said my m-my breakfast will
be<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.780> 7<00:01:19.619> grams<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.250> sugar<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.759> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
be about 7 grams of sugar and that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
be about 7 grams of sugar and that's
only<00:01:21.540> maybe<00:01:21.810> eight<00:01:22.170> percent<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.189> daily

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
only maybe eight percent of my daily

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
only maybe eight percent of my daily
guideline<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.689> try<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.320> no<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:26.159> than

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
guideline and I try to have no more than

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.469 
guideline and I try to have no more than
fifteen<00:01:27.470> percent<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:29.369> daily<00:01:29.610> allowance<00:01:30.210> in

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
fifteen percent of my daily allowance in

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
fifteen percent of my daily allowance in
my<00:01:30.750> main<00:01:30.960> meals<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.530> night<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.880> that's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
my main meals at night and so that's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.630 
my main meals at night and so that's
walnut<00:01:33.299> heart<00:01:33.600> still<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.229> really<00:01:34.560> low<00:01:34.740> 0.7

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
walnut heart still really really low 0.7

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.350 
walnut heart still really really low 0.7
grams<00:01:36.259> really<00:01:37.259> healthy<00:01:37.560> foods<00:01:38.360> tomatoes

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
grams really healthy foods tomatoes

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.810 
grams really healthy foods tomatoes
chopped<00:01:39.930> tomatoes<00:01:40.320> sugars<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.220> only<00:01:41.490> three

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
chopped tomatoes sugars are only three

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
chopped tomatoes sugars are only three
point<00:01:42.060> seven<00:01:42.210> grams<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.750> chopped<00:01:43.290> tomatoes

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
point seven grams in chopped tomatoes

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.140 
point seven grams in chopped tomatoes
and

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.600 
and
so<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.530> low<00:01:46.800> but<00:01:47.460> then

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so they're really really low but then

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.950 
so they're really really low but then
like<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.360> said<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.780> breakfast<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.960> over

to this cause Nutella sugar crash might

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.949 
to this cause Nutella sugar crash might
just<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.450> you're<00:02:57.540> drinking<00:02:57.660> without

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
food and so this was so important that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
food and so this was so important that
you<00:03:00.750> check<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.680> sugar<00:03:01.950> levels<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:04.190> sometimes

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you check the sugar levels and sometimes

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.509 
you check the sugar levels and sometimes
now<00:03:05.900> yes<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.350> might<00:03:07.530> think<00:03:07.739> its<00:03:07.980> fruit<00:03:08.280> it's

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
now yes you might think its fruit it's

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.570 
now yes you might think its fruit it's
healthy<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.090> an<00:03:09.950> actual<00:03:10.950> fact<00:03:11.220> especially
