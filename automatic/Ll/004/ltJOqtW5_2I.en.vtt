00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.830 

a<00:04:50.320> good<00:04:50.890> thing<00:04:51.070> i<00:04:51.190> centered<00:04:51.670> us<00:04:51.880> in<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.330> past

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
a good thing i centered us in the past

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.990 
a good thing i centered us in the past
before<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.710> engine<00:04:54.010> started<00:04:54.430> giving<00:04:54.730> us<00:04:54.820> in

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
before the engine started giving us in

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.839 
before the engine started giving us in
trouble

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.309 

I'm<00:05:00.270> not<00:05:00.389> going<00:05:00.569> to<00:05:00.629> try<00:05:00.779> and<00:05:00.809> do<00:05:00.990> anything

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
I'm not going to try and do anything

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.899 
I'm not going to try and do anything
about<00:05:01.439> it<00:05:01.589> now<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:02.129> once<00:05:02.309> we<00:05:02.429> get<00:05:02.580> out<00:05:02.729> into

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
about it now but once we get out into

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.559 
about it now but once we get out into
the<00:05:02.999> straight<00:05:03.389> into<00:05:03.659> open<00:05:03.929> water<00:05:05.419> we'll<00:05:06.419> take

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
the straight into open water we'll take

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.350 
the straight into open water we'll take
a<00:05:06.629> look<00:05:06.839> at<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.080> water<00:05:07.259> separator

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
a look at the water separator

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.209 
a look at the water separator
probably<00:05:10.229> shouldn't<00:05:10.560> drain<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.039> water

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
probably shouldn't drain the water

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.730 
probably shouldn't drain the water
separator<00:05:12.000> pole<00:05:12.300> or<00:05:12.750> we<00:05:12.960> started<00:05:13.379> office

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
separator pole or we started office

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:29.100 
separator pole or we started office
morning

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.360 

now<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.560> engine<00:05:29.920> finally<00:05:30.280> quit<00:05:30.550> on<00:05:30.730> us

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
now the engine finally quit on us

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.090 
now the engine finally quit on us
so<00:05:32.790> we<00:05:32.940> stop<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.449> walk<00:05:33.630> around<00:05:33.990> for<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.229> moment

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.010 

decided<00:05:37.910> that<00:05:38.060> we<00:05:38.150> probably<00:05:38.360> had<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.720> fuel

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
decided that we probably had a fuel

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.110 
decided that we probably had a fuel
problem<00:05:39.260> so

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
problem so

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.050 
problem so
we<00:05:41.180> opened<00:05:41.479> our<00:05:41.630> access<00:05:42.320> hatch

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
we opened our access hatch

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.590 
we opened our access hatch
water<00:05:44.660> separator<00:05:45.230> filter

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
water separator filter

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.020 
water separator filter
and<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.080> engine<00:05:47.350> hatch<00:05:47.500> on<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.800> inside<00:05:48.160> Laura

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
and the engine hatch on the inside Laura

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.240 
and the engine hatch on the inside Laura
got<00:05:49.240> our<00:05:49.390> wrench<00:05:49.660> out<00:05:49.900> and<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:50.860> bled<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
got our wrench out and we bled the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.940 
got our wrench out and we bled the
injectors<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:51.790> fuel<00:05:52.000> line

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
injectors and fuel line

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.060 
injectors and fuel line
this<00:05:54.430> was<00:05:54.610> made<00:05:54.820> much<00:05:55.030> easier<00:05:55.330> for<00:05:55.690> us

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
this was made much easier for us

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.700 
this was made much easier for us
by<00:05:57.640> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
by the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
convenience that we put in a access

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.360 
convenience that we put in a access
hatch<00:06:01.830> in<00:06:02.490> cockpit<00:06:02.940> soul

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370

we<00:06:04.550> can<00:06:04.729> reach<00:06:04.940> the

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
we can reach the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.470 
we can reach the
