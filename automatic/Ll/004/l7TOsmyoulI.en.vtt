asking the answers make sense but when

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.900 
asking the answers make sense but when
you're<00:00:59.560> trying<00:00:59.740> to<00:00:59.860> cram<00:01:00.160> answers<00:01:00.700> into

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
you're trying to cram answers into

you're trying to cram answers into

people's heads who aren't asking the
questions<00:01:03.550> when<00:01:03.730> you<00:01:03.910> give<00:01:04.089> answers<00:01:04.600> before

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
questions when you give answers before

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.840 
questions when you give answers before
the<00:01:05.049> question<00:01:05.470> is<00:01:05.590> ripe<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.340> answer<00:01:06.640> doesn't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
the question is ripe the answer doesn't

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.399 
the question is ripe the answer doesn't
make<00:01:07.090> any<00:01:07.270> sense<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:07.659> then<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.110> becomes

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
make any sense so then it just becomes

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.100 
make any sense so then it just becomes
this<00:01:08.590> memorization<00:01:09.430> process<00:01:09.939> his<00:01:10.479> philosophy

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
this memorization process his philosophy

this memorization process his philosophy
was<00:01:11.140> when<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> children<00:01:12.310> asked<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.030> read

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
was when the children asked to read

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.789 
was when the children asked to read
that's<00:01:13.450> when<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.930> provide<00:01:14.320> them<00:01:14.530> with<00:01:14.650> the

that's when you provide them with the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's when you provide them with the
opportunity<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.430> read<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.000> until<00:01:16.570> they<00:01:16.720> ask

the carrots in other words you leave the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.120 
the carrots in other words you leave the
children<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.780> be<00:01:31.929> inspired<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.829> their<00:01:32.979> own

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130

and<00:01:38.140> learn<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.740> read<00:01:38.890> early<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:39.789> he<00:01:40.119> was

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
and learn to read early and so he was

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760 
and learn to read early and so he was
very<00:01:40.299> happy<00:01:40.840> all<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.170> system<00:01:41.499> is<00:01:41.590> really
