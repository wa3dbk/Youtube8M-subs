shapes which iphone it's this way to do

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
shapes which iphone it's this way to do
my<00:00:36.960> eyebrows<00:00:37.410> rather<00:00:37.739> than<00:00:37.920> trying<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
my eyebrows rather than trying to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
my eyebrows rather than trying to
completely<00:00:38.940> change<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.570> shape<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
completely change the shape I have a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.400 
completely change the shape I have a
very<00:00:41.070> big<00:00:41.610> gap<00:00:41.940> between<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.480> brows<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> eyes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very big gap between my brows and eyes

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
very big gap between my brows and eyes
so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> found<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> can't<00:00:44.910> draw<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> arch

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so I found that I can't draw the arch

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
so I found that I can't draw the arch
too<00:00:45.809> high<00:00:46.079> otherwise<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.340> make<00:00:47.520> me<00:00:47.670> look

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
too high otherwise it will make me look

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
too high otherwise it will make me look
like<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.300> surprised<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> time<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
like I'm surprised all the time which is

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:08.450 
like I'm surprised all the time which is
not<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.660> hot<00:00:51.870> luck

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.160 

also<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.520> can<00:01:09.729> see<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.299> I<00:01:10.329> have<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.570> wide<00:01:10.869> gap

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
also you can see that I have a wide gap

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.260 
also you can see that I have a wide gap
between<00:01:11.350> my<00:01:11.740> eyebrows<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.460> I'm<00:01:12.670> filling<00:01:13.060> in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
between my eyebrows so I'm filling in

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.120 
between my eyebrows so I'm filling in
the<00:01:13.420> inner<00:01:13.630> part<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:14.020> my<00:01:14.229> brows<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:14.619> little<00:01:14.979> bit

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the inner part of my brows a little bit

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.620 
the inner part of my brows a little bit
so<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.310> they're<00:01:15.610> going<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.970> be<00:01:16.119> more<00:01:16.360> close

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
so that they're going to be more close

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.840 
so that they're going to be more close
together<00:01:16.840> I<00:01:17.259> like<00:01:17.829> to<00:01:17.860> draw<00:01:18.159> them<00:01:18.310> upward

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
together I like to draw them upward

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.760 
together I like to draw them upward
almost<00:01:19.360> like<00:01:19.509> drawing<00:01:19.840> false<00:01:20.170> here<00:01:20.530> which

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
almost like drawing false here which

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.709 
almost like drawing false here which
blends<00:01:21.189> more<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:21.729> gives<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.119> natural<00:01:22.509> finish

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
blends more and gives the natural finish

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:32.330 
blends more and gives the natural finish
to<00:01:22.929> my<00:01:23.049> eyebrows<00:01:23.469> later<00:01:23.890> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.860 

once<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.490> am<00:01:33.610> happy<00:01:33.820> with<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.210> shapes<00:01:34.450> i'm

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870
