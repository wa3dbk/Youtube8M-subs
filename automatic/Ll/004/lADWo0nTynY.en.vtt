by<00:06:00.350> judgment<00:06:00.800> on<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:01.669> next<00:06:02.060> target<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:02.750> use

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
by judgment on the next target you use

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.570 
by judgment on the next target you use
it<00:06:03.140> on<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.560> has<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.740> be<00:06:03.980> a<00:06:04.010> second<00:06:04.400> target

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
it on and it has to be a second target

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.300 
it on and it has to be a second target
by<00:06:05.030> twenty<00:06:05.300> percent<00:06:05.600> so<00:06:06.560> it's<00:06:06.770> very<00:06:06.950> simple<00:06:07.160> to

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
by twenty percent so it's very simple to

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.670 
by twenty percent so it's very simple to
use<00:06:07.370> this<00:06:07.610> if<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.270> are<00:06:08.690> going<00:06:08.900> for<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.350> kill<00:06:09.620> and

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
use this if you are going for a kill and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.440 
use this if you are going for a kill and
you<00:06:10.130> need<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.400> use<00:06:10.520> judgment<00:06:10.970> to<00:06:11.060> get<00:06:11.180> a<00:06:11.210> kill

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
you need to use judgment to get a kill

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.420 
you need to use judgment to get a kill
you<00:06:12.110> judgment<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.770> target<00:06:13.160> you're<00:06:13.280> not

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
you judgment the target you're not

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.180 
you judgment the target you're not
killing<00:06:13.760> and<00:06:14.120> then<00:06:14.390> you<00:06:14.690> judgment<00:06:15.350> the<00:06:15.620> target

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
killing and then you judgment the target

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.340 
killing and then you judgment the target
you<00:06:16.310> are<00:06:16.550> killing<00:06:16.970> afterwards<00:06:17.600> to<00:06:18.110> get<00:06:18.230> that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
you are killing afterwards to get that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.220 
you are killing afterwards to get that
extra<00:06:18.590> twenty<00:06:18.919> percent<00:06:19.360> then<00:06:20.360> we<00:06:20.510> go<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.690> glyph

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
extra twenty percent then we go to glyph

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.720 
extra twenty percent then we go to glyph
of<00:06:21.380> immediate<00:06:21.800> truth<00:06:22.070> which<00:06:22.310> is<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.550> other

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
of immediate truth which is the other

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.400 
of immediate truth which is the other
option<00:06:22.820> i<00:06:23.270> would<00:06:23.419> take<00:06:23.540> if<00:06:23.750> i<00:06:23.840> didn't<00:06:24.169> need<00:06:24.290> to

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
option i would take if i didn't need to

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.890 
option i would take if i didn't need to
be<00:06:24.530> in<00:06:24.620> divine<00:06:24.919> protection<00:06:25.100> this<00:06:25.760> is<00:06:25.940> a<00:06:26.150> more

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
be in divine protection this is a more

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.530 
be in divine protection this is a more
burst<00:06:27.290> i<00:06:27.530> guess<00:06:27.770> because<00:06:28.130> it<00:06:28.580> increases<00:06:29.240> the

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
burst i guess because it increases the

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.450 
burst i guess because it increases the
instant<00:06:30.050> damage<00:06:30.380> done<00:06:30.650> by<00:06:30.680> seal<00:06:30.980> of<00:06:31.100> truth<00:06:31.280> by

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
instant damage done by seal of truth by

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.940 
instant damage done by seal of truth by
thirty<00:06:31.700> percent<00:06:32.060> but<00:06:32.750> it<00:06:32.870> does<00:06:33.140> decrease<00:06:33.440> the

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
thirty percent but it does decrease the

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.830 
thirty percent but it does decrease the
dot<00:06:34.160> damage<00:06:34.580> by<00:06:34.760> fifty<00:06:35.150> percent<00:06:35.330> which<00:06:35.660> is

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
dot damage by fifty percent which is

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.310 
dot damage by fifty percent which is
half<00:06:36.050> if<00:06:36.410> you<00:06:36.500> guys<00:06:36.650> don't<00:06:37.610> know<00:06:37.940> and<00:06:38.320> then

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
half if you guys don't know and then

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.140 
half if you guys don't know and then
thats<00:06:39.650> that's<00:06:40.100> about<00:06:40.340> it<00:06:40.370> for<00:06:40.520> glyphs<00:06:40.880> guys

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
thats that's about it for glyphs guys

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.140 
thats that's about it for glyphs guys
and<00:06:41.830> the<00:06:42.830> other<00:06:43.100> thing<00:06:43.310> i<00:06:43.640> wanted<00:06:43.850> to<00:06:43.910> talk
