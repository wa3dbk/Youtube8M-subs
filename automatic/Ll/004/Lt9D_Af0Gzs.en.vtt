00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.550
 we want to meet 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.889
 the faces 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.819
 scanty there are new players in the squad a new acting president 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.110
 Klaus Pickel 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.590
 60 years a new coach Friedhelm Funkel remained the ether 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.800
 8000 spectators stayed in Rotenburg 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.699
 to pay tribute to at the beginning 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.390
 One was curious to the right to the left 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.730
 the newcomers Baldauf Tomas APA 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.010
 from blue-white for which we neither played nor forward he likes 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.169
 clear thing at five percent 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.480
 finally decides today's mirror 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.180
 who soon after had to change the ball twice 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.800
 to stay with him for the first place in the a-group second 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.910
 but after a quarter of an hour with the British Brian 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.909
 That's not her look of Skye 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.800
 Coach from Hannover and me 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.899
 Of course he also laments the departure of may only the scorer but 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.019
 two new arrivals 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.250
 namely happy about it and Michael Koch were 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.720
 and so may 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.050
 Klatten hour Weida Eckball for Hannover yes or no referee 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.449
 Olten mirror 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.280
 decide 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.920
 on corner 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.890
 Us brings Captain 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.380
 usually the man wanted the defensive chief 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.190
 not a 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 041 the score 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.450
 13 Play again the corner of Carsten here were because Keats the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.720
 rises highest 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 and insecurity was goalkeeper ran Dreyer surprises for the citizens 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 Spectators perfect Hannover leads 1 0 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.040
 shortly thereafter, the guests convinced with some skilful combination 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 like we in the interaction between Peter Alker and I like the Cure 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.970
 Esther Alder good half hour 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 a planned interaction of the hosts 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.060
 the ASA who a pool it is not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.220
 entering protel downs the header from 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.569
 that would have been the first and last big scene of before the break 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.200
 0 2 1 the score after the change then 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.530
 the hosts like transformed clear superior dude were header Hypo 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.609
 measure up 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.389
 which served and became from Magdeburg for it 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.230
 and now 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.740
 JÃ¶rg Sievers had to do more and more the first change on Berlin side 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.729
 in the year 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 we do what Puschmann does 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.099
 then so 20 minutes in the second round once again the guests from Hannover 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.759
 the fast counter-attacks are not as numerous as in the first 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.349
 Passage with the call we 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.340
 unpleasant 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.499
 the cadre of Bremen he wobbles here 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.589
 the second module for the cat 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:50.719
 and he is pleased that then also the first to end the game prematurely because 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.329
 he has seen the first round yellow and from a repeated foul the new 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.259
 Government yellow and too big 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.259
 so he is for the next game 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.119
 yes again 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.109
 now underline 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.370
 now much stronger than in the passage as well as many 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.489
 his not 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.489
 Of course it's hard for a coach 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.559
 Weld together seven new players so that they are one unit 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.029
 form but now it is quite complacent Beringen 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.099
 again you could then parked there 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.909
 Heiko Peschke 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.029
 just missed his goal 5 times he plays the bdr-selection of the track 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.519
 halbzeit-leader 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.979
 as well as Captain Robert Holzer 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.199
 only to bring forward 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.729
 two changes still on 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.729
 Aldo Brancher page big and often went Wiedmann and Ebert came 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.870
 Drums also had to go out Markus Bayertz came 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.419
 and then this shot came from Stefan Hassler AK 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.269
 and the stock markets 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.859
 persuaded 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.859
 leaves the ball almost in the hands 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:21.479
 Photo 20 meters quite durable but the ball dodged divided one to one of 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.590
 Compensate after 81 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.849
 Reule satisfaction with the Tuttlinger appendix 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.449
 then a small fly in the oint may we have voices which has more there in the first one 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.469
 Third already seen yellow after this attack 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 by Karsten Krogmann 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.530
 Leipzig matchday begins consequences in the eyes 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.550
 Dr the new rules 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.729
 once money once red 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:46.789
 this means 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.669
 expulsion 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.669
 the break for Stefan was almost naked 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.970
 the water from the region 1 2 1 the final score 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.560
