00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
the theory gains from the policy and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.940 
the theory gains from the policy and
vice<00:01:47.289> versa<00:01:47.679> so<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.099> think<00:01:49.319> it's<00:01:50.319> you<00:01:50.679> know<00:01:50.709> it's

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
vice versa so I think it's you know it's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.739 
vice versa so I think it's you know it's
in<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.279> really<00:01:51.579> productive<00:01:51.880> way<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.240> think<00:01:52.569> like

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
in a really productive way I think like

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.769 
in a really productive way I think like
a<00:01:52.959> my<00:01:53.139> um<00:01:53.349> my<00:01:54.179> academic<00:01:55.179> world<00:01:55.329> some<00:01:55.509> extra

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
a my um my academic world some extra

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.719 
a my um my academic world some extra
crickets<00:01:56.319> have<00:01:56.409> really<00:01:56.649> converged<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.219> I'm

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
crickets have really converged on I'm

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.269 
crickets have really converged on I'm
thinking<00:01:57.789> about<00:01:58.209> political<00:01:58.359> equality<00:01:58.810> I

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
thinking about political equality I

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.230 
thinking about political equality I
pitched<00:02:00.279> the<00:02:00.459> idea<00:02:00.819> of<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.709> conference<00:02:02.709> about

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pitched the idea of a conference about

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.909 
pitched the idea of a conference about
higher<00:02:04.240> education<00:02:04.389> and<00:02:04.899> broad<00:02:05.200> access<00:02:05.679> for

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919 
higher education and broad access for

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.230 
higher education and broad access for
students<00:02:06.159> with<00:02:06.310> disabilities<00:02:06.819> about<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:07.060> year

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
students with disabilities about a year

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.570 
students with disabilities about a year
ago<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:08.259> idea<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.739> conference<00:02:09.160> was<00:02:09.340> to

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
ago the idea of the conference was to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580 
ago the idea of the conference was to
sort<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.819> get<00:02:10.030> people<00:02:10.300> thinking<00:02:10.590> both

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
sort of get people thinking both

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.960 
sort of get people thinking both
students<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.250> administrators<00:02:12.700> from

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
students and administrators from

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.059 
students and administrators from
colleges<00:02:13.300> across<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.599> country<00:02:13.720> about<00:02:14.380> what

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
colleges across the country about what

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.400 
colleges across the country about what
it<00:02:15.160> really<00:02:15.280> means<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.780> know<00:02:16.900> productively

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
it really means to you know productively

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.589 
it really means to you know productively
and<00:02:17.620> proactively<00:02:18.069> include<00:02:18.520> all<00:02:19.090> students

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
and proactively include all students

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.360 
and proactively include all students
specifically<00:02:20.470> students<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:20.890> disabilities

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
specifically students with disabilities

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.610 
specifically students with disabilities
on<00:02:21.550> campus<00:02:21.580> life<00:02:22.150> beyond<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:23.140> looking<00:02:23.500> at

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
on campus life beyond just looking at

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.770 
on campus life beyond just looking at
the<00:02:23.770> laws<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.280> think<00:02:24.460> there's<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.910> huge

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
the laws I think there's a huge

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.260 
the laws I think there's a huge
between<00:02:26.110> accessibility<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.220> equity<00:02:27.580> which

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
between accessibility and equity which

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.430 
between accessibility and equity which
is<00:02:28.420> tough<00:02:28.600> for<00:02:28.780> many<00:02:28.840> people<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.260> grasp

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
is tough for many people to grasp

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.830 
is tough for many people to grasp
because<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.790> know<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.180> because<00:02:31.420> there's<00:02:31.750> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
because you know just because there's a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.210 
because you know just because there's a
ramp<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.200> building<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.040> back

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
ramp to a building but it's in the back

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.530 
ramp to a building but it's in the back
you<00:02:33.459> know<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.730> may<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.910> an<00:02:34.030> accessible

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you know that may be an accessible

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
you know that may be an accessible
accommodation<00:02:35.080> but<00:02:35.740> it's<00:02:35.890> certainly<00:02:36.130> not<00:02:36.310> an

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
accommodation but it's certainly not an

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 
accommodation but it's certainly not an
equitable<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.959> think<00:02:38.200> more

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
equitable and we just have to think more

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.880 
equitable and we just have to think more
broadly<00:02:38.620> about<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:40.060> our<00:02:40.530> institutions<00:02:41.530> what

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
broadly about what our institutions what

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.990 
broadly about what our institutions what
our<00:02:42.069> environments<00:02:42.850> what<00:02:43.450> our<00:02:43.600> opinions<00:02:45.000> how

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
our environments what our opinions how

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.120 
our environments what our opinions how
those<00:02:46.450> sort<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:46.989> pigeonhole<00:02:47.530> certain<00:02:47.830> people

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
those sort of pigeonhole certain people

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.620 
those sort of pigeonhole certain people
how<00:02:49.120> those<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.340> affect<00:02:51.819> how<00:02:52.360> if<00:02:52.480> certain

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
how those you know affect how if certain

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.360 
how those you know affect how if certain
people<00:02:52.750> feel<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.470> think<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.830> lot<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.190> it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
people feel and so I think a lot of it

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.520 
people feel and so I think a lot of it
is<00:02:54.459> perceptual<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:56.110> terms<00:02:56.350> of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
is perceptual and so in terms of

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.080 
is perceptual and so in terms of
creating<00:02:57.010> more<00:02:57.100> equitable<00:02:57.520> environments<00:02:58.030> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
creating more equitable environments a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.729 
creating more equitable environments a
lot<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.989> know<00:02:59.350> realizing

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
lot of it is just you know realizing

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.840 
lot of it is just you know realizing
that<00:03:00.010> these<00:03:00.190> are<00:03:00.310> things<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.580> need<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.730> be

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
that these are things we need to be

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.209 
that these are things we need to be
thinking<00:03:01.150> about
