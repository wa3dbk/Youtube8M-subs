completely<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.810> really<00:01:56.850> yeah<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.030> it's<00:01:58.509> so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
completely but really yeah it's it's so

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.510 
completely but really yeah it's it's so
really<00:01:59.110> good<00:01:59.259> I<00:01:59.290> mean<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.649> regular<00:01:59.860> Oreo<00:02:00.159> shake

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
really good I mean a regular Oreo shake

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.700 
really good I mean a regular Oreo shake
is<00:02:00.670> definitely<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> 5<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.570> think<00:02:01.899> this<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
is definitely a 5 I think this is the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.069 
is definitely a 5 I think this is the
exact<00:02:02.979> same<00:02:03.219> thing<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.579> get<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.790> 5<00:02:04.030> out<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.210> 5<00:02:04.299> it's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
exact same thing I get a 5 out of 5 it's

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.590 
exact same thing I get a 5 out of 5 it's
really<00:02:05.469> decent<00:02:05.829> just<00:02:06.369> far<00:02:06.729> above<00:02:07.030> decent<00:02:07.509> is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
really decent just far above decent is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.930 
really decent just far above decent is
just<00:02:07.780> spectacular<00:02:07.899> but<00:02:08.799> at<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.610> same<00:02:09.729> time

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
just spectacular but at the same time

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.510 
just spectacular but at the same time
like<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.869> doesn't<00:02:11.140> taste<00:02:11.379> different<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.040> in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
like it doesn't taste different and in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.110 
like it doesn't taste different and in
the<00:02:12.640> least

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the least

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.360 
the least
really<00:02:13.360> I'm<00:02:13.480> getting<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.750> lot<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> Oreo<00:02:15.010> chunks

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
really I'm getting a lot of Oreo chunks

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.770 
really I'm getting a lot of Oreo chunks
so<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.520> really<00:02:15.730> didn't<00:02:15.940> have<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.180> mix<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.599> all

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so I really didn't have to mix it up all

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.430 
so I really didn't have to mix it up all
that<00:02:16.900> much

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
that much

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.590 
that much
but<00:02:17.740> it's<00:02:17.890> good<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:18.970> I'm<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.180> kind<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.450> small

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
but it's good but I'm just kind of small

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.900 
but it's good but I'm just kind of small
because<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:20.110> expecting<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.860> different<00:02:21.310> type

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
because I was expecting a different type

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.220 
because I was expecting a different type
of<00:02:22.770> shake<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.980> guess<00:02:24.810> yeah<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.080> would<00:02:26.170> have

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
of shake I guess yeah I just would have

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.050 
of shake I guess yeah I just would have
preferred<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:27.100> different<00:02:27.730> flavor<00:02:27.940> but

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
preferred to have a different flavor but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.950 
preferred to have a different flavor but
if<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.380> Oreo<00:02:30.190> shakes<00:02:30.520> already<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
if you like Oreo shakes already and you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.450 
if you like Oreo shakes already and you
see<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.040> color<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.280> it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
see this and you like the color of it

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.460 
see this and you like the color of it
you're<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:33.730> different<00:02:34.480> color<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.110> same

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you're like different color but same

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.440 
you're like different color but same
shake<00:02:35.860> that's<00:02:36.340> pretty<00:02:36.640> much<00:02:36.820> what<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.240> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
shake that's pretty much what this is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.910 
shake that's pretty much what this is
there's<00:02:37.690> no<00:02:37.780> real<00:02:38.170> big<00:02:38.380> difference<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.890> me

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
there's no real big difference to me

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.980 
there's no real big difference to me
personally<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.700> haven't<00:02:40.180> seen<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.720> Dame
