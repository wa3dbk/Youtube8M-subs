00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.090
 dmitry raskalov and as you may have noticed 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.380
 under the name we will review 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.920
 wonderful rpc emulator with three 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 my previous videos were pretty 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.430
 specific and in principle with some 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.189
 point of view one would think that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 I made a fake or someone cheating 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.990
 so I decided to arrange all the same 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 point over 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.640
 soft sign and make normal 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.579
 full video in which I explain 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.649
 how to download emulator how to run on 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 games and everything else in it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.700
 details for those who do not know 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 rcc 3 is a playstation 3 emulator 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 how not surprising that he allows on 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.410
 At this stage, it allows you to run a couple 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.870
 2d games 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 but of course he develops and seeks 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 to 3d games awesome games however 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.300
 great things but normal games 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.220
 a few more years 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.130
 we all understand and so for a start what 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.620
 do to actually download the emulator 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.820
 well actually there are three options either 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.820
 Go here for this link 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.980
 either follow this link 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.660
 this is our fan site our VKontakte groups 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.850
 that is also you can find us 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.310
 in contact with 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.900
 a reference you see that is okay point 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.130
 com slash rcc with 3 and here is our group here 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.090
 we post all the news some news 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.220
 emulation 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:57.680
 new builds and stuff on the site you can 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.010
 go into the download emulator and throw you 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.520
 to the site with all builds automatic 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.520
 and let's download the emulator 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940
 download started 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.340
 and ended 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 then simply extract to any folder on 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 your computer emulator and this is not yet 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 all some may have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 problems running an emulator can 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.550
 give an error 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.550
 missing libraries how to solve it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.640
 now he can not remember well at all 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.360
 it is necessary to install microsoft visual 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.900
 register beat region 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.770
 but there is still such a thing that is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.020
 if you have this error download this 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.580
 file from the internet and upload to the folder with 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.110
 emulator where is 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.600
 actually executable file here is a website for 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.750
 which you can go to and 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.790
 download actually in our group here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.080
 written in more detail how it is done 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.110
 so you can see here 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.790
 Further you downloaded and installed what 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.790
 need and run the emulator 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.430
 before us there is a wonderful 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:33.420
 window on this area can not pay 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.650
 attention this is for debugging here we have 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.340
 settings proper settings 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.690
 happy you 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.830
 nothing here I am left 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.580
 interpreters disassembler have time here 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.160
 here I recommend include drinking from a Jew but 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.310
 Again, I tested everything for a couple of games. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.709
 as it will be 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.800
 In other games I can not answer but in 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.459
 those I tested with this option 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.150
 works faster than 2 times later 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.239
 graphics 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.450
 changing something here I do not advise although in 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.750
 some games have a problem that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.070
 You need a resolution of exactly 1920 to 1080 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.320
 I do not know what is the reason, but in some 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.290
 games if you do not enable the resolution is 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.350
 then the game may not simulate at all but 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.560
 I think this is temporary measures. 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.780
 temporary inconvenience more precisely 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.790
 input and output don't touch anything here 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.490
 language change as long as it makes no sense 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.210
 nothing translates further under 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.830
 settings 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.790
 here we set up the actual buttons 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:55.390
 triangle 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.510
 and all others select start analog lift 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.510
 stick 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.010
 deep from 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.330
 On basically , I do not need to shift 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.610
 because they are not involved yet 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:15.650
 probably further what we need in order 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.140
 to actually play we need a game 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.550
 the folder format, that is, you need to download 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:27.840
 something like bless and certain 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.920
 code is needed not an image is not something 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.970
 another folder exactly 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.800
 Next, we press the boot button and select the game. 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.360
 folder side of us downloaded but here as 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.110
 you can see i have no sparkle and 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.150
 something like that I just have a name 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:51.020
 games are important to have these folders 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:54.240
 ps3 game ps3 update and click the folder selection and 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.440
 the game starts more accurately appears 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.440
 jess frame 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.419
 and as you can see wonderful 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.699
 fps i don't know why 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.590
 what even let's try now 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.110
 make can fix settings 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.449
 here for some reason does not change to 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.599
 disassembler here so try 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.580
 but game again and see how to lead 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.580
 yourself fps this time 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.930
 well as you can see almost in 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.310
 the number of frames has doubled and 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.700
 own game starts ie it is 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.700
 not fake 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:49.540
 games run but for now they leave 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:53.450
 want better quality and speed up to and 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:07:01.820
 support is now really possible to play 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:07:06.430
 In one game further, terrible braking 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:10.070
 something but nonetheless the game started in 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:13.000
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:16.840

 that moment will come when we can 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.990
 play 

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:28.570
 heavy rain in the flippers of ac and others
