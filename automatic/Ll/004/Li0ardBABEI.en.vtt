00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello friends and youtube subscribers 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.299
 today I bring you a magic trick called 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.280
 jack the ripper for this trick 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.900
 we're going to need two things the first 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.019
 is the letter j called jack 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.689
 and the other one is a bunch of 30 cards 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.869
 letters and how are we going to separate 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.150
 quickly this pile of the deck 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.610
 Well, with the help of two guides 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.820
 that in this case I am occupying the ace 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.220
 of spades and the king of spades and we're going to 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.739
 place in the following way we are going to 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.720
 take a guide letter and let's count 15 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:45.290
 counting the first guide letter that is 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:49.059
 a 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.650
 number 15 is going to be the second guide letter 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.740
 so we automatically know that the other 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.440
 heap consists of 15 letters 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.930
 well already having prepared this what 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.040
 place on top of the mallet 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.000
 and you may already be lost in the middle of 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 same where you are 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
 when you start this magic trick you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.760
 we will tell the spectator that we are going to take 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.150
 a letter that is the jota and we look for 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 our letter 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.970
 called yak well and we put it on the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.850
 table 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.640
 now we look for our letter our 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 first guide letter that in this case is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.720
 the king of spades and we put this pile 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.240
 on the table 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.580
 and with this pile that has left over we are going to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.190
 make a small extension asking 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.890
 the viewer who chooses a letter that 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.980
 will be the victim of jacques while the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 viewer is distracted looking for his letter 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.860
 we quickly look for our 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 second guide letter 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 This way we already know that here 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 we have 15 cards and in the other hand 15 and 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.720
 we put the two heaps 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.600
 emphasizing that they are two piles of a 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.310
 indeterminate number of letters and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.440
 suppose the viewer chooses a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.319
 any letter that can be this 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.499
 we raise the rest of the letters 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.260
 ok and now we ask you to cut these 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 two heaps in half 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.409
 approximately we do not know how many 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:33.950
 letters have been cut in each heap 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:38.329
 ok we take our letter jack and the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.040
 we put on a lot is important 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.730
 Let the two letters go on the heaps 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.180
 of the internal part and the viewer that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.139
 place your letter that we have not seen 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 about the other bunch well now we're going to 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.030
 tell him to give him more difficulty 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.069
 to find the letter to jack we're going to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.390
 change the heaps the second in the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:05.240
 first and in the first in the second 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.850
 jacques and this is very important in 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.120
 pile that contains the letter since the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.510
 we place above the other already 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.240
 then proceed to do two 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.880
 lots of letters telling the story 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.209
 I think I can do better 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:29.020
 tell that jacques was looking for his victim 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.020
 all over the city I search house by house 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.440
 street by street 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 but he could not find his victim 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.310
 well now we discard the pile that does not 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.030
 contains the letter jacques and we take the 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.790
 heap of yak 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.270
 and we do two more piles of 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.709
 letters saying that for example he went to 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.709
 look in the forest 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.060
 but jac 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.660
 neither did he find his victim discarded 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.720
 the other bunch 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.040
 and we take the bunch of jacques and we can 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:18.980
 tell another story and he went to look for it 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:21.560
 to the field and by the river and I could not find it 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.420
 and we do two more piles of 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.180
 letter saying that finally despite 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.250
 that the victim was hiding by all 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.050
 places of the world 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.870
 jacques could get it 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.539
 I kill you good friends I hope you have them 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.080
 liked the trick is a mathematical trick 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.000
 and very easy see you until the next 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.840
 do not forget to subscribe comment and leave 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.840
 a like bye
