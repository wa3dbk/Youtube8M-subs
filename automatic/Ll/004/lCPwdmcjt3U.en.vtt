input so without further ado let's take

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.070 
input so without further ado let's take
a<00:00:26.580> look<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.210> map<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> I've<00:00:27.779> seen

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a look at the first map that I've seen

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.279 
a look at the first map that I've seen
and<00:00:28.429> it's<00:00:29.429> made<00:00:29.699> by<00:00:29.820> mr.<00:00:29.970> Baca<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.990> seems

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and it's made by mr. Baca and it seems

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
and it's made by mr. Baca and it seems
pretty<00:00:31.740> simple<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.550> terms<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> actual<00:00:33.270> map

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
pretty simple in terms of the actual map

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
pretty simple in terms of the actual map
itself<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.380> middle<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.160> small<00:00:35.489> which

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
itself the middle is really small which

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.630 
itself the middle is really small which
is<00:00:36.390> uh<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.500> fine<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.829> dandy<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
is uh you know all fine and dandy I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
is uh you know all fine and dandy I
don't<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> how<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> feel<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.440> chests

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
don't know how I feel about the chests

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.229 
don't know how I feel about the chests
floating<00:00:41.370> although<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.030> cool

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
floating although it's kind of cool

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.610 
floating although it's kind of cool
because<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.660> high<00:00:42.930> risk<00:00:43.110> high<00:00:43.170> reward

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
because it's like high risk high reward

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830 
because it's like high risk high reward
but<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> big<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
but one of the big things that I like is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.420 
but one of the big things that I like is
the<00:00:45.870> fact<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.829> through<00:00:47.190> down

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the fact that you can see through down

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
the fact that you can see through down
here<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.719> gives<00:00:49.260> people<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
here and it actually gives people a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
here and it actually gives people a
reason<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.610> stay<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> line<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> stuff<00:00:52.590> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
reason to stay in line all this stuff I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.170 
reason to stay in line all this stuff I
don't<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.010> oops<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.610> am<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:56.180> okay

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
don't think oops I am if that is okay

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
don't think oops I am if that is okay
and<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.530> gives<00:00:58.770> people<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> reason<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and it actually gives people a reason to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.540 
and it actually gives people a reason to
stay<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.910> mind<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.219> there's<00:01:02.219> not

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
stay in mind all this now there's not

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
stay in mind all this now there's not
quite<00:01:02.969> enough<00:01:03.149> space<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.140> islands<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
quite enough space on these islands but

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
quite enough space on these islands but
I<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> idea<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:06.000> well<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.390> can

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
I like the idea as well that you can

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
I like the idea as well that you can
also<00:01:06.720> shoot<00:01:07.080> people<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.920> they're<00:01:08.100> camping

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
also shoot people when they're camping

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
also shoot people when they're camping

pretty<00:03:11.510> plain<00:03:11.840> but<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.140> again<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.920> enchanting

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
pretty plain but I again the enchanting

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.370 
pretty plain but I again the enchanting
table<00:03:13.550> i<00:03:13.700> think<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> great<00:03:14.209> idea<00:03:14.540> I'm<00:03:15.019> all

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
table i think is a great idea I'm all

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.280 
table i think is a great idea I'm all
down<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.280> am<00:03:16.400> falling<00:03:16.880> down<00:03:17.290> obviously

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
down for it I am falling down obviously

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.040 
down for it I am falling down obviously
I<00:03:19.190> mean<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> needs<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.360> bit<00:03:20.570> more<00:03:20.750> size

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
I mean it needs a little bit more size

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.020 
I mean it needs a little bit more size
on<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.380> outside<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.100> we're<00:03:22.550> looking<00:03:22.850> for

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
on the outside and we're looking for

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.910 
on the outside and we're looking for
stuff<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.300> really<00:03:23.750> stands<00:03:24.230> out<00:03:24.440> nothing

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
stuff that really stands out nothing

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.830 
stuff that really stands out nothing
that's<00:03:25.100> kind<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.370> like<00:03:25.489> oh<00:03:25.670> that's<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.060> room<00:03:26.300> no

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that's kind of like oh that's a room no

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.960 
that's kind of like oh that's a room no
I'm<00:03:27.140> hoping<00:03:27.560> for<00:03:27.769> something<00:03:27.980> crazy<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.820> know

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
I'm hoping for something crazy you know

I'm hoping for something crazy you know
now<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:30.200> won't<00:03:30.470> work<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.980> here's<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
now this one won't work and here's the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.130 
now this one won't work and here's the
big<00:03:31.550> issue<00:03:31.790> with<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:33.019> really

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
big issue with it is that it's really

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.550 
big issue with it is that it's really
thick<00:03:33.860> its<00:03:34.100> protective<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.970> every<00:03:35.720> side<00:03:35.989> so

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
thick its protective on every side so

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.100 
thick its protective on every side so
while<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.800> get<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.280> idea<00:03:37.430> about<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.209> we<00:03:38.810> can't

cornucopia so I like I really like the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.340 
cornucopia so I like I really like the
fact<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.210> far<00:04:29.420> Corey<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:30.230> know

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
fact that it's far Corey you know

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.350 
fact that it's far Corey you know
everyone's<00:04:31.130> gonna<00:04:31.220> build<00:04:31.580> out<00:04:31.730> just<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.240> be

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
everyone's gonna build out just to be

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.930 
everyone's gonna build out just to be
safe<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.470> does<00:04:33.860> allow<00:04:34.070> for<00:04:34.250> something

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
safe but it does allow for something

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.820 
safe but it does allow for something
that<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.480> know<00:04:35.600> maybe<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.260> little<00:04:36.530> higher

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that you know maybe a little higher

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.280 
that you know maybe a little higher
skill<00:04:37.310> level<00:04:37.610> people<00:04:37.850> look<00:04:38.540> at<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:39.020> little

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
skill level people look at it a little

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.770 
skill level people look at it a little
high<00:04:39.560> higher<00:04:40.070> still<00:04:40.460> other<00:04:40.730> people<00:04:41.210> might<00:04:41.630> be

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
high higher still other people might be

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.850 
high higher still other people might be
able<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:42.020> get<00:04:42.139> up<00:04:42.260> here<00:04:42.470> and<00:04:42.530> get<00:04:42.710> the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
able to get up here and get the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.800 
able to get up here and get the
enchanting<00:04:43.400> block<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:43.880> cornucopia<00:04:44.480> so<00:04:44.630> I

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
enchanting block in the cornucopia so I

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.930 
enchanting block in the cornucopia so I
like<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.290> idea<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.650> we're<00:04:45.860> separating<00:04:46.550> the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
like the idea that we're separating the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.240 
like the idea that we're separating the
middle<00:04:47.240> block<00:04:47.510> like<00:04:47.810> average<00:04:48.050> area<00:04:48.680> from<00:04:49.190> the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
middle block like average area from the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.640 
middle block like average area from the
skillful<00:04:50.060> people<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.080> think<00:04:51.169> that's<00:04:51.470> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
skillful people so I think that's a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
skillful people so I think that's a
great<00:04:51.889> idea<00:04:52.120> definitely<00:04:53.120> cool<00:04:53.570> idea<00:04:53.840> thank

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
great idea definitely cool idea thank

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.850 
great idea definitely cool idea thank

oh man oh this is this is one this is
like<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:03.410> one<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.830> best<00:05:04.100> nap<00:05:04.370> I've<00:05:04.730> ever

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
like it is one of the best nap I've ever

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.170 
like it is one of the best nap I've ever
this<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.960> great<00:05:06.260> this<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.590> awesome<00:05:07.250> idea<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.030> we

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
this is great this is awesome idea so we

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.850 
this is great this is awesome idea so we
have<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.510> standard<00:05:08.930> 8<00:05:09.169> maps<00:05:09.410> around<00:05:09.770> the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
have the standard 8 maps around the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.830 
have the standard 8 maps around the
outside<00:05:10.280> with<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.639> treasure<00:05:10.910> chest<00:05:11.060> going<00:05:11.630> in

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
outside with the treasure chest going in

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.170 
outside with the treasure chest going in
but<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.800> this<00:05:12.919> guy<00:05:13.130> gets<00:05:13.370> shafted<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.060> we'd

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
but and this guy gets shafted so we'd

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.390 
but and this guy gets shafted so we'd
have<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.480> fix<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:14.900> but<00:05:15.410> we<00:05:15.590> not<00:05:15.800> have<00:05:16.130> we

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
have to fix that but we not have we

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.700 
have to fix that but we not have we
don't<00:05:16.550> have<00:05:16.700> just<00:05:16.970> one<00:05:17.150> we<00:05:17.360> got<00:05:17.510> two<00:05:17.930> whole

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
don't have just one we got two whole

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.400 
don't have just one we got two whole
Middle<00:05:19.669> areas<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.510> are<00:05:20.600> separated<00:05:21.260> by

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
Middle areas that are separated by

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.129 
Middle areas that are separated by
hardcore<00:05:22.100> parkour<00:05:22.400> so<00:05:23.090> there's<00:05:23.450> I<00:05:23.600> mean<00:05:23.900> yeah

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
hardcore parkour so there's I mean yeah

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.750 
hardcore parkour so there's I mean yeah
there's<00:05:24.500> more<00:05:24.770> ways<00:05:24.980> for<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.310> mess<00:05:25.520> up

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
there's more ways for you to mess up

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.970 
there's more ways for you to mess up
it's<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:26.630> know<00:05:26.780> I<00:05:26.990> hate<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.470> fact<00:05:27.680> that<00:05:27.800> this

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
it's you know I hate the fact that this

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.280 
it's you know I hate the fact that this
is<00:05:28.160> this<00:05:28.340> but<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.480> know<00:05:29.600> we'd<00:05:29.810> probably<00:05:30.110> have

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
is this but you know we'd probably have

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.650 
is this but you know we'd probably have
that<00:05:30.680> change<00:05:31.010> a<00:05:31.160> little<00:05:31.280> bit<00:05:31.430> but<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.120> opens<00:05:32.540> up

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
that change a little bit but it opens up

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.860 
that change a little bit but it opens up
so<00:05:33.050> much<00:05:33.260> more<00:05:34.030> possibilities<00:05:35.030> for<00:05:35.360> fighting

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
so much more possibilities for fighting

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.200 
so much more possibilities for fighting
between<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.410> two<00:05:36.620> maybe<00:05:37.220> have<00:05:37.460> like<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.639> nice

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
between the two maybe have like a nice

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.659 
between the two maybe have like a nice
little<00:05:38.449> upper<00:05:39.290> level<00:05:39.590> parkour<00:05:40.040> between<00:05:40.460> these

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
little upper level parkour between these

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.330 
little upper level parkour between these
but<00:05:41.150> this<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.449> such<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.750> cool<00:05:41.990> idea<00:05:42.139> to<00:05:42.530> maps<00:05:43.010> or

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
but this is such a cool idea to maps or

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.150 
but this is such a cool idea to maps or
two<00:05:43.790> middle<00:05:44.180> items<00:05:44.660> not<00:05:44.960> just<00:05:45.320> one<00:05:45.560> two

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
two middle items not just one two

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.159 
two middle items not just one two
islands<00:05:46.669> I<00:05:46.880> think<00:05:47.480> this<00:05:47.570> is<00:05:47.630> one<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.990> best

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
islands I think this is one of the best

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.350 
islands I think this is one of the best
ideas<00:05:48.620> and<00:05:48.860> with<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.280> couple<00:05:49.639> changes<00:05:49.910> we<00:05:50.210> might

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
ideas and with a couple changes we might

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.870 
ideas and with a couple changes we might
just<00:05:50.389> take<00:05:50.750> this<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.169> use<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:51.380> so<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.949> don't<00:05:52.669> see

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
just take this and use it so I don't see

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.510 
just take this and use it so I don't see
any<00:05:53.000> signs<00:05:53.449> around<00:05:53.750> here<00:05:54.080> who<00:05:54.230> built<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.770> but

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
any signs around here who built it but

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.700 
any signs around here who built it but
this<00:05:55.639> is<00:05:55.699> insanely<00:05:56.389> well<00:05:56.750> done<00:05:56.990> now<00:05:57.320> again<00:05:57.560> we

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
this is insanely well done now again we

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.400 
this is insanely well done now again we
have<00:05:57.919> a<00:05:57.949> very<00:05:58.400> typical<00:05:58.960> generic<00:05:59.960> island<00:06:00.350> on

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
have a very typical generic island on

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.650 
have a very typical generic island on
the<00:06:00.440> outside<00:06:00.919> with<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.220> crazy<00:06:01.580> middle<00:06:02.150> the

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
the outside with a crazy middle the

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.650 
the outside with a crazy middle the
middle<00:06:02.690> is<00:06:03.139> big<00:06:03.410> and<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.860> like<00:06:04.130> large<00:06:04.820> middle

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
middle is big and I like large middle

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.510 
middle is big and I like large middle
islands<00:06:06.320> I<00:06:06.410> don't<00:06:06.680> want<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:06.889> sound<00:06:07.040> dirty<00:06:07.340> but

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
islands I don't want to sound dirty but

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.189 
islands I don't want to sound dirty but
I<00:06:07.669> like<00:06:07.910> large<00:06:08.150> middle<00:06:08.419> island<00:06:08.660> because<00:06:09.080> it

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
I like large middle island because it

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.780 
I like large middle island because it
just<00:06:09.320> allows<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:09.949> many<00:06:10.010> more<00:06:10.250> people<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.669> be

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
just allows so many more people to be

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.060 
just allows so many more people to be
coexisting<00:06:11.660> on<00:06:11.780> that<00:06:11.960> island<00:06:12.199> you<00:06:12.800> know<00:06:12.919> it's

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
coexisting on that island you know it's

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.620 
coexisting on that island you know it's
not<00:06:13.130> you<00:06:13.490> don't<00:06:13.610> feel<00:06:13.820> like<00:06:14.030> trapped<00:06:14.360> out<00:06:14.600> here

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
not you don't feel like trapped out here

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.439 
not you don't feel like trapped out here
right<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.290> that<00:06:15.800> is<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.130> goal<00:06:16.400> but<00:06:17.030> just

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
right you that is the goal but just

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.180 
right you that is the goal but just
because<00:06:17.600> one<00:06:17.990> person<00:06:18.020> is<00:06:18.530> over<00:06:18.710> there<00:06:18.860> does

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
because one person is over there does

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.440 
because one person is over there does
mean<00:06:19.310> that<00:06:19.460> you<00:06:19.580> can't<00:06:19.790> go<00:06:19.940> over<00:06:19.970> there<00:06:20.240> so<00:06:20.420> I

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
mean that you can't go over there so I

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.100 
mean that you can't go over there so I
like<00:06:20.720> larger<00:06:21.620> middle<00:06:21.890> islands<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.400> looks<00:06:22.610> good

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
like larger middle islands it looks good

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.480 
like larger middle islands it looks good
the<00:06:24.110> only<00:06:24.320> downside<00:06:24.530> is<00:06:24.830> that<00:06:24.980> there's<00:06:25.310> not<00:06:25.430> a

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
the only downside is that there's not a

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.270 
the only downside is that there's not a
lot<00:06:25.760> of<00:06:26.140> looking<00:06:27.140> inward<00:06:27.620> on<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:28.010> if<00:06:28.160> that

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
lot of looking inward on it if that

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.760 
lot of looking inward on it if that
makes<00:06:28.340> sense<00:06:28.760> so<00:06:29.120> for<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:29.630> most<00:06:29.810> part<00:06:30.110> if

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
makes sense so for the most part if

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.200 
makes sense so for the most part if
you're<00:06:30.980> fighting<00:06:31.430> on<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.610> inside<00:06:32.030> you're

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
you're fighting on the inside you're

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.580 
you're fighting on the inside you're
fighting<00:06:32.450> on<00:06:32.540> the<00:06:32.630> inside<00:06:32.960> it<00:06:33.290> would<00:06:33.410> be<00:06:33.470> good

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
fighting on the inside it would be good

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.370 
fighting on the inside it would be good
to<00:06:33.650> have<00:06:33.860> more<00:06:34.250> room<00:06:34.490> to<00:06:34.760> move<00:06:35.030> about<00:06:35.450> because

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
to have more room to move about because

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.500 
to have more room to move about because
I<00:06:36.500> get<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.800> idea<00:06:36.920> i<00:06:37.160> get<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.520> theme<00:06:37.760> but<00:06:38.360> if

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
I get the idea i get the theme but if

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.300 
I get the idea i get the theme but if
you're<00:06:38.630> fighting<00:06:39.080> someone<00:06:39.380> in<00:06:39.500> here<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:39.950> they

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
you're fighting someone in here and they

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.070 
you're fighting someone in here and they
just<00:06:40.490> drop<00:06:40.730> lava<00:06:41.030> down<00:06:41.330> like<00:06:41.570> it's<00:06:41.720> game<00:06:41.930> over

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
just drop lava down like it's game over

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:50.080 
just drop lava down like it's game over
so<00:06:45.820> points<00:06:47.800> that<00:06:48.800> is<00:06:48.980> a<00:06:49.010> game<00:06:49.430> that<00:06:49.850> is

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
so points that is a game that is

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.930 
so points that is a game that is
game-changing<00:06:50.570> that<00:06:51.530> is<00:06:52.160> game-changing<00:06:52.600> this

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
game-changing that is game-changing this
