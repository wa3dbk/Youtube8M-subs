00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 the kill for a long time I had always 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.840
 believed that any measure sentence was a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.639
 kind of evolution and now I 'm 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.330
 realized that all I have 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.420

 clearly ship to the port if the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.330
 lightning and the roar of thunder 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.050
 hit the creams in the middle and raise 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.570
 my mind is not chess and I 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540

 on their writings and I succeeded thanks to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.539
 two tries I remember standing 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.360
 in the middle of a room are almost at 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.809
 rigarda work a small window and in 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.170
 thinking that I was the most 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:01:00.350
 desirable a wreck manta is successful nsg 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 I was discouraged almost hopeless 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.229
 I was an exe the life for me is a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.330
 burden 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 I headed for the window at 20 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 h at the church to eat however the bar 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.580
 in the morning while trying to watch I 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 reminds me of looking where one of 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.950
 barbey walls the highest and I have 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.619
 never seen 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.320
 after a while I turned around 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.920
 look at my cell I remember 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.070
 look at the walls and ceilings army 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.670
 asked the question what did I do 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.700
 to find myself here I thought about my 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.220
 grammar for a moment I had 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.640
 the impression of feeling the pain of a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.090
 little girl on a pinch in the heart 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.210
 much more + 5 memory 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.060
 it allowed me to travel back 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 throughout my child throughout 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.240
 my suffering is worth it 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.269
 go back to my past this place where 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.880
 I knew and but was tested at the same 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.030
 time where everything like ac 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.400
 but my reality at this moment and that I 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.950
 found myself locked in a center 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.230
 city ​​of tension in pure concern 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.680
 to be evicted in the next 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.260
 hours or a few days and my only 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.200
 crime would have been to change the position 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.710
 is the sanctuary of the nation that I 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.560
 believed to be able to help me during these three 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.360
 sleepless nights and foam day 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 Finally, I saw my life in front of me 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.040
 as the end of math acting troubles 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.570
 hang on and I would have liked to say for 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.970
 see it in a better way 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.270
 throughout my stay in the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.400
 detention center for immigration 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.590
 I was surprised why no one 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 could see unless I was a 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.680
 honest man I was just a young 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.590
 very very frustrated man in all the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.680
 old purple that had never 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.450
 had the chance to be accepted by all who 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.240
 had lost everything that was dear to him 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.850
 I felt all alone is excluded from the 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 mans after my release 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.230
 I felt after fleeing my country 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.080
 that I wanted to become someone else 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.740
 is appointed and does not speak the language of the 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.069
 an inexperienced Martian country too naive 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.499
 and lose my self-love been broken 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.549
 I wanted to do everything but I did not know 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.909
 not who I was 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.209
 or even if life had a meaning I 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.519
 thought about my life for a moment and I 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.069
 did not know it existed until 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.489
 what gave it to me who gave me 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 I was tired and when I started to 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.400
 enjoy life with all my organs 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.090
 senses all the same beautiful and all one 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.090
 sense and I got attached to life and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.239
 I did not want the call finding of the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.450
 life will end or how it had been 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.590
 given is of lesser drop but as 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.930
 elderly life is major importance i 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.449
 always thought that there is some 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.090
 thing at the bottom of the mans who always had 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.940
 want a better always 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.240
 want to surpass themselves to be something 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.389
 anything but what I am 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.599
 we become our own judges we 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.060
 have set limits but it's only 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.250
 when we go beyond its limits and 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.479
 we start to live properly 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.740
 my motto was always the same cross 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.030
 came true and when I think about life 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.910
 charge to suffice his sentence 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.060
 I do not look back for 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.220
 would surely have gone past he's dead she 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.870
 is all the ways I can not the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.240
 switch 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.930
 I do not want to be troubled to wear 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.490
 my future 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.830
 he is still coming gifi the present and 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.740
