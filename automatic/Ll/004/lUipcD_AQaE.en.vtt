toes<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.680> tremor<00:03:25.010> wheels<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.650> what<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:31.000> in

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
toes on tremor wheels and what do is in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.430 
toes on tremor wheels and what do is in
this<00:03:32.299> groove<00:03:32.660> here<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.160> here<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:35.440> put

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
this groove here and here and here I put

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.320 
this groove here and here and here I put
fishing<00:03:36.889> line<00:03:37.510> Tiger<00:03:38.510> end

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
fishing line Tiger end

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.200 
fishing line Tiger end
then<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.690> stops<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.230> wheels<00:03:41.560> from<00:03:42.550> balloon<00:03:42.970> in

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
then it stops the wheels from balloon in

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.950 
then it stops the wheels from balloon in
when<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.900> get<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.260> speed<00:03:45.510> which<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.690> really

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
when you get to speed which is really

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.020 
when you get to speed which is really
good<00:03:47.170> because<00:03:47.740> it<00:03:48.010> keeps<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.310> nut<00:03:48.550> case<00:03:48.820> all

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
good because it keeps it nut case all

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.180 
good because it keeps it nut case all

so<00:04:35.140> I'd<00:04:35.200> run<00:04:35.760> these<00:04:36.760> wheels<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.370> car<00:04:40.170> with

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
so I'd run these wheels on that car with

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.460 
so I'd run these wheels on that car with
it<00:04:41.410> with<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:41.940> different<00:04:42.940> spur<00:04:43.450> gears<00:04:43.780> pinion

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
it with a different spur gears pinion

it with a different spur gears pinion
gear<00:04:45.390> one<00:04:46.390> thing<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.690> have<00:04:46.840> come<00:04:47.050> across<00:04:47.220> which

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
gear one thing I have come across which

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.380 
gear one thing I have come across which
I<00:04:48.340> use<00:04:48.520> as<00:04:48.790> well<00:04:49.000> for<00:04:49.240> bashing<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:50.290> really<00:04:50.710> good

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.820 

it<00:06:10.060> runs<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.450> lot<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.780> don't<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.110> know<00:06:11.140> a<00:06:11.500> little

it runs a lot I don't you know a little

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.850 
it runs a lot I don't you know a little
Salem's<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.400> lot<00:06:12.520> better<00:06:12.700> but<00:06:12.910> it<00:06:13.240> certainly

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
Salem's a lot better but it certainly

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
Salem's a lot better but it certainly
makes<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:15.070> car<00:06:16.770> not<00:06:17.770> much<00:06:18.040> more<00:06:20.880> unsusceptible
