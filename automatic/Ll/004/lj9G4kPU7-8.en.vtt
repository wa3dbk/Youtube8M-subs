thought it was the right thing to do
just<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.979> give<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.310> ball<00:02:10.459> back<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.720> low

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
just to give the ball back to the low

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.820 
just to give the ball back to the low
