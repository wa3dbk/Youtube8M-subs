00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 hello everyone i'm miguel ribera 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.789
 we continue explaining the song dust 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.850
 in the wind of kansas we are now in 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.440
 the chorus 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.440
 to whistle a little 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.230
 i 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.379
 first refrains asia then explains 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.109
 of the second because we go back to the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.469
 astro fa not then know we started with 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.929
 a re chord with bass in sharp F 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.299
 in certain songs it's played like that 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:56.620
 here as we come from a minor side 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:59.010
 he said move from the least 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.280
 the low record in faster jockey voting 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 with the 3 I do not keep fixed despi vote there 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.640
 not then we have little finger in this 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.940
 delay from the second of 23 in the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.250
 second after yielding the third and two in 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.960
 the sixth the second fret 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.410
 the arpeggio of the right hand is the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.850
 same as always when the bass as 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.710
 explain already in the stanza they were sixth 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.720
 rope the thumb and balances both esm 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.650
 in turn the sixth string 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.650
 it would not be normal 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.470
 here is how it is 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.270
 after here 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.750
 we go to a sun that I just need 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.820
 put makes it already appear only the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 astro fashion element 3 in the sixth 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.330
 rope and also alternating this and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.450
 fourth does not happen that now will do what 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.450
 following 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.380
 to put here the fifth the note yes that 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.690
 also part of the accordÃ© de sol 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.580
 here then it will be done this with 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.950
 second then fourth third then another 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.429
 once you are with second but after 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.560
 that's just a thumb hit here 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.560
 in the fifth 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 Y 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.520
 again 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.769
 here we would have the record low 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.769
 transferred 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.860
 and from here it's like he does it for 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.670
 jump to the youngest and give him more time 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.670
 it does not do like 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.280
 make that change without having to give a 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.280
 note to the middle then 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.220
 and we jump to the smallest with the middle finger 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.450
 in second they are a normal minor like 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.130
 when we did in the intro and then the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.990
 I have to put it on the note 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.260
 only what we go a the minor with low 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.260
 on the sun 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.799
 this would be let's say a part of 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.799
 chorus 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.210
 here again I put myself of the minor with 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.640
 low sun and voting on tc finger with what 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.640
 that again in the bassoon false had 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.420
 here when they go the youngest makes a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.940
 hammer goes like in his two the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.930
 second is on air then he touched 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.030
 fifth with second and then finger one 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.799
 in only the left hand of a hammer 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.330
 there to the fret one to two and it's the same 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.330
 mechanism and the right hand really 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.629
 it does not pass declared 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.720
 in a hummer it's like there's a note 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:06.940
 more in beta taca taca taca will be taca 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.940
 taca taca all with sixteenths 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.230
 Look 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.550
 and then he does the same javier but the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.470
 difference is that in the first one has 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.470
 is sixteenths 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.320
 and in the second one is an order I touch you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.320
 second with fifth but I'm going very fast 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.680
 and here I'm going to the sun with bass itself 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.680
 I call the stanza 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.240
 as we did before the difference with the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.490
 second chorus is that as he does not die 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.290
 do not forgive the second refrain that 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.290
 think if we do 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.840
 i 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.830
 the second is your life after the 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.210
 second round of wrote name with 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.680
 low sun content here is already going to 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.800
 what we're going to call going interlude 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.440
 to be in the next video that is a the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.440
 lower than 9 that does here 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.219
 then it would be 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.490
 and it goes to the interior 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.680
 we see this in the following video as well 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.150
 that nothing when you have is cured 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.150
 we continue with others see you
