00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
before the end of the first half this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.890 
before the end of the first half this
could<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.920> huge<00:03:38.010> play<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.540> would<00:03:39.630> set<00:03:39.810> up

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
could be a huge play but it would set up

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.069 
could be a huge play but it would set up
a<00:03:39.989> third<00:03:40.200> 19<00:03:40.709> 10<00:03:41.010> seconds<00:03:41.489> left<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.820> go<00:03:42.000> after<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
a third 19 10 seconds left to go after a

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.580 
a third 19 10 seconds left to go after a
couple<00:03:43.380> bad<00:03:43.590> sacks<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.870> Garoppolo<00:03:45.870> airs<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.500> up

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
couple bad sacks as Garoppolo airs it up

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.890 
couple bad sacks as Garoppolo airs it up
to<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.799> right<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.670> isn't<00:03:47.970> complete<00:03:48.390> again

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
to the right and it isn't complete again

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900 
to the right and it isn't complete again
so<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.799> would<00:03:49.950> would<00:03:50.130> bring<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.400> fourth<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
so that would would bring up fourth and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.479 
so that would would bring up fourth and
19<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.200> Patriots<00:03:52.680> with<00:03:52.950> great<00:03:53.250> field

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

position<00:03:53.579> could<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.329> punch<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.320> as<00:03:56.100> ahead

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
position could not punch it in as ahead

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.800 
position could not punch it in as ahead
three<00:03:56.579> tries<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.970> do<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.390> they<00:03:57.420> were<00:03:57.600> call

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
three tries to do it so they were call

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.660
