00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
I've just got collapsed up just because

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
I've just got collapsed up just because
it<00:01:54.930> makes<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.710> supports<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> makes<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.490> nice

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
it makes me it supports it makes a nice

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
it makes me it supports it makes a nice
display<00:01:56.880> piece<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.509> fold<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> belt

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
display piece of you just fold the belt

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.219 
display piece of you just fold the belt
up<00:01:59.060> but<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.119> driver<00:02:00.360> itself<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> said<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
up but the driver itself like I said it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.109 
up but the driver itself like I said it
just<00:02:01.259> has<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.560> side<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> comes<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> DX

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
just has one side it comes with a DX

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.889 
just has one side it comes with a DX
eternal<00:02:03.719> memory<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.409> heard<00:02:05.899> has

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
eternal memory which you just heard has

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.040 
eternal memory which you just heard has
a<00:02:06.930> yellow<00:02:07.320> light<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.620 

and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> does<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.450> little

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and then it does have the little

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.880 
and then it does have the little
pictures<00:02:12.930> inside<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.530> works<00:02:13.710> with<00:02:13.800> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
pictures inside so it works with a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.150 
pictures inside so it works with a
driver<00:02:14.100> so<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> slap<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.890> hear<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
driver so you slap it in you hear the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
driver so you slap it in you hear the
activation<00:02:17.730> noise<00:02:23.720> he's<00:02:24.720> actually<00:02:24.870> got<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
activation noise he's actually got a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.420 
activation noise he's actually got a
pretty<00:02:25.290> cool<00:02:25.530> henshin<00:02:25.830> sound<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.310> much

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
pretty cool henshin sound like as much

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.220 
pretty cool henshin sound like as much
as<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> big<00:02:27.510> fan<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.720> eternal

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
as like I'm not a big fan of eternal

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.860 
as like I'm not a big fan of eternal
himself<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:30.380> she's<00:02:31.380> kind<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.710> cool<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
himself but that she's kind of cool and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.070 
himself but that she's kind of cool and
so<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> United<00:02:34.290> lights<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.770> yellow<00:02:35.040> down<00:02:35.220> here

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
so the United lights up yellow down here

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:50.750 
so the United lights up yellow down here
he's<00:02:37.080> got<00:02:37.200> his<00:02:37.350> maximum<00:02:37.770> Drive<00:02:38.040> slot<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:50.730> a

regular writer guy memories from the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.140 
regular writer guy memories from the
series<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.860> basically<00:03:08.730> they're<00:03:08.940> just

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
series and basically they're just

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
series and basically they're just
they're<00:03:09.360> newer<00:03:09.570> versions<00:03:10.050> there's<00:03:10.320> two<00:03:10.560> two

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
they're newer versions there's two two

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.120 
they're newer versions there's two two
versions<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.340> lot<00:03:11.520> of<00:03:11.900> Joker<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.170> doubles

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
versions of a lot of Joker of doubles

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.350 
versions of a lot of Joker of doubles
memories<00:03:14.520> as<00:03:14.670> well<00:03:15.080> and<00:03:16.640> basically<00:03:17.640> eternals

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
memories as well and basically eternals

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.240 
memories as well and basically eternals
power<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.870> when<00:03:19.020> he<00:03:19.110> uses<00:03:19.290> his<00:03:19.410> maximum<00:03:19.920> Drive

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
power is when he uses his maximum Drive

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.430 
power is when he uses his maximum Drive
it<00:03:20.459> renders<00:03:20.820> all<00:03:21.120> previous<00:03:21.959> versions<00:03:22.020> of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it renders all previous versions of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.780 
it renders all previous versions of
memories<00:03:22.740> obsolete<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.520> don't<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
memories obsolete so if you don't have a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.630 
memories obsolete so if you don't have a
t2<00:03:24.150> memory<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.660> stops<00:03:25.260> working<00:03:25.640> obviously

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
t2 memory it stops working obviously

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.830 
t2 memory it stops working obviously
they<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.850> around<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.209> by<00:03:27.360> blowing<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
they get around this by blowing up the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.460 
they get around this by blowing up the
eternal<00:03:28.200> memory<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:28.620> yeah<00:03:30.230> but<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.410> know

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
eternal memory but yeah but you know

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.190 
eternal memory but yeah but you know
there's<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:32.240> but<00:03:33.240> in<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.110> get

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
there's that but in in the if you get

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.750 
there's that but in in the if you get
the<00:03:34.320> guy<00:03:34.440> selection<00:03:34.890> -<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.160> there<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.370> DX

with<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.480> lost<00:04:03.690> driver<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.230> can

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
with the with the lost driver so you can

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.040 
with the with the lost driver so you can
plug<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.770> joker<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.780> doesn't<00:04:06.780> make<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
plug in joker and doesn't make the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.080 
plug in joker and doesn't make the
activation<00:04:07.650> noise<00:04:07.830> until<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.730> switch<00:04:08.970> it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
activation noise until you switch it

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.130 
activation noise until you switch it
over<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.300> doesn't<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.630> all<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.900> special

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
over it doesn't have all the special

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.949 
over it doesn't have all the special
noises<00:04:10.560> doesn't<00:04:10.830> have<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> lights<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.810> you

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
noises doesn't have the lights but you

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.560 
noises doesn't have the lights but you
can<00:04:13.050> plug<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:17.970> does<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.270> Joker

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
can plug it in and it does the Joker

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.940 
can plug it in and it does the Joker
noise<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:18.960> away<00:04:19.169> since<00:04:19.410> there's<00:04:19.620> no<00:04:19.770> other

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
noise right away since there's no other

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.640 
noise right away since there's no other
half

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
half

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:31.230 
half
to<00:04:21.609> activate<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.830> scope<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.880> pretty<00:04:31.120> much

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
to activate it and scope so pretty much

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.029 
to activate it and scope so pretty much
what<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.509> DX<00:04:31.780> memories<00:04:32.139> would<00:04:32.259> do<00:04:32.440> just

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
what the DX memories would do just

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.680 
what the DX memories would do just
without<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.430> lights<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.030> extra<00:04:34.330> sounds

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
without the lights and the extra sounds

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.300 
without the lights and the extra sounds
of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> activational<00:04:35.470> less<00:04:35.620> stuff<00:04:35.800> will<00:04:36.160> show

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
of the activational less stuff will show

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.740 
of the activational less stuff will show
off<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> DX<00:04:36.880> memories<00:04:37.210> for<00:04:37.389> both<00:04:37.509> of<00:04:37.660> these

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
off the DX memories for both of these

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.909 
off the DX memories for both of these
once<00:04:38.139> they<00:04:38.320> get<00:04:38.500> here

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
once they get here

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.460 
once they get here
now<00:04:39.759> you<00:04:39.820> can<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.539> maximum<00:04:40.840> drive<00:04:41.199> over

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
now you can do the maximum drive over

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.600 
now you can do the maximum drive over
here<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:42.009> cycle<00:04:42.250> through<00:04:42.520> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
here but you have to cycle through the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:52.170 
here but you have to cycle through the
sound<00:04:42.880> data<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.430> can<00:04:51.639> do<00:04:51.850> it<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.120> you

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
sound data so you can do it and you

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.000 
sound data so you can do it and you
can't<00:04:52.389> make<00:04:52.449> all<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.810> noises<00:04:52.990> in<00:04:53.380> order<00:04:53.650> these

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
can't make all the noises in order these

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.800 
can't make all the noises in order these
are<00:04:54.130> basically<00:04:54.490> function<00:04:55.000> as<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.570> sound

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
are basically function as the sound

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.629 
are basically function as the sound
capsule<00:04:56.260> memories<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.860> cycle<00:04:57.610> through

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
capsule memories you just cycle through

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:09.930 
capsule memories you just cycle through
all<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.820> different<00:04:57.910> sounds<00:04:58.510> so<00:05:08.729> yeah<00:05:09.729> just

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
all the different sounds so yeah just

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
all the different sounds so yeah just
like<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> sound<00:05:10.300> capsule<00:05:10.600> memories<00:05:10.840> they

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
like the sound capsule memories they

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.629 
like the sound capsule memories they
make<00:05:11.229> all<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.560> noises<00:05:11.740> they<00:05:12.070> just<00:05:12.310> don't<00:05:12.490> make

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
make all the noises they just don't make

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.310 
make all the noises they just don't make
them<00:05:12.780> automatically<00:05:13.780> because<00:05:14.080> they<00:05:14.169> don't

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
them automatically because they don't

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.629 
them automatically because they don't
have<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.530> extra<00:05:14.800> buttons<00:05:15.070> down<00:05:15.190> here<00:05:15.250> that

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
have the extra buttons down here that

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.680 
have the extra buttons down here that
activate<00:05:16.090> when<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.300> put<00:05:16.449> them<00:05:16.539> in<00:05:16.630> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
activate when you put them in the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.469 
activate when you put them in the
drivers<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.580> then<00:05:18.669> just<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:18.940> show<00:05:18.970> off<00:05:19.300> how

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
drivers and then just to show off how

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:20.760 
drivers and then just to show off how
you<00:05:19.509> can<00:05:19.810> actually<00:05:19.960> see<00:05:20.199> you<00:05:20.289> actually<00:05:20.590> can

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
you can actually see you actually can

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.870 
you can actually see you actually can
use<00:05:20.949> a<00:05:20.979> dopent<00:05:21.370> memory<00:05:21.699> in<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.940> driver<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:24.849> the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
use a dopent memory in the driver to the

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.860 
use a dopent memory in the driver to the
best<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.180> my<00:05:25.240> knowledge<00:05:25.300> that's<00:05:25.660> never

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
best of my knowledge that's never

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.210 
best of my knowledge that's never
happened<00:05:26.229> on<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.410> show<00:05:26.590> or<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:26.949> movies

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
happened on the show or in the movies

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.850 
happened on the show or in the movies
which<00:05:27.400> none<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.639> them<00:05:27.729> I<00:05:27.849> haven't<00:05:28.240> seen<00:05:28.860> axle

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
which none of them I haven't seen axle

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.540 
which none of them I haven't seen axle
of<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.039> eternal<00:05:30.400> movies<00:05:30.669> yet<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:32.370> maybe<00:05:33.370> they

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
of the eternal movies yet so maybe they

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.620 
of the eternal movies yet so maybe they
do<00:05:33.610> them<00:05:33.789> there<00:05:33.970> but<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.180> haven't<00:05:34.419> seen<00:05:34.570> them

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
do them there but I haven't seen them

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.969 
do them there but I haven't seen them
actually<00:05:34.780> but<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.229> can<00:05:35.410> if<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.620> want<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.889> can

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
actually but you can if you want you can

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.689 
actually but you can if you want you can
plug<00:05:36.130> in<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.280> house<00:05:36.370> guy<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.669> there<00:05:41.580> just<00:05:42.580> if

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
plug in the house guy in there just if

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.620 
plug in the house guy in there just if
you<00:05:42.789> want<00:05:43.000> it's<00:05:43.599> a<00:05:43.690> little<00:05:43.870> weird<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.449> said

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
you want it's a little weird like I said

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.710 
you want it's a little weird like I said
that<00:05:46.780> they<00:05:47.080> never<00:05:47.260> did<00:05:47.409> it<00:05:47.440> on<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.740> show

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
that they never did it on the show

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.480 
that they never did it on the show
itself<00:05:49.720> but<00:05:50.590> if<00:05:50.770> you<00:05:50.860> ever<00:05:50.949> wanted<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.310> just

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
itself but if you ever wanted to just

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.460 
itself but if you ever wanted to just
use<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.639> dopent<00:05:52.030> memory<00:05:52.360> in<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.690> driver<00:05:52.930> you

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
use a dopent memory in the driver you

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.310 
use a dopent memory in the driver you
can<00:05:54.060> but<00:05:55.060> that's<00:05:55.510> all<00:05:55.690> there<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:55.870> to<00:05:56.050> it<00:05:56.169> like<00:05:56.289> I

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
can but that's all there is to it like I

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.230 
can but that's all there is to it like I
said<00:05:56.440> it's<00:05:56.590> basically<00:05:56.800> just<00:05:57.010> a<00:05:57.190> basic<00:05:57.580> or<00:05:57.760> just

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
said it's basically just a basic or just

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.689 
said it's basically just a basic or just
half<00:05:58.599> of<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.900> double<00:05:59.169> driver<00:06:02.190> there<00:06:03.190> is<00:06:03.400> the

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
half of the double driver there is the

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.620 
half of the double driver there is the
common<00:06:04.240> writer<00:06:04.389> double<00:06:04.780> lost<00:06:05.320> driver
