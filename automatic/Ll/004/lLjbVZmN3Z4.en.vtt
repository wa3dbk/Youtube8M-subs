00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
of it and I'll show you how to do that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.620 
of it and I'll show you how to do that
next<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.460> case<00:02:18.790> because<00:02:19.120> I'm<00:02:19.450> not

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
next but in this case because I'm not

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.600

going to take all of my powder and I'm
going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.160> put<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.550> all<00:02:24.790> into<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.390> cake

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
going to put it all into this cake

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.540 
going to put it all into this cake
batter<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.680> going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.980> make<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.370> cake

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
batter and it's going to make the cake

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.550 
batter and it's going to make the cake
batter<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> little<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.300> thicker<00:02:28.630> but<00:02:29.260> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
batter a little bit thicker but that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960 
batter a little bit thicker but that
will<00:02:29.680> work<00:02:29.710> out<00:02:29.980> fine<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.670> you're<00:02:30.790> really

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
will work out fine but if you're really

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.550 
will work out fine but if you're really
worried<00:02:31.420> about<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.080> add<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> little

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
worried about it you can add a little

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280 
worried about it you can add a little
like<00:02:32.830> tablespoon<00:02:33.400> or<00:02:33.550> two<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> milk<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.690> so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
like tablespoon or two of milk to it so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.950 
like tablespoon or two of milk to it so
just<00:02:35.500> carefully<00:02:35.950> mix<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:37.570> we

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
just carefully mix it in and then we

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.080 
just carefully mix it in and then we
will<00:02:37.990> put<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.590> into<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.950> pan<00:02:39.130> next<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:40.060> each

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
will put it into the pan next for each

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.540 
will put it into the pan next for each
individual<00:02:40.960> cake<00:02:41.620> batter<00:02:41.980> that's<00:02:42.310> been

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
of the tricks that I separated so like I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.030 
of the tricks that I separated so like I
said<00:03:07.540> earlier<00:03:07.900> we're<00:03:08.320> going<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.770> using

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
said earlier we're going to be using

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.740

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
going to be done just slightly different

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.210 
going to be done just slightly different
than<00:03:12.820> we<00:03:13.000> did<00:03:13.180> for<00:03:13.720> all<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.020> other<00:03:14.170> colors<00:03:14.740> so
