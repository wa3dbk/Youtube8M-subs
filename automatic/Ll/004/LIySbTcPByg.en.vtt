00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.510
 How about how are they doing better? 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.100
 beyond the temperature what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.620
 that we have a good instrument 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.269
 airs 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.799
 that's why I have the windows closed and 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.250
 we started the air 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.130
 here in the kitchen 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.099
 the dining room actually 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.150
 I wanted to continue with this 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.190
 contact just like he can passed to 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.800
 this same hour 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.680
 and the deal with you go taking advantage 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 the chance we have to interact 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.630
 I want to thank you all because the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.010
 true that 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.620
 as time passes 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.080
 really more and more people are 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.200
 that are contacted are more people 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.440
 who put 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.940
 your best intention 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.809
 that put good energy that burning 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.359
 cool 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.399
 and that they understand that all that we're going 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.979
 writing and everything is interaction that is 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.070
 generates is not something that is for me 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.780
 only but for all those who 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.990
 that are part of this 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.470
 from this little community that we're going 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.460
 forming that is also formed with 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.560
 romantics every night that you 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.800
 they form with Chinese lions dotcom that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.440
 we share on my facebook 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.290
 Chinese leandro Leonys and also what 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.560
 we are continuously writing freshly 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.240
 is talking to a great friend of mine who 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.400
 is Manuel FlÃ³rez who is one of the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.050
 administrators that has the page and is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.810
 one of the people who pushed me to 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:45.070
 that starts this way of expanding 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.370
 with the page and others 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.420
 and he told me 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:55.100
 Voncina, that's a guy 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.650
 that can hardly sell something of what 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.509
 which you are not convinced something that you do not 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.450
 you bought and I do not mean something 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.290
 material but to situations to events to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 specific things 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.540
 and this connects a lot with what 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.120
 we talked last Thursday with with trying 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.170
 that more and more we can do the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.460
 things that give us pleasure the things that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.320
 that connect us 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.680
 with our essence with what we have 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.510
 come to do with what 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.660
 with what we want to do 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.290
 and the truth that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460
 the impulse that I have that makes me 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.840
 contact me if you come to 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.640
 write and what else are in contact 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.500
 it's something that has to do with sharing 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.700
 and mainly it's something that has to 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.700
 see with my need 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.100
 with the need of 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.740
 to search 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.890
 with a need in that search and 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.680
 finding things 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.709
 finding a teaching finding 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.319
 certainties finding insecurities 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.180
 finding fears and from that 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.870
 all that is happening and sharing it with 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.329
 you that need to share not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.630
 it has to do with a question of ego and 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.450
 vanity 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 but rather with a question of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.450
 need 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.879
 the contribution that you make of the other 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.890
 side because that contribution is the one that 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.370
 It helps to reflect still more 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.069
 understands is not that I consider myself 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.760
 I am a kind of search guru 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.549
 of the human being I am a guy that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.299
 found this resource to be able to do 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.250
 my spiritual search that is not even more 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.170
 or less to understand every day a 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.740
 little bit more life to be able 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.290
 take advantage of the time that is going on 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.660
 another thing that spoke with manuel 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.060
 just here I send a human hug 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.599
 Dear 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.599
 is that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.970
 that we can be 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.220
 more and more I wrote it in its own time 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.480
 again connected to this I 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.040
 what we have to do 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.769
 all the moments that have to do 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.810
 with the anguish I think they have to 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.340
 see when we do not go much further 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.010
 of what we are seeing now 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.710
 when we are waiting for the best of 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.660
 something that happened and that distresses us 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.790
 It eats us up and makes us go crazy 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.660
 or to the bus that maybe we have to 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:37.660
 happen in an uncertain future not then 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.030
 really, we are more and more 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.530
 connected with now because now is the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.220
 only possibility we have of changing 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.080
 the oceans 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.990
 I could not the past and modify anything 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.930
 nor could the future and make any change 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.570
 so that what lives after is not so 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.940
 terrible or not so uncomfortable then 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.060
 the only time we have today is the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.750
 yesterday's future 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.919
 so that we live now we are 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.600
 pending what happens to us now 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.730
 because that's the only way we have 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.820
 we can change power 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:14.400
 change to me I love this contact 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:17.160
 we have and I assure you that 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.320
 I'm not clear about where this is going 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.330
 what we do what I have in mind is 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.610
 I'm enjoying it and I 'm enjoying it 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.590
 enjoying is fine and in the moment in 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.240
 the one that I do not want to enjoy it 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.520
 I will try to find ways to 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.780
 to be able to continue enjoying it and have to 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.220
 see purely and exclusively with the 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.380
 feeling that I have while I do it 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.530
 neither more nor less has nothing to do 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.470
 with no other question does everything happen to me 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.039
 what happens to be romantic with my 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.210
 work does not happen to me with any other 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.699
 work that I do need the encouragement the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.590
 inner urge to be able to do it and 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.449
 I can do it well if it does not cost me much 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.910
 pretend something that is not happening to me 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.280
 that's why he will thank you all 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.800
 you are on the other side sharing 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.419
 the evils that I'm going to confess to you 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.389
 I was drinking mate for a while and 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:09.620
 already the water was half the temperature of 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.620
 air but I started to drink hot mate 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.110
 so well I wanted to share a while 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.110
 with you we took some mates 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:27.529
 she is the only one known in a terry 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:29.569
 for he knows her falls in love she is with 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.759
 we do how much love can we 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.439
 damaris is the same is not spoken when 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.749
 also about eight years ago we have it 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:37.500
 a little bit after we had it 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.840
 altar 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.730
 she for example sleeps all night 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.660
 from above in our bed the moment 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:48.360
 that we cut off the supplies because they already 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.100
 saved but is there with us and 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.750
 coincidentally at the same time 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.060
 video appeared so I surely had 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.520
 to present it good hopefully they have 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.840
 a good day next Thursday we 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.100
 let's meet again in this way 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.500
 we will see what happens in that 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.720
 then I send them a big hug and 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.570
 I hope everyone is having a good time 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.900
 day and have a good life now 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.900
 they are god
