I<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.939> prefer<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.449> brush<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.779> hair<00:00:27.810> when

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I don't prefer to brush my hair when

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.960 
I don't prefer to brush my hair when
it's<00:00:28.260> curly<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> find<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
it's curly because I find that it

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
it's curly because I find that it
frizzes<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.660> when<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.109> wet<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.349> easily

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
frizzes up and when it's wet and easily

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
frizzes up and when it's wet and easily
breaks<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.420> even<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
breaks so I just don't even like to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
breaks so I just don't even like to
touch<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> brushed<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> beforehand<00:00:35.579> so

apple<00:05:17.639> blossom<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.090> bamboo<00:05:18.479> so<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:19.110> think<00:05:19.440> it's

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
apple blossom and bamboo so I think it's

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230 
apple blossom and bamboo so I think it's
the<00:05:19.680> Apple<00:05:20.039> that<00:05:20.160> makes<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.490> smell<00:05:20.699> so<00:05:20.760> good

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the Apple that makes it smell so good

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.300 
the Apple that makes it smell so good
but<00:05:21.870> this<00:05:22.050> is<00:05:22.169> just<00:05:22.199> going<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.560> help<00:05:22.770> add<00:05:22.979> some

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
but this is just going to help add some

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.920 
but this is just going to help add some
volume<00:05:23.460> because<00:05:23.940> when<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:24.510> add<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.690> lot<00:05:24.870> of

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
volume because when you add a lot of

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.050 
volume because when you add a lot of
curl<00:05:25.260> products<00:05:25.620> they<00:05:25.770> tend<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.250> kind<00:05:26.460> of<00:05:26.639> make

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
curl products they tend to kind of make

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.450 
curl products they tend to kind of make
your<00:05:27.210> hair<00:05:27.360> kind<00:05:27.570> of<00:05:27.630> go<00:05:27.750> down<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:29.070> your<00:05:29.190> curls

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
your hair kind of go down and your curls

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.510 
your hair kind of go down and your curls
dry<00:05:29.699> kind<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.060> like<00:05:30.150> look<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:31.080> I<00:05:31.110> like<00:05:31.470> to

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
looks like when it has dried a little

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.920 
looks like when it has dried a little
bit<00:06:48.870> i<00:06:52.460> just<00:06:53.460> realized<00:06:53.790> that<00:06:54.090> my<00:06:54.270> hair<00:06:54.510> dries

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
bit i just realized that my hair dries

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.050 
bit i just realized that my hair dries
really<00:06:55.260> slow<00:06:55.920> so<00:06:56.250> it's<00:06:56.610> probably<00:06:56.790> not<00:06:57.030> the

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
really slow so it's probably not the

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.490 
really slow so it's probably not the
smartest<00:06:57.150> idea<00:06:57.570> for<00:06:57.750> me<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:57.870> wait<00:06:58.230> that<00:06:58.440> long

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
smartest idea for me to wait that long

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.740 
smartest idea for me to wait that long
because<00:06:58.920> i<00:06:59.280> don't<00:06:59.730> know<00:06:59.760> how<00:06:59.910> long<00:07:00.180> it's<00:07:00.600> going

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
because i don't know how long it's going

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.480 
because i don't know how long it's going
to<00:07:00.840> be<00:07:01.020> it<00:07:01.080> will<00:07:01.260> probably<00:07:01.470> be<00:07:01.740> like<00:07:02.040> dark<00:07:02.340> out

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
to be it will probably be like dark out

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.450 
to be it will probably be like dark out
now<00:07:02.520> so<00:07:03.300> i'm<00:07:04.110> just<00:07:04.170> going<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.680> end<00:07:05.190> this<00:07:05.280> video

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
now so i'm just going to end this video

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.840
