Angelyn<00:02:22.860> after<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.470> level<00:02:26.060> began<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
Angelyn after that the level began to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.050 
Angelyn after that the level began to
fall<00:02:27.990> upper<00:02:28.770> part<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> fuel<00:02:29.430> rods<00:02:29.700> were

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
fall upper part of the fuel rods were

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.309 
fall upper part of the fuel rods were
exposed<00:02:32.390> receivers<00:02:33.390> at<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> time<00:02:34.170> of

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
exposed receivers at the time of

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.980 
exposed receivers at the time of
explosion<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.610> no<00:02:35.790> doubt<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.600> the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
explosion there was no doubt that the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.580 
explosion there was no doubt that the
radiation<00:02:37.260> level<00:02:37.740> rose<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.110> began<00:02:40.380> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
radiation level rose that it began to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.540 
radiation level rose that it began to
fall<00:02:41.190> after<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.590> impact<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.190> human

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
fall after that so the impact on human

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.040 
fall after that so the impact on human
health<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:46.170> considered<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.860> very<00:02:46.950> low

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
health is considered to be very low

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.590 
health is considered to be very low
right<00:02:49.050> now<00:02:50.959> we<00:02:51.959> need<00:02:52.319> now<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.370> everybody<00:02:54.209> to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
right now we need now for everybody to

so<00:03:49.290> they<00:03:49.470> pressure<00:03:49.709> india<00:03:50.340> suppression

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
so they pressure india suppression

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.140 
so they pressure india suppression
chamber<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:52.410> told<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:53.100> be<00:03:53.579> going<00:03:53.940> down

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.650 

following<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.359> blast<00:03:58.430> so<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.359> assume

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
following the blast so we can assume
