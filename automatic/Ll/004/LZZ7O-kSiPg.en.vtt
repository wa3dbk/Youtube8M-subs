 Romeritos that is not the same as the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.150
 rosemary

 moment they are cleaning well because 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.190

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.880
 little apple cider vinegar goes that 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.490
 it stays for a short time it is a 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.440
