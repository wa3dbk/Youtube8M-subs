00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 and we're back with a new and 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.900
 plÃ©lo way warcraft alliance versus horde 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 in spawn on the bottom left 2 h or soft 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.480
 we find virlay players 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 waterfall without guys playing on time 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.830
 current allianz is at the top right on the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 player at shops in horde 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 so I already made a first replay 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 domois played by these same players 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.820
 do not hesitate to go checkbook it goes 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.140
 cost him a lot of explanations but 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 also to continue explanations on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.170
 the knowledge I have in my game 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 to know well I played half a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.969
 dozen of game and I watched a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 other half dozen so I'm very 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.559
 very far from knowing everything about this game because 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.200
 it is very complete and this game is not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 finished this game is not balanced but this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 game is really nice so here is me 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.239
 I comment on the whole of a bo3 and you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 tell me what you think 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 and how do you want to handle it here in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.579
 all the cases here chouf that does the same 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 or rather sooner song that does the same 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.430
 thing that in the previous range 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.899
 in the range presents all the toys 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.979
 horde he had laid two barracks and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.130
 that's exactly what it is 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.840
 doing it's there he's promoting his 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 units production with very quickly 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.420
 of barak so that at the level of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 resource stock 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.780
 well he is right now 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 lower than his opponent and I do not 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 somehow its macro is better 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.229
 the problem is that in war you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 are not in like in warcraft where 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.650
 you are really going to have a worry of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 spend your resources not to be 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.549
 late what's going to be a factor 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 xp of your heroes is going to be a factor 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 of two numbers and micro management 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 much more important and so that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.009
 you have a little more 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 resources that your opponent or even 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.560
 many more resources than your 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.360
 adversary that you do not spend 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.250
 necessarily it 'll have a lesser 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.200
 impact here song who like linghem 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.450
 present will go xp very early however 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 attention he has relatively little unity 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 and decided to make the wine dike wrongly 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 like hero so aero kit that I do not 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.090
 do not know and who therefore has a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.710
 care spell it's relatively 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.540
 interesting he also pulled out a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.670
 priestess for care and he took out 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.649
 two infantry for the king time as well 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.329
 a little droid for the dps on 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.310
 continues to come out of the hours islands of the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.479
 side of the day alliance side of the day 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.360
 off the property we also left 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.310
 to talk with like heroes also 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.760
 that he's a neutral hero and that's the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.640
 fender king so who for now at a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.170
 fate that makes stations reduces the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.610
 moving speed and the speed 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.000
 attack so when we go out relatively 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.300
 nice to watch here by going a little 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.769
 one were bug on bolt louis which was at 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.510
 big there so be careful of 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.000
 do not have a big big creep groups 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.200
 since lee did that he pursues 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360
 however still long enough 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.460
 it's also related to the fact that the map and 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.600
 relationship 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.090
 finally the maps as a whole are 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.320
 relatively small or videos of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.140
 moving 130 I do not know 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.530
 finally there are the workers who are 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.430
 extremely slow with 1.9 speed 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.460
 displacement while most of 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.820
 obscenities are at 3.5 3,75 this kind of 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.050
 little greedy here they are here 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.370
 the two days that freed the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.810
 therefore potentially exporting who 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.100
 could see his expand on horseback 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.170
 the experts are much more 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.570
 available only on pink butt since 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.160
 the expo is literally in the exit 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.750
 from your base 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.520
 while crossroads they are going to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.500
 find more in corners 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.850
 completely eccentric and defended by 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.210
 many many creatures of very 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.680
 high level 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.390
 you can not pick up before 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.100
 a certain time this being said as 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.070
 I stated in the previous ai replay 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.920
 well we take relatively little exposure 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.420
 angoua at least at the moment 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.100
 because it's hard to actually 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.960
 ask your building and defend it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.510
 this is what is particular and 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.740
 defense turrets but that's enough 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.030
 it's hard to do and if we go 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.650
 have once again the commitment of the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.360
 two players a commitment a 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.670
 commitment of both players at the level of 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
 middle of map in the previous replay 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.670
 had done the same thing at about 5 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.260
 minutes of play also to arrive in the middle 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.060
 he had started beating himself for 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.350
 middle monsters it's usually this 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 who bought it bigger treasure and its 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.050
 waters in the wrong cheek that's all 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.590
 more interesting than you have 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.490
 normally the fountains here so I 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.800
 do not know exactly where they are 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.330
 but it seems to me that this is the 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.000
 fountain simply and art and 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.020
 generates health points to units that 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.940
 is next door so it's interesting 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.070
 we have control 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.530
 at least to be assured that she is 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.440
 cleaned to be able to heal 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.140
 wish for his income 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.600
 Be careful not to forget them 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.890
 on the return the hero of his here from 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.340
 time a lot of damage be careful not to 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.500
 not lose it 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.270
 there is a small focus in general 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.260
 of the hero of his finally on the 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.630
 troops from his missile that will arrive 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.280
 with the druids that sway the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.230
 fairy lights to reduce to armor 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.080
 aortic units a lot of ideas 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.090
 who die on the side of white cabbage with 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.680
 a lower agricultural population of 11 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.410
 also note the progression is 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.860
 significantly less time to rise to be 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.160
 less in this day it's spell first 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.680
 the fate of the thunder king who 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.510
 allows to put a kind of area 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.190
 of effect for a while it's 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.840
 not bad the really the whole game 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.270
 is very complete there has been a lot 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.340
 of inventiveness especially at the level of the neck 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.430
 capabilities of the units but also 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.070
 at the level of the heroes use even if they 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.160
 are more or less all based on 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.950
 models of warcraft 2 2 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.820
 as would say world of warcraft as 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.230
 you can see it with the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.620
 incantations of spells that you will 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.600
 familiar 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.580
 if you ever play the famous 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.490
 mmorpg of them are here goes the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.280
 look for the satyrs that are the enough 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.570
 fearsome must say it with when 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.220
 even 125 of snow 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.900
 every five seconds and 4 to 10 april 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.760
 all in all it's a here it's when 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.640
 even a group of creatures relatively 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720
 to the powerful but its that should be 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.620
 go out a priori these micro manages 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.330
 correctly he will still lose a 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.980
 infantryman here I am the one who goes to 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.350
 beyond it will happen for them also 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.240
 typed and low blow are who is going to have to 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.940
 to be forced to give up treasures 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.220
 behind and that's pretty serious since 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.070
 blow he lost May 18 to steal his 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.540
 treasure is here is little for the 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.910
 chopper and even the same let the 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.160
 bigger it pulls us so still 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.690
 a lot of xp that will not come back to him if 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.660
 we look at the table of resources 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.510
 lost song who is behind one in the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.800
 sense where he is late but next to 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.180
 what to see what is less 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.270
 that in the previous range and here the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.640
 satyr that cost units to our at 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.930
 our good shoot 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.700
 so it's equivalent to that 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.990
 I would like to do that then I was doing that 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.820
 try to get back to his base by the way 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.930
 by this group of units unfortunately s 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.800
 who am not sure they have 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.660
 enough dps 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.750
 he has a lot of hiller but here he has that 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.120
 two or three 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.590
 improvement shaman for the dps on 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.030
 to another who will arrive here but from 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.440
 shot that is completely isolated and that 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.050
 die very quickly 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.270
 the monsters are really powerful or 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.280
 and palmer take a piece of her fender 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.960
 king who will die and who will pass 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.580
 attack directly on the basis of 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.480
 things and there is no defense 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.340
 does the volume bear it's going to be 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.810
 used I do not know lol I 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.300
 actually it seemed pretty 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.070
 difficult to defend here so it was 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.260
 replays number 2 from wau on 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:08.110
