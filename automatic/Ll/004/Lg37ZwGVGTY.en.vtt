00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.749 
as well okay see er we're in the jacket
we've<00:06:42.879> got<00:06:43.090> hair<00:06:43.629> on<00:06:43.750> the<00:06:43.840> outside<00:06:44.759> got

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
we've got hair on the outside got

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:52.920 
we've got hair on the outside got
zippered<00:06:46.180> pockets<00:06:48.930> right<00:06:49.930> here<00:06:51.479> the<00:06:52.479> pocket

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
zippered pockets right here the pocket

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.629 
zippered pockets right here the pocket
that<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.229> see<00:06:53.470> right<00:06:53.620> here<00:06:53.830> it<00:06:54.009> does<00:06:54.159> not<00:06:54.190> have<00:06:54.610> a

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
that I see right here it does not have a

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.999 
that I see right here it does not have a
waterproof<00:06:55.389> zipper<00:06:56.080> on<00:06:56.289> it<00:06:56.319> so<00:06:56.590> I'm<00:06:56.650> guessing

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:57.009 
waterproof zipper on it so I'm guessing

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.520 
waterproof zipper on it so I'm guessing
those<00:06:57.129> are<00:06:57.310> water-resistant<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:58.780> these

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
those are water-resistant and these

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.869 
those are water-resistant and these
outer<00:06:59.740> pockets<00:07:00.220> are<00:07:00.340> probably<00:07:00.669> not

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 
outer pockets are probably not

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.879 
outer pockets are probably not
completely<00:07:01.720> waterproof<00:07:01.960> so<00:07:02.650> I<00:07:02.680> would

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
completely waterproof so I would

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.290 
completely waterproof so I would
encourage<00:07:03.129> any<00:07:03.430> documents<00:07:03.940> or<00:07:04.000> anything<00:07:04.150> you
