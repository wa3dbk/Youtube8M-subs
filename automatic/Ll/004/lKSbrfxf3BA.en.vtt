something like that I look at it as a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
something like that I look at it as a
way<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.440> becoming<00:00:16.680> more<00:00:17.100> who<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.369> am<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:18.270> I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
way of becoming more who I am like I

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.120 
way of becoming more who I am like I
express<00:00:18.869> myself<00:00:19.050> literally<00:00:19.590> threw<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> game
