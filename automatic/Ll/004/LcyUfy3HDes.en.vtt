00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
further ado let's rip open this package

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.340 
further ado let's rip open this package
and<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.559> hope<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.980> didn't<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.430> ripped<00:00:47.670> off

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
if that was supposed to if that was the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.870 
if that was supposed to if that was the
idea<00:03:03.810> behind<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.769> people<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.489> made<00:03:05.670> this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
idea behind the people that made this

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.759 
idea behind the people that made this
but<00:03:06.150> that's<00:03:06.450> kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.930> cool<00:03:06.989> we<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.319> have

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
but that's kind of cool we don't have

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.580 
but that's kind of cool we don't have
one<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.069> those<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:10.519> believe<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:13.440> is

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
one of those and believe this is this is

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.509 
one of those and believe this is this is
Odin<00:03:14.120> Odin<00:03:15.120> from<00:03:15.420> from<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> Thor<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:17.310> Thor

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.800 
movies I think it's what this guy is
based<00:03:20.310> off<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:20.910> we<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.269> don't<00:03:21.359> think<00:03:21.630> we've

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
based off of so we I don't think we've

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.340 
based off of so we I don't think we've
ever<00:03:21.989> gotten

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
ever gotten

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.059
