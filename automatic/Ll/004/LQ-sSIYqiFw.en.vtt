00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:23.579
 there is such a question why is this 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.390
 Well first women and iron sport 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.849
 these are two very good things 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.860
 matching 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.070
 First here are the lessons so that's 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.190
 power sports all kinds of projectiles 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.080
 horizontal bars antennas barbells first 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.880
 they contribute to weight loss ie they 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:53.820
 keep the shape toned do not give does not give you 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.130
 gain extra calories and well that 's 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.400
 the word bodybuilding itself is a system 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.079
 building a body that is it can 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.850
 build as you are 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.070
 imagine it doesn't have to be 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 there is a woman a girl there soon developed 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.480
 musculature 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.730
 this is body building 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.630
 that is, as a result of classes you can 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:23.680
 get a shape that you 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.680
 suitable which 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.460
 squatting is one of the best exercises 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.870
 I would say even the best to keep 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.090
 muscle tone well i mean 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.530
 squats may well build 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.890
 beautiful legs 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 squats well maybe not the most 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 heavy 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:57.030
 but none the less so 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:00.830
 proven and reliable ways and see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.830
 his pants are not afraid of everything 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.750
 scissors but often 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.800
 performed by a barbell well so as not to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.890
 load your back 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 things can be done well 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.140
 antennas are one of the best exercises 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.030
 for thigh and gluteus muscles also 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.489
 This is such a simple exercise. 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.150
 quite simple it gives good 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.880
 working on these muscles 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 exercise can be attributed to 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.209
 multi-articular it loads a little 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.320
 hip a little load on the back 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:49.170
 gluteal muscles are so simple 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:51.819
 exercises will help you keep in shape 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.920
 these are the most problematic places 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:00.720
 which are considered such problems in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.720
 women and see they are more efficient 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.489
 pulling up on the horizontal bar but usually 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.989
 girls don't like this exercise very much 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.760
 considering it too labors in general is 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.750
 one of these is the most proven 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.849
 good exercises for the shoulder girdle 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.849
 back muscles and system 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.610
 learning to pull up is not so difficult 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:42.300
 usually girls are afraid of such physical 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:47.290
 strength exercises motivating it so that 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:51.660
 they will grow the muscles of female physiology 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.660
 she is a little different than men 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.870
 become what you could for a long time 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.920
 pull up here look not from her 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.260
 massive keys 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.260
 massive circle here is the most common hand 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:13.330
 this is a good exercise do not need to be afraid 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.810
 such sports equipment one more 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.130
 exercise bench press 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.130
 well, this is such an easy exercise 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.770
 usually girls are afraid of doing it too 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.220
 but this is a very good exercise for 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:44.909
 to save or even create a new one 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.909
 cut form 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:56.710
 This is a classic weight selection individually 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.900
 Well, of course if you do not put in front 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.509
 a champion goals you can perform 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.110
 two three approaches 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:11.979
 one more exercise here breeding 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:14.069
 dumbbell lying down it as an additive to the press 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.069
 rods 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:25.770
 also very good exercises that 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.770
 depending on the method of execution 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.930
 gives the load either on top 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.900
 either on the lower chest 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.750
 these exercises do not usually have to be afraid 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.639
 those girls are afraid but such exercises are not 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.639
 can ruin the shape of the breast 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.469
 on the contrary , toned muscles 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.300
 will give a very good shape 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:07.770
 barbell squats perhaps this 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.740
 This is a good exercise for the muscles. 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.040
 thighs despite their seeming 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.040
 simplicity 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.410
 here also has its own technique 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:29.040
 we do not seek to show the championship 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:34.020
 the results ie the pressure is not so 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.500
 completely full to us the main thing to give the load 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.500
 muscles keep them toned 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.500
 to work 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:49.009
 that is, this is such a simple exercise 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:57.149
 which girls usually don't like very much 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:07:00.119
 do exercises with a barbell but 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:04.799
 no less in spite of her simplicity she 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:12.839
 gives great results to perform better 

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:16.519
 in 2 3 approach when lowering you need to do 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:18.899
 inhale when lifting you need to exhale 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:21.559
 back you need to keep so little 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.559
 arched 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.960
 squats on one leg but this is not 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.800
 easy exercise as it seems at first 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.949
 At first glance itâ€™s still pretty 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.250
 difficult because you have to lift 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:48.889
 total body weight but this need 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:53.419
 keep balance is good 

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:56.750
 exercise for thigh muscles such here 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:59.389
 simple exercises help to keep 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.669
 muscles in tone you can squat first 

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.669
 holding on to what any of it 

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.930
 gradually drawing less and less 

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.260
 you learn to squat squat on 

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.260
 one leg
