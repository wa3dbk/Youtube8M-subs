00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello here sarah jane and today would like 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.069
 I invited you over the addon for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.469
 Diablo 3 you know, however 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.389
 what's up is good last one is a little 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.119
 addon what a sound signal plays when 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.270
 you a legendary or others 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.830
 Items found in Diablo 3's 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 of course a great advantage for people 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 just by and where the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.529
 monster dying behind one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 so you can never be important again 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 miss another 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 Of course, now the question arises 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.340
 this program is allowed blizzard 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.620
 basically forbids programs 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 Third, I have many support tickets 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 found on the internet wherever the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.840
 standard answer came yes we refer 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 on our rules and programs third 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.090
 are strictly forbidden and lead 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 to have one after some support ticket 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 I then have a special support ticket 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.020
 found 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.840
 I would like to show you this once 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.449
 marc niki lenses if Luther ps he 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.119
 justifies his question that he 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.430
 has bad eyesight and this program 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 Helping them with this helps them last 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 davis and normal items better too 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 recognize or find 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 In addition, he also says that this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 program no files changed after two 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.840
 about days had an answer 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 only get from us and he is writing 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 Enke in front of contacts blizzard 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:43.229
 entertainment web experience in the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 automotive now comes the important thing 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 completely ok to use that does not mean 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 that's not looking for yourself 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.460
 to users like that 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 What exactly does that mean in the end 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.050
 he really writes it's okay this 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.640
 program and he can safely 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.800
 that he is not banished 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.040
 Now my question to you what do you think 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.420
 you think that's okay 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.460
 to use this program 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 I know that blizzard in the next one 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.640
 patch a similar one similar 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.930
 function will install 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.490
 just write under the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.960
 Comment if you own this 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.670
 program uses whether we may already 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.450
 was banned or if you know people 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.430
 who was banned 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.140
 I'd really interested I 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.980
 I would not like to say anything now 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.040
 whether it is allowed or not everyone has to 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.090
 to decide for yourself 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 and I'm looking forward to yours 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 comments and see you tomorrow 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.320
