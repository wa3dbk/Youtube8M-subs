ship<00:01:07.210> oh<00:01:08.160> yeah<00:01:09.160> perfect<00:01:09.580> exactly<00:01:10.510> where<00:01:10.690> I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
ship oh yeah perfect exactly where I

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.840 
ship oh yeah perfect exactly where I
wanted<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.170> anyway<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:12.520> update<00:01:12.640> they

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.460 
wanted it anyway so in this update they
made<00:01:13.270> paintable<00:01:13.600> blog<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.080> can<00:01:14.229> pay<00:01:14.350> your

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
made paintable blog so you can pay your

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.870 
made paintable blog so you can pay your
engine<00:01:14.740> blocks<00:01:15.010> anything<00:01:15.460> else<00:01:15.580> which<00:01:15.729> is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
engine blocks anything else which is

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.520 
engine blocks anything else which is
pretty<00:01:16.030> interesting<00:01:16.210> but<00:01:16.960> that's<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.320> going

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
pretty interesting but that's not going

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.380 
pretty interesting but that's not going
if<00:01:17.680> we're<00:01:17.890> here<00:01:17.979> for<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.190> ship<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:19.240> think

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
if we're here for the ship and I think

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.050 
if we're here for the ship and I think
that's<00:01:19.540> great<00:01:19.660> bunny<00:01:19.810> okay<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.700> have<00:01:21.910> all

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
that's great bunny okay so we have all

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.749 
that's great bunny okay so we have all
these<00:01:22.180> verse<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.080> rotors<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.520> rotors<00:01:24.520> here

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
these verse the rotors that rotors here

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.010 
these verse the rotors that rotors here
so<00:01:25.060> we're<00:01:25.210> going<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.420> hit<00:01:25.570> them<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.899> other

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
so we're going to hit them to the other

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.900 
so we're going to hit them to the other
opposite<00:01:26.410> way<00:01:27.630> negative<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.490> one's<00:01:30.729> gonna

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
opposite way negative this one's gonna

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.779 
opposite way negative this one's gonna
be<00:01:31.030> positive<00:01:31.440> so<00:01:32.440> no<00:01:32.830> that's<00:01:33.190> cool

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
be positive so no that's cool

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.300 
be positive so no that's cool
so<00:01:34.539> we<00:01:34.660> have<00:01:34.810> our<00:01:35.110> openings<00:01:36.009> hopefully<00:01:36.250> you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
so we have our openings hopefully you

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.990 
so we have our openings hopefully you
know<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:37.770> guess<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:39.039> don't<00:01:39.190> know<00:01:39.310> what<00:01:39.430> that<00:01:39.550> it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
know I guess I don't know what that it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.930 
know I guess I don't know what that it
does<00:01:40.149> for<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.420> ship<00:01:40.600> or<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> space<00:01:41.110> shuttle

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
does for the ship or the space shuttle

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.859 
does for the ship or the space shuttle
but<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.000> gotta<00:01:43.149> say<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.450> pretty<00:01:43.479> instant

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
but I gotta say it's pretty instant

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.029 
but I gotta say it's pretty instant
let's<00:01:44.020> go<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.289> walk<00:01:44.440> around<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.770> check<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
let's go and walk around and check that

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.300 
let's go and walk around and check that
out<00:01:45.100> go<00:01:45.340> fast<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> lot<00:01:47.080> more<00:01:47.110> light<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:48.070> able

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
out go fast so a lot more light is able

a meteor speed or tricking my heart so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.370 
a meteor speed or tricking my heart so
left<00:02:07.810> or<00:02:07.960> right

left or right

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.720 
left or right
good<00:02:08.770> choice<00:02:09.010> between<00:02:09.220> left<00:02:09.640> ah<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.890> non-safe

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
good choice between left ah a non-safe

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.820 
good choice between left ah a non-safe
room<00:02:13.410> doors<00:02:19.020> that's<00:02:20.020> beautiful

so<00:02:21.220> there<00:02:21.430> are<00:02:21.550> three<00:02:21.880> modes<00:02:22.060> with<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
so there are three modes with the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
so there are three modes with the
meteors<00:02:22.900> there's<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.440> think<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.740> like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
meteors there's I think it's like

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.160 
meteors there's I think it's like
realistic<00:02:24.910> Armageddon<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.540> sort<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.780> medium

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
realistic Armageddon and sort of medium

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.740 
realistic Armageddon and sort of medium
ish<00:02:26.470> low<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.730> there's<00:02:28.000> also<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.210> long<00:02:28.360> force

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
ish low and there's also a long force

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.220 
ish low and there's also a long force
and<00:02:30.000> my<00:02:31.000> home<00:02:31.180> know<00:02:31.300> why<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.600> my<00:02:31.630> meteors<00:02:32.020> are

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and my home know why but my meteors are

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.350 
and my home know why but my meteors are
all<00:02:33.000> squared

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
