00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
version there is a normal version out

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.470 
version there is a normal version out
there<00:00:45.129> they<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.610> blu-ray<00:00:45.879> with<00:00:46.120> the

there they have a blu-ray with the

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.080 
there they have a blu-ray with the
normal<00:00:46.780> blu-ray<00:00:47.080> version<00:00:47.260> but<00:00:47.860> I<00:00:48.160> figured<00:00:49.000> go

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
normal blu-ray version but I figured go

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.880 
normal blu-ray version but I figured go
to<00:00:49.390> go<00:00:49.510> for<00:00:49.720> this<00:00:49.809> one<00:00:49.870> because<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.559> me<00:00:50.710> this

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
to go for this one because to me this

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.060 
to go for this one because to me this
movie<00:00:51.270> should<00:00:52.270> be<00:00:52.329> viewed<00:00:52.720> in<00:00:52.930> 3d<00:00:53.380> it<00:00:53.649> was<00:00:53.860> made

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
movie should be viewed in 3d it was made

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.770 
movie should be viewed in 3d it was made
in<00:00:54.250> three<00:00:54.520> so<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.850> think<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.180> should<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.420> viewed

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
in three so I think it should be viewed

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.970 
in three so I think it should be viewed
in<00:00:55.930> 3d<00:00:56.290> um<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:58.630> I<00:00:58.719> don't<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.079> 3d<00:00:59.440> TV<00:00:59.620> which

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
in 3d um and I don't have a 3d TV which

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.220 
in 3d um and I don't have a 3d TV which
kind<00:01:00.219> of<00:01:00.250> sucks<00:01:00.579> but<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:00.969> figured<00:01:01.390> by<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:02.020> now

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
kind of sucks but I figured by this now

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.290 
kind of sucks but I figured by this now
and<00:01:02.559> then<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.680> know<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> future<00:01:03.300> I'll

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
and then you know in the future I'll

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.130 
and then you know in the future I'll
probably<00:01:04.540> get<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.780> 3d<00:01:05.110> TV<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.670> anyways<00:01:06.970> uh<00:01:07.330> this
