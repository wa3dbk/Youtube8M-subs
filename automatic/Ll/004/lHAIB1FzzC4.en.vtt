00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630

 although swu 8.2 is also in phase 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 beta this did not stop the apple 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.349
 also to launch a new version of the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630
 new swu 8.3 beta already finds

 register for google accounts there are also 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 rumors that Apple will launch a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.390
 new version of swu 8.4 after the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.140
 launch of ep watch and s 8.2 for the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.500
 public 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.570
 second night makes mec wes 8.4 will have a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 new streaming music service from 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.690
 own apple 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.270
 but does not stop there at night makes mec 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.789
 also reported that s9 will focus on 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 stability system fixes all 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.570
 apple launches a new iof for the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.619
 and this year will not be very 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 different 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 however the focus of this new s9 would not be 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 news but rather a great better 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 performance and stability in the system 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.720
 whenever Apple launches a new swimsuit it is 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 if she focuses more news and goes 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 completing over time your system 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 mobile operation but this time it 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.650
 can do a little different 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590
 thinking about stability and performance 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.600
 as priority number one of s 9 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.159
 but do not worry because apple should 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 also launch news for the new 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 system since of course it always launches a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 range of news in these large versions 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.439
 and now talking about something well 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 interesting to discover a car with 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.619
 street view cameras on the streets of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.780
 new york 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 however rented by the apple itself this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.590
 suggests that apple may be bringing the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 3d view of the street view for your 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.570
 native map application but the way 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 same people is waiting and now talking 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.009
 on the iphone 6 s to new rumors of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.890
 that the iphone 6 s will have tank improver 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.479
 your fingerprint sensor 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.509
 leaving it far more polished to self 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.360
 pilot your payment system on fc o 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
 trade of the iphone 6s be equipped with a 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.050
 new recognition module 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.460
 digital fingerprint by making it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.740
 be safer and better reducing 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.930
 on sensor reading errors like you 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.730
 already know I have an iphone 6 and also 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.770
 I had the iphone 5 s 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.570
 both clear with the tutti id in the first 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.470
 week I used the toxoid 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.670
 iphone 6 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.220
 I had already noticed a large 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.560
 improvement and to this day I am satisfied 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.300
 also clear using the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 tank to be for online shopping 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.440
 how to unlock the device 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.480
 honestly I do not see what it takes to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.700
 improve the touch and current of the iphone 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.500
 6 is already practically perfect and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 he hardly recognizes mine. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.710
 fingerprint 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.240
 but anyway it's worth remembering that all this for 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.190
 while it's just a rumor 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.810
 good staff but that's it who liked the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.880
 like video who is not subscribed to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.740
 channel click sign up and also short 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.420
 your facebook page and do not follow the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.010
 twitter on instagram because this is personal 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.570
 It will help a lot, but even here. 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.730
 with the disclosure of the channel 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.130
 I wish you both a great week and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.700
 People see in the next video here was still 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.700
 more mine
