the<00:01:54.900> hardpoint<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.590> come<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.010> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the hardpoint is gonna come over here in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.070 
the hardpoint is gonna come over here in
this<00:01:56.400> room<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.700> he's<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.900> few

this room that he's in here in a few

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.280 
this room that he's in here in a few
minutes<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.740> decides<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.840> go<00:02:00.840> ahead<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
minutes so he decides to go ahead just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.930 
minutes so he decides to go ahead just
stay<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:01.710> pick<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.220> few<00:02:02.430> kills<00:02:02.670> because

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
stay in here pick up a few kills because

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.180 
stay in here pick up a few kills because
his<00:02:03.510> enemies<00:02:03.900> are<00:02:04.080> obviously<00:02:04.530> coming<00:02:04.830> towards

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
his enemies are obviously coming towards

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.640 
his enemies are obviously coming towards
him<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.420> might<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.720> well<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.900> pick<00:02:07.530> up

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
him so you might as well just pick up

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.469 
him so you might as well just pick up
these<00:02:07.770> skills<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.909> when<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> hard<00:02:09.269> part

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
these skills and so when the hard part

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.149 
these skills and so when the hard part
comes<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:09.959> he<00:02:10.140> picks<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.769> 200

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
comes over here he picks up the 200

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.780 
comes over here he picks up the 200
points<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.410> that's<00:02:13.410> that's<00:02:14.130> easiest<00:02:14.580> way<00:02:14.730> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
points and that's that's easiest way to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.400 
points and that's that's easiest way to
get<00:02:14.910> those<00:02:15.090> killstreaks<00:02:15.600> gases<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> pick<00:02:16.290> up

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
get those killstreaks gases to pick up

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.080 
get those killstreaks gases to pick up
those<00:02:16.530> 200

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
those 200

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.559 
those 200
and<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.950> hard<00:02:19.160> point<00:02:19.430> kills<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.940> if<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.450> just

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
and get hard point kills and if you just

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.330 
and get hard point kills and if you just
do<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.019> will<00:02:21.050> get<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.769> strict<00:02:22.010> really

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
do this you will get so strict really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.220 
do this you will get so strict really
really<00:02:22.519> fast<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:23.239> really<00:02:24.050> really

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
really fast really really really

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.059 
really fast really really really
effective<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.099> you'll<00:02:25.970> just<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:27.590> rocking

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
effective and you'll just be rocking

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.190 
effective and you'll just be rocking
with<00:02:28.160> them<00:02:28.340> dogs<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.239> he<00:02:29.269> sees<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.930> have

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
with them dogs so he sees that they have

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.449 
with them dogs so he sees that they have
the<00:02:30.319> hard<00:02:30.500> part<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:30.830> he's<00:02:30.950> going<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.129> rush<00:02:31.430> down

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the hard part so he's going to rush down

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.080 
the hard part so he's going to rush down
here<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.330> pick<00:02:33.019> up<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.230> couple<00:02:33.349> kills<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.090> then

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
here and pick up a couple kills and then

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.270 
here and pick up a couple kills and then
now<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.900> get<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.200> over<00:02:36.379> with<00:02:36.530> Lisa<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.160> he

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
now you get this over with Lisa so he

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.400 
now you get this over with Lisa so he
picks<00:02:37.519> up<00:02:37.610> another<00:02:37.760> kill<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.540> then<00:02:39.200> another

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
picks up another kill and then another

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.589 
picks up another kill and then another
Cal<00:02:39.739> fourth<00:02:39.980> lodestar<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
Cal fourth lodestar and so that's just

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.150 
Cal fourth lodestar and so that's just
kind<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.110> little<00:02:42.140> bit<00:02:42.410> more<00:02:42.530> campy<00:02:42.980> ur<00:02:43.010> way

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
kind of a little bit more campy ur way

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.420 
kind of a little bit more campy ur way
to<00:02:43.220> get<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:44.090> kill<00:02:44.299> streak<00:02:44.569> in<00:02:44.959> nuketown<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
to get the kill streak in nuketown and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 
to get the kill streak in nuketown and
now<00:02:46.849> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.209> domination<00:02:47.599> this<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.110> not<00:02:48.379> hard

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
now this is domination this is not hard

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.030 
now this is domination this is not hard
point<00:02:49.160> no<00:02:49.280> more<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:50.049> domination<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.799> best

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
point no more so in domination the best

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.039 
point no more so in domination the best
thing<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:52.940> do<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:53.480> try<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.870> get

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
thing for you to do is to try to get

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.420 
thing for you to do is to try to get
capture<00:02:54.530> kills<00:02:54.739> captures<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:57.190> defends<00:02:58.190> and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
capture kills captures and defends and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.370 
capture kills captures and defends and
what<00:02:58.819> all<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.299> effort<00:02:59.540> stuff<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.290> helps

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
what all that effort stuff that helps

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.930 
what all that effort stuff that helps
you<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.799> little<00:03:01.160> more<00:03:01.250> points<00:03:01.579> than<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:01.849> a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you get a little more points than just a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.819 
you get a little more points than just a
regular<00:03:02.090> kill<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.930> let<00:03:03.049> me<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.260> picked<00:03:03.440> up<00:03:03.530> to

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
regular kill so let me just picked up to

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.170 
regular kill so let me just picked up to
capture<00:03:04.310> kills<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:04.849> he's<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.120> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
capture kills and then he's going to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.850 
capture kills and then he's going to
pick<00:03:05.360> up<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.629> capture<00:03:06.049> which<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.799> to
