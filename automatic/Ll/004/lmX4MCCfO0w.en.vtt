00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.190
 hi guys welcome to one more time to 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.840
 a guide 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.050
 continue with chapter number 5 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.439
 called warming up is in the first 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.770
 episode and to find the first eye 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.690
 it is precisely here where the washes 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.350
 we wet so that it becomes stone 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.040
 and we have to upload it with the pillar of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.250
 land 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.130
 up and grab the eye of this 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.810
 so I know how fast because if not 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.810
 returns to become the low 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 and here we have the eye 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.440
 well the second eye or evil in the secret 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.510
 is going to be on top 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.150
 we have to jump so that the screen 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.550
 take off a bit and you can grab it 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.220
 because they give something hidden 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.040
 the next eye is right here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.710
 is 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.950
 almost in advance we tear the first 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 eye you have to do it this way and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.570
 fast because the lava 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.860
 the water source and the next eye one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.120
 which is on the top for 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 to be able to get there you have to do this 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.130
 way this font we're going up 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 and the next one also so that we 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 I proposed here is hidden and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.920
 here we went up and here is going to open the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 screen and we have to grow a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.190
 root and a target to be able to cross and the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.190
 we put in this way to get there 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 and so we will not have this eye that at 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.100
 principle you can do is difficult 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.750
 and in the next under is visible in 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 the game in fact to get to the there that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.120
 do this with the stone and we arrived 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.250
 justly 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.349
 the next eye happens to be difficult but 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 the secret is to get on top 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.310
 of the target so that the screen is us 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.860
 take off and you can grow the other 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.099
 line that is up and so we are going to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.290
 get to the eye that looks like it's in a 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.579
 difficult to access but in this way it is 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.579
 how we got to him 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.090
 and so we come to our room and last 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.090
 episode eye 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.290
 in episode number 2 of chapter 5 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.420
 called the fire chamber what 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.730
 first let's find is going to be the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.000
 secret and it's right here when 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.140
 we started breaking the stones 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.660
 already home light and the secret is to knock down this 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.090
 peak or this stone wall to be able 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.360
 get on and jump to the left of 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.760
 where is it 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.950
 I get the power and here is a cave 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.780
 we went up and we entered here we are going to 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.780
 find what is the first secret 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.840
 good 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.850
 well to find what is the first 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.640
 eye of the episode since we study the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.090
 stone here we are going to fall and here we go 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 to win for the right side 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.010
 can correctly return for no 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.550
 confuse you have to duck us to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.150
 enter and we will find the first eye 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.150
 of the episode 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.850
 to grab the second eye can be a 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.590
 little laborious what we have to do 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.230
 is to go up here but it seems 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.770
 we have to help us with the root 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.850
 doing a kind of steps or a 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.239
 picture 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.230
 what makes it easier for them to cut it for 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.880
 who tells them and falls next to us and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.950
 what will help us climb so that 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.590
 the screen unfolds more towards 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.000
 up and be able to grow the font 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.000
 that appears 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.479
 as you will see since we are up here in 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.039
 the screen unfolds and now if 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:28.940
 we can go up we grow the root the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.370
 source we make you make a down turn 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.300
 up to be able 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.260
 to come take us and proposed us to the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.260
 eye and so we arrive 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.550
 to grab the second eye the one that 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.400
 was the top part what we have 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.740
 what to do is to knock down this pipe here 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.889
 in this way 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.750
 and here we have to agree not to leave 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.720
 fall to the left we have what 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.300
 that is a wall of earth we do this 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.039
 grow up now you can jump and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.810
 climb the stairs and we will get there 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.810
 directly the eye is not found 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.520
 well to grab the eye that is 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.680
 find here after 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.460
 let's destroy the guardians of mustache 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.910
 you have to remove it from the roots to 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.370
 to drag it and carry the one 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.500
 find the eye because it is something 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.490
 elevated and you have to destroy 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.250
 khoo boon with a square so that we 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.730
 let grow a root that will help us 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.730
 to climb 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.880
 and that's how we arrived and grabbed 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.880
 our last eye of the episode 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.210
 in chaos I hope he is here and I will 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.750
 had served them has been useful and if 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.710
 they liked you already know probably a line 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.289
 they share the two with their friends we 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.289
 we see in the next episode greetings
