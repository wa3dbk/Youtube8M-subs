00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.190
 star knows 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.589
 fri 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.610
 one may 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.500
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:49.220
 first unboxing video yes what a little 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.480
 bought big 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.820
 I was able to march an unboxing video 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.090
 last do not resist or no video 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.600
 but just a little slideshow sees 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:08.070
 this gtx 60 90 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 because the first one is relatively unspectacular 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
 actually the packaging of asus 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.830
 when I think other gigabyte or 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 so little was then have been possible 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.160
 yes that's what it looks like afterward 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:35.100
 which takes away the paper, so to speak , and then 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:37.380
 yes that gets the device so it now on 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.700
 every case is a big part of what is mine 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.290
 Like beautiful solid processed one 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 I'm still a little scared of the fans 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.620
 On the other side you should 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.480
 probably think about that team 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.570
 is not overclocked and therefore 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.380
 He will probably give you a fan 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 presumably we will see so 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.400
 if the thing was not two years ago 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 breaks down then I go in any case 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.740
 to the video because that's not about 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.280
 how to use normal video card where to look 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 quickly bought new but good 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.640
 Ventilation just like that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.650
 her notes with that thing and whistles 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.010
 through the slits through that is so 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.980
 a kind of glass from the next yes there 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.980
 yes, what heart does not beat higher 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.519
 Yes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:36.440
 the thing has been breaded at least in the 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:38.659
 in the version of asus 3 tv is that 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.099
 tv exactly three dvi one of which one 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.670
 little different is no idea what's there 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.859
 and unlike a compact 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 hdmi-connection yes from asus I have 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:57.260
 that's why synonymous because my gtx 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.420
 560 ti two co2 as well as this one of them 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.400
 asus and also has a very nice case 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.079
 So that 's when the warmer or 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.540
 expanded or for which reasons too 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.500
 always that nothing happens 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.709
 and she has served me well 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.109
 That's why I have you from us now 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.680
 excluding yes to something 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.680
 looked out 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.549
 this is an editor , but even for 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.060
 medi tower actually not small and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.949
 we see that there is not much room 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.169
 now the big dream fan is that 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:40.190
 All in all, now there were none 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:43.370
 problems the geforce gtx lights up when 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.240
 the calculator is so funny 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.660
 actually 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:53.370
 and yes, yes, here you can see how much 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.040
 so there is space I actually have 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.510
 approximately 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.650
 I know I can go five or ten minutes 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.750
 with several attempts in it 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.690
 ranks with the card until the really 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.850
 since it was in there and I would like quite 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.350
 say there is only half a millimeter 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.830
 but there is no space left 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.100
 in between that's that I have it here 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.650
 also on this this room here 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.720
 Slight right sees over there 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.980
 then you have to left it by the way 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.160
 Of course, still in the lead 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.620
 come in , that was a lot 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.170
 brief history and that the tower of the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.990
 is also relatively massive and relatively 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.500
 That's why blessing or something like that would be 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:44.060
 even if I come to ask 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:48.060
 yes and so the whole house looks up 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.680
 every case tried out now 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.540
 very good in any case the 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.710
 latest driver is the map itself 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.100
 not old that 's why they need 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.290
 operator drivers in the first the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.540
 Blender was then constantly 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.850
 crashed in race mode was 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.520
 probably a bit too fast 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.140
 The card runs as a double 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.140
 execution or in the sli 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:15.300
 coupled versions of magix 680 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.940
 that is, this is virtually internal 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.710
 two cards 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.560
 and he runs the blender because of that 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.450
 double quasi so the details 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.760
 adjust so that's just the picture 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.440
 divided by two so each one 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:35.160
 graphics card a separate thing 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:38.430
 can make and runs quite well 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.400
 Not loud, I mean, that needs it 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.000
 That's why it does not mean that 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.100
 it everyone must have and but in any 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.289
 a pretty story and that 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.909
 Do you want to show yourself and then 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.909
 Look, I have to do a few things now 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.649
 prepare for the company as well 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.669
 few things the men just show 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:06.289
 can possibilities and so on then 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.509
 a little something then show for you 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.699
 that shows your next videos and 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.169
 otherwise genii regular tutorials too 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.520
 but not like that 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.240
 continuous but I have to look 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.259
 as I have time 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.669
 and yes it was, meanwhile times and I 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.849
 wish you a nice sunday until 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.849
 then
