at<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.719> particular<00:00:13.530> porn<00:00:13.980> structure<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
at a particular porn structure which is

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.630 
at a particular porn structure which is
universal<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:18.230> Queens<00:00:19.230> pawn<00:00:19.470> openings<00:00:19.980> also

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
universal to Queens pawn openings also

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.170 
universal to Queens pawn openings also
can<00:00:21.210> occur<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.510> King's<00:00:21.930> pawn<00:00:22.140> openings<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
can occur from King's pawn openings and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
can occur from King's pawn openings and
a<00:00:24.320> structure<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.560> call<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> Kappa

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
a structure which I call the Kappa

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.419 
a structure which I call the Kappa
Blanco<00:00:26.730> structure<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:28.560> suppose<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.160> first

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Blanco structure and I suppose the first

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.780 
Blanco structure and I suppose the first
question<00:00:30.140> which<00:00:31.140> might<00:00:31.349> arise<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
question which might arise is what is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.660 
question which might arise is what is
the<00:00:33.000> cap<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> blanket<00:00:33.570> structure<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
the cap of blanket structure in that and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
the cap of blanket structure in that and
this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> name<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.719> recently

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this is a name which which I recently

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.850 
this is a name which which I recently
made<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> featured<00:00:41.670> position

made up for it and the featured position
shows<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.489> structure<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210

it arises from the Carrick on the
Rubenstein<00:01:52.140> French<00:01:52.700> but<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.420> specific

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
Rubenstein French but the the specific

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
Rubenstein French but the the specific
positions<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.070> considering<00:01:56.930> have

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
positions which will be considering have

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
positions which will be considering have
really<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> Queen's<00:01:58.860> pawn<00:01:59.159> flavor<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
really a Queen's pawn flavor to them in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.450 
really a Queen's pawn flavor to them in
my<00:02:00.180> view<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.829> because<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.070> pawn<00:02:02.310> on

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
my view because because of this pawn on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.569 
my view because because of this pawn on
c4<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.770> distinguishes<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.549> from

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
c4 so this is what distinguishes it from

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
c4 so this is what distinguishes it from
just<00:02:06.119> talking<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.290> general<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
CARICOM for instance we're talking in

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
CARICOM for instance we're talking in
general<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.289> root<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.470> son<00:02:10.770> french<00:02:11.039> is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
general about the root and son french is

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460 
general about the root and son french is
that<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.510> considering<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.050> positions

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that will be considering the positions

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.820 
that will be considering the positions
where<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
where the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
that and the the ideas section and we'll

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.200 
that and the the ideas section and we'll
talk<00:02:27.420> about<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.680> get<00:02:28.920> into<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
talk about that when we get into the the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.940 
talk about that when we get into the the
more<00:02:30.420> substantive<00:02:30.870> content<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.950> suppose

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
more substantive content but I suppose

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.260 
more substantive content but I suppose
the<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.510> reason<00:02:36.930> why<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.580> wanted<00:02:39.090> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the the reason why and I wanted to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.120 
the the reason why and I wanted to
address<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.960> structure<00:02:40.380> was<00:02:40.530> because<00:02:40.860> i

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
address this structure was because i

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.930 
address this structure was because i
think<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.570> unexplored<00:02:43.560> or<00:02:43.980> an

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
think it's an unexplored or an

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.490 
think it's an unexplored or an
underexplored<00:02:45.570> topic<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.350> chess<00:02:46.710> because

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
underexplored topic in chess because

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.020 
underexplored topic in chess because
looking<00:02:49.500> through<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.830> own<00:02:49.950> games<00:02:50.280> i<00:02:50.610> find

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
looking through my own games i find

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.270 
looking through my own games i find
multiple<00:02:51.810> examples<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.709> structure<00:02:53.010> with

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
multiple examples of this structure with

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.540 
multiple examples of this structure with
with<00:02:53.580> why<00:02:53.760> done<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.180> black<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:55.740> seems

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
with why done with black and it seems

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.390 
with why done with black and it seems
like<00:02:56.670> there<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.030> are<00:02:57.420> identifiable

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
like there there are identifiable

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
like there there are identifiable
principles<00:02:59.400> which<00:02:59.610> govern<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.970> structure

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
principles which govern the structure

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.530 
principles which govern the structure
principles<00:03:00.959> which<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.470> learn<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.510> i

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
principles which we can learn and but i

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.910 
principles which we can learn and but i
think<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.900> something<00:03:04.080> which<00:03:04.200> isn't<00:03:04.350> isn't

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
think it's something which isn't isn't

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.710 
think it's something which isn't isn't
traditionally<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:05.730> well<00:03:05.970> explored<00:03:06.420> it's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
traditionally very well explored it's

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.260 
traditionally very well explored it's
not<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.620> an<00:03:07.890> isolated<00:03:08.430> Queens<00:03:08.670> pawn<00:03:08.970> or<00:03:09.240> a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
not like an isolated Queens pawn or a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.380 
not like an isolated Queens pawn or a
hedgehog<00:03:09.780> or<00:03:09.930> something<00:03:10.350> at<00:03:10.910> which<00:03:11.910> wich<00:03:12.240> has

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
hedgehog or something at which wich has

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.530 
hedgehog or something at which wich has
a<00:03:12.450> whole<00:03:12.720> whole<00:03:13.140> body<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.560> theory<00:03:13.830> around<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
a whole whole body of theory around it

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.970 
a whole whole body of theory around it
so<00:03:15.540> often<00:03:15.720> players<00:03:16.080> just<00:03:16.350> need<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:16.830> of

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so often players just need to kind of

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.430 
so often players just need to kind of
muddle<00:03:17.280> muddle<00:03:17.640> their<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.269> through<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.320> what

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
muddle muddle their way through so what

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.820 
muddle muddle their way through so what
I<00:03:19.470> hope<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.769> do<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.459> presentation<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.239> to

I hope to do in this presentation is to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.440 
I hope to do in this presentation is to
to<00:03:22.830> give<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> some<00:03:23.370> ideas<00:03:23.760> with<00:03:24.030> why<00:03:24.239> done

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
to give you some ideas with why done

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.360 
to give you some ideas with why done
with<00:03:24.600> black<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.200> what<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> keys<00:03:25.920> the

with black as to what are the keys the

sides use in trying to handle this type

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.590 
sides use in trying to handle this type
of<00:03:34.200> structure<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:34.800> from<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.180> wide<00:03:36.180> range<00:03:36.390> of

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
of structure but from a wide range of

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.930 
of structure but from a wide range of
openings<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:38.190> should<00:03:38.489> mention<00:03:38.519> as<00:03:38.910> well

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
openings and I should mention as well

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.060 
openings and I should mention as well
the<00:03:39.180> reason<00:03:39.510> why<00:03:39.690> I've<00:03:39.840> called<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
the reason why I've called it the the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.130 
the reason why I've called it the the
Kappa<00:03:41.370> blanket<00:03:41.730> structure<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.120> because<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
Kappa blanket structure is because the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.410 
Kappa blanket structure is because the
fundamental<00:03:43.769> ideas<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.820> particular<00:03:44.910> for<00:03:45.330> her

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
fundamental ideas in particular for her

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.870 
fundamental ideas in particular for her
black<00:03:45.720> should<00:03:45.959> play<00:03:46.170> were<00:03:46.890> laid<00:03:47.340> down<00:03:47.550> by

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
black should play were laid down by

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.290 
black should play were laid down by
Kappa<00:03:48.150> Blanca<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.950> all<00:03:50.030> around<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.180> hundred

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
Kappa Blanca and all around a hundred

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.320 
Kappa Blanca and all around a hundred
years<00:03:51.660> ago<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:54.019> even<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.470> very<00:03:56.330> very

different openings against different
opponents<00:03:59.489> and<00:04:00.500> those<00:04:01.500> ideas<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.370> my<00:04:02.850> mind<00:04:03.090> are

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
opponents and those ideas to my mind are

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.530 
opponents and those ideas to my mind are
still<00:04:03.510> remarkably<00:04:04.080> fresh<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.090> still<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.239> form

still remarkably fresh and still in form

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.820 
still remarkably fresh and still in form
at<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.820> top<00:04:08.820> level<00:04:09.330> play<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.500> structure

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
at the top level play in this structure

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.460 
at the top level play in this structure
and<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.739> hope<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:16.140> can<00:04:16.290> learn

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and so I hope that you can you can learn

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.349 
and so I hope that you can you can learn
something<00:04:16.799> from<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.190> DVD<00:04:17.640> maybe<00:04:17.910> get<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> few

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
something from this DVD maybe get a few

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.270 
something from this DVD maybe get a few
ideas<00:04:18.660> for<00:04:19.109> your<00:04:19.200> own<00:04:19.260> games<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.830> may<00:04:20.220> be

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
ideas for your own games that may be

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.190 
ideas for your own games that may be
openings<00:04:20.760> which<00:04:20.880> you'd<00:04:21.000> like<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.330> try<00:04:21.540> because

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
openings which you'd like to try because
