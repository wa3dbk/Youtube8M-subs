00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 sour makes funny little there is the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 cucumbers 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.919
 I never thought that I was like that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.090
 would do the lawn itself then 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.400
 I have my ingredients 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 read through and there is always 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.610
 Separate sugar 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.160
 That's why I'm making pickles now 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.380
 itself and the advantage of it is not 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 only the potassium content cucumbers and what I 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 no sugar will go in now 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.779
 but also that I can do the same 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.619
 which spices come to it 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.619
 you can do that too 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.160
 hello and welcome office as well 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.899
 today there are cucumbers and me 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.960
 do not believe in the good restaurants 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.290
 but I was slicing so 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 got big cucumbers that 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 that probably not very special 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
 would look pretty 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 That's why it just makes in slices 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.860
 sliced â€‹â€‹ingredients are the questions 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.320
 the main actors in this recipe are 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.320
 year and I have small here 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.479
 Castles are great for loading 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.039
 then I have as spices 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.479
 Selected dill coriander and strange 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.000
 you you could instead be the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 example, holger vikings use whole 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 pepper or laurel leaves then comes 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 the addition I also use something else 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.289
 sweet i have happened here if you 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.070
 can nevertheless showed ticks to use 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:29.220
 or omit the psyche altogether 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 apple cider as well as water the cucumbers 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.440
 I am now small with his rover 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.149
 plan to write in peace if you have one 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.380
 high not you can of course synonymous 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.380
 a knife used 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 if you came then bleeding 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.359
 strong school hates then takes over 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.640
 drive in the last piece instead 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.640
 two more digits have been cut out 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.759
 chancellor overlap 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.709
 walkers after cut either 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.580
 write or tweet 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.580
 I like 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.440
 the salt with huge bazaar mission is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.780
 even whole game dissolved and then is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.230
 it is important that this mix the the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.810
 completely disconnected below that we do not you 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.349
 so is and just around 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.349
 water 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.570
 3 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.670
 Here is my work 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.799
 I have that after I felt 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.519
 had the fridge for her 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.709
 so that also little screwed 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:47.160
 then had as little air as possible 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:53.489
 hindsight comes and sour makes fun 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.709
 certain agrees babbel has 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.269
 my pigs are pretty cheap 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:04.290
 exactly become important then I find 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.760
 maybe some without the other 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.970
 herbs inside 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.650
 Let's see what we think of everything but 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.319
 otherwise mustard seeds and to taste in tate 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.910
 certainly very, very good 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.769
 I hope that our recipe pleased 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.599
 if that is so then it is not 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.669
 comment on the same partner and 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.989
 remains even if the ideas have that we 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.000
 what could be next 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.250
