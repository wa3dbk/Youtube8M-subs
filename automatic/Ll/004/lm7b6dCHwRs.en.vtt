I<00:01:00.989> know<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.070> looks<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I know this looks like a lot of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
I know this looks like a lot of
applications<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
applications to look at it once but to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
applications to look at it once but to
me<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.479> makes<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.840> life<00:01:06.960> easier<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.500> when

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
me just makes my life easier now when

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.530 
me just makes my life easier now when
like<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.549> still<00:01:08.880> give<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:09.869> seven<00:01:10.229> wide

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
like this it's still give me seven wide

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
like this it's still give me seven wide
now<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> seven<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
now if you don't want the seven why the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.160 
now if you don't want the seven why the
only<00:01:15.180> thing<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.840> disable

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
only thing you can do is disable

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.520 
only thing you can do is disable
launcher<00:01:16.650> rotation<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.470> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
launcher rotation which when you're in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.429 
launcher rotation which when you're in
the<00:01:19.590> launcher<00:01:20.180> what<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> wrote<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> so

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the launcher what you wrote in it so

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
the launcher what you wrote in it so
there's<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
there's actually no way to go back to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's actually no way to go back to
the<00:01:25.290> original<00:01:25.490> width<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.820> six<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.479> anything

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the original width like six or anything

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
the original width like six or anything
like<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.619> seven<00:01:29.070> looks<00:01:29.220> more<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
like that but seven looks more like that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.840 
like that but seven looks more like that
so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.299> personally<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.140> five<00:01:32.100> columns<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so I personally like five columns but

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
so I personally like five columns but
again<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.180> i<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:33.630> five<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.229> four

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
again if i want to go from five to four

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
again if i want to go from five to four
i'm<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> unselect<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.890> hit<00:01:37.890> home<00:01:38.479> open

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
i'm going to unselect this hit home open

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
i'm going to unselect this hit home open
up<00:01:39.540> Esther<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.200> use<00:01:40.290> any<00:01:40.439> task<00:01:40.770> killer

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
up Esther you can use any task killer

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
up Esther you can use any task killer
you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.460> even<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.790> from<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> terminal

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you can even do this from the terminal

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
you can even do this from the terminal
but<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.159> easier<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.820> from

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
but it's easier to do it this way from

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.740 
but it's easier to do it this way from
me<00:01:45.119> process<00:01:46.079> manager<00:01:46.530> scroll<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.750> launcher

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
me process manager scroll down launcher

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.669

kill

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.740 

and<00:01:55.679> there<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.310> back<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> consider

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and there we go back to what I consider

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.529 
and there we go back to what I consider
to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> boring<00:01:58.770> old<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.539> apparently
