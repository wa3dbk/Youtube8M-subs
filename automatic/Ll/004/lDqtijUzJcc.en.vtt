00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.100
 here is what we have heard 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.030
 in the project of who it is 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.259
 let us look already given the love of stucco 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.429
 and then we waited for it to dry after which I passed with 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.489
 this abrasive sponge in motion routes unevenness of dirt 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.839
 I've had the chance 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.730
 divide why keep yourself baxi 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.199
 with stucco just to avoid those of having to declare so much 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.999
 one in four prepared 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.730
 another putty with his 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.570
 reagent is surely dumb as stucco but I prefer meat a little bit of 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.220
 more 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 and be sure you can finish it off that 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.130
 links eggplant companies 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.220
 fuck in uk uk maybe go too short 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.650
 as usual 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.690
 little catalyst 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.680
 so you have more time for new bravo 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.820
 nicholas is always with photos of nals soft rubber 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.410

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.790

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.630
 give a damn 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 I prefer to spend a little more time fighting 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.790
 to remain too soloscacchi that god seems to me to remember given 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 offers a dose so accessibility 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.690
 in the super we have 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.330
 more or less from toutube 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 needed more 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 let's see 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.680
 go appears as a structure 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 link please then we arrived at bari 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.030
 using a small piece of plexiglass 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 and this pinto declare it as smooth as possible 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 trend I'm already using does the part 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.760
 using mortar 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.620
 and this to what I have hope 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 I love you doing the same thing below 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 Oh well 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.079
 you have been doing it for only 24 hours and then we should be a little bit 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.889
 oh God it would still be to give you a pass still qua maxim 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.149
 added 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.009
 I am only allowed if 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.969
 use little catalyst 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.359
 and at this point it would have already become hard 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.639
 untouchable 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.439
 hi no people when you have 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.589
 in quotation marks exaggerated with the head wholeheartedly 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.639
 when the putty when a given look at it without crisis 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.899
 spalding small pieces 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.690
 clear sign what age you have 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.629
 exaggerated a moment with pocket catalyst waited a little too much yourself 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.819
 we can't stand 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.169
 we are doing right 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 darren on arrival 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:02.419

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.869
 see already 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.269
 polo stocco started caries to make small pieces 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.019
 how this gap progresses we throw it away without problems and without too many 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.149
 hesitations 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.289
 so much we know that work came well 3 bassano full pass 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.099
 but this part that has more fineco the sandpaper and we are ready for collarme 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.079
 desio 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.979
 oh God maybe not even all this precision for the magazine was needed 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.079
 of work we want to do if you later broke with the stickers 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.780
 however I will make them precise even if then it is covered with convenience because not 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.109
 so much a difference between doing a job well done is crap is a minute 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.729
 in more so it is worth to use this link 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:46.529
 to the next
