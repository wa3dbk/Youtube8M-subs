00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.049
 here after having worked well their 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.789
 patch come 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.700
 you form balls of the size 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:20.009
 a bathtub but you can train 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.810
 of toddlers major plans 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.950
 so I will give them contact for 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:35.300
 hunt 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 and then I previously 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.340
 for many 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.390
 the judge so on until 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 exhaustion of the dough 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 I come to arrange them on a sheet of 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.490
 cooking that this one and have so 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:08.480
 in a in a grid actually going 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.480
 in the oven and I spaces 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.879
 I cook them so it's according to your 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.549
 for me I cook them 20 minutes to 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:26.760
 150 degrees it has to be really 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:28.930
 very slightly you must like this 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.049
 otherwise they will harden it really 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.819
 not helped then julien pour so my 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.819
 jam all hot in and soft 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.940
 I incorporate shortbreads 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.670
 2 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.050
 I like well warned two jam 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.350
 that's what will actually give them all 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:05.120
 their funds in I tasted them then 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.120
 I incorporate them in the coupon note 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.870
 so that's thanks 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:25.829
 1 but do I impregnate the biscuit of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.819
 our only to play 10 inches in a 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.159
 small plate 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.370
 so here we know so on for 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.560
 all the cookies so me frankly 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.329
 I prefer them the next day because they 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.239
 are really really really fondant 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.560
 and will be well impregnated with jam 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.739
 or frankly that's what I tell you 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.739
 advises 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.100
 so that's the end result are 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.520
 really not super succulent these little ones 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 biscuits 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.730
 I only have to wish you a good 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.910
 appetite and I tell you see you soon on my 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.910
