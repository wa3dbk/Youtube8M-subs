00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
Kenny first I guess take us through the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.529 
Kenny first I guess take us through the

history you know when we started talking

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.510 
history you know when we started talking
about<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.900> game<00:00:29.110> creating<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.860> game<00:00:30.039> how<00:00:30.460> you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
about the game creating the game how you

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.130 
about the game creating the game how you
decided<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.800> heal<00:00:32.800> well<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:34.059> mean<00:00:34.330> there<00:00:34.989> were<00:00:35.080> a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
decided to heal well I mean there were a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.689 
decided to heal well I mean there were a
couple<00:00:35.199> important<00:00:35.800> factors<00:00:36.100> like<00:00:36.250> one<00:00:36.489> we

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
couple important factors like one we

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.030 
couple important factors like one we
wanted<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:38.170> wanted<00:00:38.379> to<00:00:38.500> move<00:00:38.769> in<00:00:38.890> the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
wanted to we wanted to move in the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.920 
wanted to we wanted to move in the
direction<00:00:39.160> of<00:00:39.550> not<00:00:39.730> having<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.059> do<00:00:40.600> lots<00:00:40.750> of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
direction of not having to do lots of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.720 
direction of not having to do lots of
like<00:00:41.140> low-level<00:00:41.530> like<00:00:41.920> health<00:00:42.129> management<00:00:42.489> in

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
like low-level like health management in

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.009 
like low-level like health management in
the<00:00:42.820> game<00:00:42.970> one<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.330> player<00:00:43.480> to<00:00:43.570> feel<00:00:43.780> like

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
the game one of the player to feel like

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.680 
the game one of the player to feel like
okay<00:00:44.530> like<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:44.979> can<00:00:45.190> I<00:00:45.430> can<00:00:45.790> be<00:00:45.970> shot<00:00:46.239> at<00:00:46.449> and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
okay like I can I can be shot at and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.450 
okay like I can I can be shot at and
there's<00:00:46.839> gun<00:00:47.080> battles<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.650> that<00:00:47.739> happens<00:00:48.250> and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
there's gun battles and that happens and

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.860 
there's gun battles and that happens and
everything's<00:00:49.120> fine<00:00:49.360> as<00:00:49.540> long<00:00:49.570> as<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.809> don't

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
everything's fine as long as I don't

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.039 
everything's fine as long as I don't
take<00:00:50.110> too<00:00:50.290> much<00:00:50.409> damage<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.030> too<00:00:52.750> short<00:00:52.930> a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
take too much damage like in too short a

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.170 
take too much damage like in too short a
time<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.559> if<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.769> happens<00:00:54.070> then<00:00:54.909> we're<00:00:55.089> like

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
time and if that happens then we're like

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.549 
time and if that happens then we're like
well<00:00:55.390> instead<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.659> just<00:00:55.839> being<00:00:56.019> dead<00:00:56.290> you

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
well instead of just being dead you

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.930 
well instead of just being dead you
should<00:00:56.739> get<00:00:56.920> wounded<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:57.699> should<00:00:57.820> have

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
should get wounded and you should have

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.910 
should get wounded and you should have
to<00:00:58.059> deal<00:00:58.269> with<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.690> repercussions<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.620> being

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
to deal with the repercussions of being

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.799 
to deal with the repercussions of being
wounded<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.850> having<00:01:01.239> this<00:01:01.360> life-threatening

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
wounded and having this life-threatening

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.289 
wounded and having this life-threatening
injury<00:01:02.559> while<00:01:03.369> you're<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.940> sort<00:01:04.210> of

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
injury while you're in the sort of

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.080 
injury while you're in the sort of
intensity<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.989> battle<00:01:05.619> so<00:01:06.430> we<00:01:06.549> created<00:01:06.909> this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
intensity of battle so we created this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.730 
intensity of battle so we created this
wound<00:01:07.330> system<00:01:07.720> where<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.440> know<00:01:08.530> when<00:01:08.680> you

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
wound system where you know when you

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.380 
wound system where you know when you
take<00:01:08.920> too<00:01:09.040> much<00:01:09.130> damage<00:01:09.190> too<00:01:09.640> quickly<00:01:09.880> we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
take too much damage too quickly we

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.330 
take too much damage too quickly we
detect<00:01:10.750> what<00:01:10.990> caused<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.440> damage<00:01:11.590> like<00:01:12.159> say

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
detect what caused the damage like say

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.580 
detect what caused the damage like say
it<00:01:12.430> was<00:01:12.549> a<00:01:12.580> gunshot<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.299> fire<00:01:13.570> or<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:14.530> an

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
it was a gunshot or a fire or or an

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.380 
it was a gunshot or a fire or or an
explosion<00:01:15.190> or<00:01:15.310> whatever<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.760> then<00:01:16.090> we<00:01:16.210> have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
explosion or whatever and then we have

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.200 
explosion or whatever and then we have
this<00:01:16.570> library<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.409> about<00:01:17.680> probably<00:01:18.490> about<00:01:18.789> 60

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
this library of about probably about 60

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.609 
this library of about probably about 60
animations<00:01:19.750> will<00:01:19.960> have<00:01:20.079> in<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.229> final<00:01:20.530> game

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
animations will have in the final game

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.459 
animations will have in the final game
you<00:01:20.770> only<00:01:20.859> have<00:01:21.009> about<00:01:21.100> 12<00:01:21.520> now<00:01:22.109> just<00:01:23.109> to<00:01:23.229> prove

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
you only have about 12 now just to prove

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.920 
you only have about 12 now just to prove
that<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.740> system<00:01:24.039> works<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.840> will

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
that the system works and what will

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.389 
that the system works and what will
happen<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.289> you'll<00:01:26.439> get<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.649> wound<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.039> you'll

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
happen is you'll get a wound and you'll

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.480 
happen is you'll get a wound and you'll
need<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.670> get<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:27.939> cover<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.420> heal<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.990> wound

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
need to get to cover and heal that wound

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.980 
need to get to cover and heal that wound
by<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.549> know<00:01:30.880> pulling<00:01:31.119> pulling<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.659> bullet<00:01:31.899> out

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
by you know pulling pulling a bullet out

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.109 
by you know pulling pulling a bullet out
of<00:01:32.049> your<00:01:32.259> leg<00:01:32.560> or<00:01:32.979> or<00:01:33.579> putting<00:01:33.850> out<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> fire

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
of your leg or or putting out a fire

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
somewhere on your body or or you know

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.859 
somewhere on your body or or you know
pulling<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.759> piece<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:36.939> shrapnel<00:01:37.240> or<00:01:37.570> something

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
pulling a piece of shrapnel or something

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.959 
pulling a piece of shrapnel or something
out<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:37.990> out<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.380> out<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.219> your<00:01:39.429> torso<00:01:39.670> or

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
out of out of out of your torso or

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.080 
out of out of out of your torso or
whatever<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.270> happens<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.570> be<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
whatever it happens to be so and the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.319 
whatever it happens to be so and the
idea<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.539> really<00:01:44.759> there's<00:01:45.759> two<00:01:45.909> important

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
idea is to really there's two important

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.050 
idea is to really there's two important
things<00:01:46.509> one<00:01:47.049> is<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.409> create<00:01:48.249> a<00:01:48.429> really<00:01:48.820> strong

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
things one is to create a really strong
