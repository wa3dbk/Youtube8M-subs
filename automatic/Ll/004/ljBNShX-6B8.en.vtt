00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 before I start this video I'll do 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 a plea for you please have people 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.690
 forget that it leaves your like that your 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.590
 jewelry at the beginning of the video please 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.910
 Why do you end up forgetting me? 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:30.590
 helps a lot 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:30.590
 Ok let's start with an old one. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 personal speech of the android world channel 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 Let's review this new one. 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.879
 update that came out is actually is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 same version 4.4.2 much improved 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.920
 There are some simple 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 defects that in fact have been 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 corrected for example the live volume 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.920
 the connection volume that was low 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.719
 has been fixed is the connection interface 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 It did not look wonderful but it improved. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.750
 seemed to ping the old version and I 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.140
 I'll pass on some tricks, for example. 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.240
 as you pass your cell phone 1.2 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 for 1.3 tap and some things of the genre 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.970
 Frequently Asked Questions 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.790
 I ended up developing these questions. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.640
 frequent because people 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 they asked a lot do not need to do 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 last is this 11 cm she already comes with 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.720
 mutti need not do anything else 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.869
 also gps has not disappeared from your cell phone 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.320
 you're going to install and activate max here 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.290
 its just fine, this is not good 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.659
 disappeared your gps on is not working 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.079
 if you are migrating given 4.4.2 to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.969
 This is where the 4.4.2 plus 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.060
 does not cause confusion for the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.579
 extent are you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.730
 You're not going to do that process. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.970
 dindin bial I've covered what's in the other 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.100
 you will simply download the package 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.340
 new is available here in the description 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 video is going to send to your 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.600
 smartphone and will give a factory reset right 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 normal 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.200
 there in the recovery menu and install the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.720
 new package is just the same process as 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.210
 It's in the video, I'll do it again. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 What have you lost doing again? 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.650
 You will do everything that is in the other. 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.870
 if you already have the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 version 4.4.2 you're just going to enter 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.230
 recovery mode is normally 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.640
 As a video, it's okay, so this is it. 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.800
 so come on here and I'm going to talk about what 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.660
 rolls, okay 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.250
 We are going to use this program, I 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.050
 I'll put a link of all the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.350
 here in the video description 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.880
 Are you going to have it? I'll go with everything I showed here. 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.550
 work the cpu z is this application if you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.730
 see it already here as 1.3 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.180
 but its yours both cuts here 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.850
 underneath if you notice how united 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.870
 1200 between the original Galaxy 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.330
 grandiose 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.850
 So how do I close this? 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.620
 as I do to supercharge the place 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.260
 galaxy grandiose 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.370
 you will download the ct the master of amtu 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.890
 We're going to open it he will ask for a 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.050
 super user remembering that yours already has 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.239
 a super user then you put the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.160
 last option reminded me of this choice 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:49.380
 forever and lets you look here 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.580
 Are you here in a breakthrough? 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 processor 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.220
 so are you will not fiddle on such a scale 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.160
 it will only leave one of man that here he goes 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.709
 use the maximum clock only when 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.530
 If you need to play here, look at me. 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.530
 and 300 megahertz and apply 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 See ya, it's already swinging from 312 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:21.660
 for 1,300 your big galaxy is already 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.360
 running at 1,300 megawatts there are not 1,200 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:33.180
 How original it is is something else too. 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:35.040
 is that people have doubt is to transfer 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.050
 the games to the memory card then 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.580
 I'm going to open the memory card here. Let's go. 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.950
 view storage 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.080
 We got 2 gigs points 63 to ok 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:50.190
 so we're going to use the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.620
 lsd app and I have the game here 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.770
 I simply installed it to show 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.530
 how to transfer the card 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.540
 from memory then I will open gls from and it 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.600
 You already gave me the list of what I 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.450
 I can move and I 'll select here and 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.169
 move has people talking that does not move that 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:15.320
 does not work, can not move 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:23.789
 so I 'll show it working there 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:27.120
 was 2.65 with some beauty moved to the 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.660
 card there will open the storage 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.660
 new 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:48.900
 there if you repair it is now available 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.860

 Okay, you can open up your use and sound.

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.460

 overclocking is running the tac 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.430
 processor working one thousand and 300 mhz 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.669
 You see, and that's it. I'll show you the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.830
 interface to connect how did it get 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:27.300
 got a thousand better wonders 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:28.050
 rather the team it asks yes or yes 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.780
 two 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.780
 greatly improved the other was very 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.880
 ugly and makes sell the fish here if
