00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the first time I'm saw that so that was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.569 
the first time I'm saw that so that was
a<00:02:33.930> little<00:02:34.109> bit<00:02:34.290> different<00:02:34.650> from<00:02:34.769> me<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.159> the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
a little bit different from me on the

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.089 
a little bit different from me on the
thing<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:35.969> this<00:02:36.120> one<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:37.049> does<00:02:37.379> not<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.859> any

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
very soft i will say that they're very

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.390

very<00:04:03.389> soft<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.290> course<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.709> brush<00:04:04.919> is<00:04:05.129> going
