they're<00:01:40.710> traipsin<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:41.549> along<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:42.030> I've

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
they're traipsin right along where I've

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
they're traipsin right along where I've
just<00:01:42.420> dusted<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.869> sprayed<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.009> I've<00:01:44.159> gone

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
just dusted and sprayed so now I've gone

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
just dusted and sprayed so now I've gone
with<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> triple<00:01:45.149> approach<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
with a triple approach now if it's a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
with a triple approach now if it's a
really<00:01:46.890> bad<00:01:47.070> case<00:01:47.369> than<00:01:47.640> something<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
really bad case than something like a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
really bad case than something like a
white<00:01:48.899> footed<00:01:49.259> ant<00:01:49.470> which<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> an<00:01:50.070> exotic

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
white footed ant which is an exotic

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
white footed ant which is an exotic
import<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:51.930> live<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> tree<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
import they actually live in a tree and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530 
import they actually live in a tree and
then<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> house<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:54.240> might<00:01:54.420> need

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
then get into the house you might need

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.730 
then get into the house you might need
to<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.750> outside<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.380> put<00:01:55.530> down<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to go outside and put down a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.249 
to go outside and put down a
time-release<00:01:56.369> around<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.020> granules<00:01:58.020> around

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
time-release around the granules around

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.660 
time-release around the granules around
the<00:01:58.350> house<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.920> spray<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.250> underneath<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the house and spray up underneath the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
the house and spray up underneath the
eaves<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.420> only<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> severe<00:02:01.170> case

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
eaves but that's only in a severe case

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.810 
eaves but that's only in a severe case
and<00:02:01.680> you'll<00:02:01.770> probably<00:02:01.890> need<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> professional

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and you'll probably need a professional

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
and you'll probably need a professional
so<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> hope<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.960> has<00:02:04.049> been<00:02:04.110> helpful
