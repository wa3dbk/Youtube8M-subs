00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
basic idea is um i think a lot of people

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
basic idea is um i think a lot of people
think<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.470> family<00:00:28.830> portraits<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> such<00:00:29.640> and

think of family portraits and such and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.160 
think of family portraits and such and
they<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> oh<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
they think of oh you know what got to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.840

stand<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:36.739> hand<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.920> yeah<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
stand like this hand up yeah but the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.880 
stand like this hand up yeah but the
basic<00:00:39.180> concept<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.379> instead<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
basic concept is is that instead of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 
basic concept is is that instead of
formal<00:00:41.579> posing<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> get<00:00:42.450> people<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.989> is
