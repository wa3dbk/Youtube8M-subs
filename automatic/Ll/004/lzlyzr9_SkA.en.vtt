and<00:02:06.770> it'll<00:02:06.890> go<00:02:06.979> way<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.700> air<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.880> be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and it'll go way up in the air and be

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.210 
and it'll go way up in the air and be
what<00:02:08.570> our<00:02:08.899> users<00:02:09.259> call<00:02:09.440> moon<00:02:09.739> ball<00:02:10.009> and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
what our users call moon ball and

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.340 
what our users call moon ball and
essentially<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.180> would<00:02:11.299> get<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.079> running

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
essentially I would get the the running

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.720 
essentially I would get the the running
back<00:02:12.470> catching<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.920> near<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.130> sideline<00:02:13.459> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
back catching it near the sideline and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.470 
back catching it near the sideline and
he<00:02:14.269> wouldn't<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.600> time<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> turn<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.290> up

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
he wouldn't have time to turn it up

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
he wouldn't have time to turn it up
field<00:02:15.659> so<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.050> year<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.530> tap<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
field so this year you just tap it and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.500 
field so this year you just tap it and
lob<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> him<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> he'll<00:02:18.060> catch<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.420> in

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
lob it to him and he'll catch it in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.119 
lob it to him and he'll catch it in
stride<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:19.080> plenty<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.379> times<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.860> get

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
stride and have plenty of times to get

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.039 
stride and have plenty of times to get
upfield<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.549> make<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> play<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.269> everybody

it's been a it's a bit of problem area

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.059 
it's been a it's a bit of problem area
in<00:02:45.299> our<00:02:45.390> game<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:45.840> been<00:02:45.900> tough<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.409> call<00:02:46.620> it

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
in our game it's been tough to call it

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.830 
in our game it's been tough to call it
oftentimes<00:02:47.459> led<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.970> sax<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.569> user

oftentimes led to sax and user

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.809 
oftentimes led to sax and user
frustration<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.069> kind<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.549> tuned

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
frustration so we kind of tuned

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.030 
frustration so we kind of tuned
play-action<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.480> variety<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> ways<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.860> first

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
play-action a variety of ways the first

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.289 
play-action a variety of ways the first
things<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.549> kind<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.879> sped<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
things we kind of sped up the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.729 
things we kind of sped up the
quarterback<00:02:54.750> animations<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.440> quarterback

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
quarterback animations the quarterback

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.830 
quarterback animations the quarterback
handoff<00:02:56.099> animations<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.540> let<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
handoff animations so if you let the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.240 
handoff animations so if you let the
play-action<00:02:58.230> develop<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.069> know<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
play-action develop you know the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.140 
play-action develop you know the
quarterback<00:02:59.549> would<00:02:59.640> get<00:02:59.760> away<00:02:59.910> from<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
quarterback would get away from the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.490 
quarterback would get away from the
center<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.420> little<00:03:00.660> quicker<00:03:00.810> he'll<00:03:01.019> get<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.349> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
center a little quicker he'll get in and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.050 
center a little quicker he'll get in and
out<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.620> his<00:03:01.799> fake<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> little<00:03:02.370> bit<00:03:02.489> faster<00:03:02.700> so

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
out of his fake a little bit faster so

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360 
out of his fake a little bit faster so
you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.299> pass<00:03:03.510> quicker<00:03:03.810> another<00:03:04.709> change<00:03:05.220> is

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
you can pass quicker another change is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.970 
you can pass quicker another change is
just<00:03:05.549> two<00:03:05.640> plays<00:03:05.849> themselves<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:07.200> had<00:03:07.410> brad

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
of changed the routes to have more block

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.530 
of changed the routes to have more block
and<00:03:17.280> release<00:03:17.549> routes<00:03:17.849> so<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> running<00:03:18.390> back

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
and release routes so the running back

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.420 
and release routes so the running back
after<00:03:19.170> his<00:03:19.290> fake<00:03:19.530> he'll<00:03:19.739> check<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.280> make<00:03:20.400> sure

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
after his fake he'll check and make sure

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.250 
after his fake he'll check and make sure
there's<00:03:21.120> nobody<00:03:21.389> coming<00:03:21.419> before<00:03:21.810> he<00:03:22.109> releases

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
there's nobody coming before he releases

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.349 
there's nobody coming before he releases
same<00:03:23.130> thing<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.400> lot<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.609> tight<00:03:23.790> ends<00:03:23.970> well

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.320 
actually sees it happen so a man about
13<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:52.100> won't<00:04:52.340> happen<00:04:52.550> until<00:04:52.820> they<00:04:53.030> see<00:04:53.090> the

13 that won't happen until they see the
ball<00:04:53.479> thrown<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.410> big<00:04:54.590> changes<00:04:54.830> this

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
ball thrown one of the big changes this

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.560 
ball thrown one of the big changes this
year<00:04:55.160> is<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.520> ability<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.970> disguise<00:04:56.360> your

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
year is the ability to disguise your

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.870 
year is the ability to disguise your
coverage<00:04:56.990> last<00:04:57.830> year's<00:04:58.130> game<00:04:58.340> was<00:04:58.639> a<00:04:58.669> real

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
coverage last year's game was a real

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.700 
coverage last year's game was a real
easy<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.330> tell<00:04:59.540> if<00:04:59.570> it<00:04:59.870> was<00:04:59.930> man<00:05:00.169> or<00:05:00.350> zone<00:05:00.380> you

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
easy to tell if it was man or zone you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.650 
easy to tell if it was man or zone you
could<00:05:00.830> simply<00:05:01.040> motion<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.910> receiver<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.540> if<00:05:02.570> a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
could simply motion a receiver and if a

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.480 
could simply motion a receiver and if a
defender<00:05:03.050> chased<00:05:03.290> him<00:05:03.440> across<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.680> field<00:05:04.040> you

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
defender chased him across the field you

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.159 
defender chased him across the field you
knew<00:05:04.639> his<00:05:04.820> man<00:05:04.940> coverage<00:05:05.300> right<00:05:05.450> away<00:05:05.690> this

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
knew his man coverage right away this

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.469 
knew his man coverage right away this
year<00:05:06.380> we<00:05:06.500> got<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.680> new<00:05:06.889> zone<00:05:07.190> swapping<00:05:07.729> logic<00:05:08.120> so

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
year we got a new zone swapping logic so

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.150 
year we got a new zone swapping logic so
defenders<00:05:08.900> will<00:05:09.080> chase<00:05:09.350> across<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
defenders will chase across the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.620 
defenders will chase across the
formation<00:05:10.669> as<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.880> receiver<00:05:11.150> goes<00:05:11.330> in<00:05:11.510> motion

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
formation as the receiver goes in motion

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.240 
formation as the receiver goes in motion
but<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.350> could<00:05:12.500> still<00:05:12.530> be<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:12.950> zone<00:05:13.040> coverage

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
but it could still be in zone coverage

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.980 
but it could still be in zone coverage
so<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.820> won't<00:05:14.060> know<00:05:14.240> until<00:05:14.450> you<00:05:14.600> actually<00:05:14.750> use

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
so you won't know until you actually use

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.360 
so you won't know until you actually use
snap<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.350> ball<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.680> then<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:15.890> still<00:05:16.070> have<00:05:16.100> to

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
snap the ball and then you still have to

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.800 
snap the ball and then you still have to
make<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.550> read<00:05:16.789> at<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.060> point<00:05:17.300> now<00:05:17.570> tell<00:05:17.780> me

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
make a read at that point now tell me

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.360 
make a read at that point now tell me

the slot we had often times in man
coverage<00:05:26.390> this<00:05:26.810> would<00:05:26.960> be<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.110> linebacker

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
coverage this would be a linebacker

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.469 
coverage this would be a linebacker
cover<00:05:28.160> diamond<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.640> you<00:05:28.910> know<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.270> was<00:05:29.390> an

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
immediate advantage for the offense and

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.920 
immediate advantage for the offense and
we<00:05:31.160> wanted<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.430> make<00:05:31.550> sure<00:05:31.610> we<00:05:32.030> use<00:05:32.450> best<00:05:32.750> on

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
we wanted to make sure we use best on
