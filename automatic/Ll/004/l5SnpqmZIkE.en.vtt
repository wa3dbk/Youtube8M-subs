00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.250
 kid choice i'll give you that 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:17.660
 the car that started it all at VAZ 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:20.079
 2107 spinning means salt to the mass 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.060
 red lips in front do not brake 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.440
 reduced gear pretty what are you 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.530
 inferior and you smoke other fucking krishna 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.530
 not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:41.820
 interferes guys clean 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:45.480
 So let's start, but itâ€™s not just that you can see 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.000
 he is up to hundreds buying carburetor on top 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.930
 they call anyone up unlike jack 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 As a rule, Sheker is much more expensive 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.090
 let's return to overclocking the declared overclocking to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.400
 hundreds of 16 seconds during this time can 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.550
 go to drink coffee but on summer tires 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.960
 crushed 2 we took a hundred for the whole 20 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 eight tenths of a second 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 so I want to give advice with such 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.090
 the result of the race is better to be 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090
 viewer 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 declaring the disassembly pump 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.360
 now i want you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.380
 and then lucy 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.420
 which one and 82 first is the price 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.300
 there are times 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.730
 you even 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.360
 how much chudit it is simply not cheaper 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.960
 the car 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 so that even this 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 on patsanskih 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.760
 that when I arrived in the vegas mouth 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.400
 Yurin is whole there 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.300
 guys dressed in design 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.300
 and they were giving 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.620
 and finally, I would like to give marks 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.160
 for three cars passed offset gets 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.310
 for rear-wheel drive 5 points for the price of 5 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 points for maintainability 5 points for 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.910
 appearance 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.430
 one point for the engine 1 point for 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.040
 safety along points for comfort 0 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 points and that 17 points and this is our first 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.200
 so tables of patsanskih machines can 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.480
