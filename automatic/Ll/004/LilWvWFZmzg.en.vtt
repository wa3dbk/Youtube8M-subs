00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello swami again atlantis 3570 and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:17.880
 Today we have another issue of the magazine 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:20.640
 robot spy look in this release 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.429
 installation of board and personal systems 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:35.160
 robots terminators tears of nature. 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:44.600
 with installation and start with personal 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:51.960
 robots all though it is impossible prince them it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:57.449
 proved similar to a sim well, also very 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:03.979
 advanced terminator robot all this 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:07.220
 known after nature 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.619
 night as I understand to show 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.330
 miniature robots 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 insects imitate not so much by 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.869
 most of there mostly try 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.470
 to make 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.240
 intelligence wars to every robot 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 filled the debt and turned out like for example 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.900
 addition to what was tortured there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.140
 similar insects that live 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.750
 No big olesya to become us 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 dinner you got paid and all seven 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.009
 you are more often replaced before them at frequency 24 this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.020
 also 3 ribbon cables per optional 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
 gasket two mounting screws 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.390
 you are afraid of the 5th edition of the Ministry of Justice to us you 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.990
 get you go on working on 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.610
 frequency 2 4 GHz which is necessary 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 attach to the board a data chiffon and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 systems using fasteners 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.729
 staples appeared here that we have in this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:19.830
 release league tv 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:24.319
 let's see always hide with us 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.900
 there are 3 such tape for 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.430
 all but not all of them are the first two the same 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:42.299
 This length is slightly longer. Disassemble them. 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:46.430
 put on it will be here we have four 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.430
 contact here 5 out of 5 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:03:00.799
 our fees are in this 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:00.799
 I look at the little bag cut off 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 here's the gasket 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:17.930
 insulating which we were promised 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.930
 need us drawn strengthen 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:32.370
 showed here is our fee they are with us 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.670
 there is a microchip control topic times like 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.280
 always capacitors transistors 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.590
 resistors diodes 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:50.849
 is quartz water ice their frequency 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:54.799
 16,000 well, so here's a connector for these 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:59.699
 wires 25 134 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:04.099
 forget it then we put it here 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:08.730
 mods like transmitters 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:12.060
 here is the antenna now guys i won't it 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.250
 strike for two reasons firstly me 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.289
 I do not want to disassemble the robot 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.500
 so that he lay unassembled 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.810
 expect to shoot it down constantly it 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.590
 quite problematic ie not that 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.740
 to muddy empty rather dreary 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.780
 occupation to keep it unassembled 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.289
 I somehow do not really want to know 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.190
 shaman someday and he lay on 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:43.130
 assembled scout shelf 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.750
 in how I have nowhere to go 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.669
 at least a round of children is so difficult 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:56.430
 to disassemble it is necessary to remove this one here 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:58.470
 part of the top is good 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.330
 shoot and then of course unscrew 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.870
 this detail 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.090
 and on either gets here slip it 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.120
 shoot and done there too ways no 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.960
 show our socks mother cattle 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.669
 it is necessary to slip as the gasket can 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.530
 mounted on the angle sensor 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.860
 this board itself will stand here 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.860
 at the side 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.419
 then the charter will have to collect and there 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.270
 again disassemble the antenna world then again 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.580
 For the sensor, this is me already thicker than white 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.879
 right away 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.979
 Well, here are guys, measles s, will I collect it 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.949
 I will probably be myself the next issue 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.699
 just there already with mrs antenna i 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.129
 will install 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:51.300
 and this receiver will be possible and 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:54.770
 put without understanding now i said i 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.889
 will not collect through in 2 reasons 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.889
 since I have no ability to run away 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.689
 time how do i allocate on wednesday i'm even 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.539

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.569
 I do not know whether to take it off today or 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.080
 tomorrow but lay out 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:23.550

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.400
 either weekend I'll forget time either 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:44.719
