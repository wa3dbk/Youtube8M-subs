00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.700 

I'm<00:00:10.390> talking<00:00:10.990> about<00:00:11.050> the<00:00:11.260> muscles<00:00:11.590> of<00:00:11.680> the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
I'm talking about the muscles of the

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.440 
I'm talking about the muscles of the
body<00:00:11.860> where<00:00:12.340> they<00:00:12.550> originate<00:00:13.030> where<00:00:13.300> they

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
body where they originate where they

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.600 
body where they originate where they
insert<00:00:13.870> and<00:00:14.110> the<00:00:14.500> various<00:00:14.800> actions<00:00:15.340> that<00:00:15.490> they

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
insert and the various actions that they

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.300 
insert and the various actions that they
perform<00:00:16.410> before<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.439> get<00:00:17.590> started<00:00:17.800> I<00:00:18.039> want<00:00:18.220> to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
perform before I get started I want to

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.950 
perform before I get started I want to
go<00:00:18.429> over<00:00:18.579> some<00:00:18.730> general<00:00:18.849> basics<00:00:19.480> they

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
go over some general basics they

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.749 
go over some general basics they
remember<00:00:20.380> that<00:00:20.529> origin<00:00:21.039> of<00:00:21.159> a<00:00:21.220> muscle<00:00:21.550> is

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
remember that origin of a muscle is

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.149 
remember that origin of a muscle is
going<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.179> be<00:00:22.329> the<00:00:22.480> attachment<00:00:23.079> sight<00:00:23.319> to<00:00:24.039> the

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:24.159 
going to be the attachment sight to the

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.220 
going to be the attachment sight to the
bone<00:00:24.339> that<00:00:24.669> does<00:00:24.880> not<00:00:25.179> move<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.779> the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
bone that does not move and the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.319 
bone that does not move and the
insertion<00:00:26.679> is<00:00:27.130> going<00:00:27.489> to<00:00:27.579> be<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:27.759> attachment

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
insertion is going to be the attachment

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.899 
insertion is going to be the attachment
sight<00:00:28.569> of<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.929> bone<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.109> does<00:00:29.560> move<00:00:29.919> now

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
sight of the bone that does move now

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.429 
sight of the bone that does move now
some<00:00:31.089> of<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.300> actions<00:00:31.749> of<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.079> various

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
some of the actions of the various

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.890 
some of the actions of the various
muscles<00:00:32.920> I'll<00:00:33.760> be<00:00:33.880> talking<00:00:34.090> about<00:00:34.300> flexion

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
muscles I'll be talking about flexion

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.380 
muscles I'll be talking about flexion
and<00:00:35.020> extension<00:00:35.490> remember<00:00:36.490> that<00:00:36.640> flexion<00:00:37.210> is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
and extension remember that flexion is

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.810 
and extension remember that flexion is
the<00:00:37.840> movement<00:00:38.290> that<00:00:38.500> decreases<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.310> angle

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
the movement that decreases the angle

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.510 
the movement that decreases the angle
between<00:00:40.000> two<00:00:40.330> parts<00:00:40.810> an<00:00:41.050> extension<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.190> the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
between two parts an extension is the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.930 
between two parts an extension is the
reverse<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:44.050> I'll<00:00:44.740> also<00:00:44.950> talk<00:00:45.280> about<00:00:45.310> pronate

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
reverse now I'll also talk about pronate

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.360 
reverse now I'll also talk about pronate
and<00:00:45.970> supinate<00:00:46.180> an<00:00:47.050> easy<00:00:47.740> way<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.010> remember

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
and supinate an easy way to remember

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.760 
and supinate an easy way to remember
supinate<00:00:49.060> is<00:00:49.240> cup<00:00:49.960> your<00:00:50.170> hand<00:00:50.410> like<00:00:50.590> you're

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
supinate is cup your hand like you're

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.069 
supinate is cup your hand like you're
holding<00:00:50.950> a<00:00:51.190> bowl<00:00:51.370> of<00:00:51.520> soup<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.970> if<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.600> dump

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
holding a bowl of soup and if you dump

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.620 
holding a bowl of soup and if you dump
the<00:00:53.260> soup<00:00:53.470> that's<00:00:53.829> pronation<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.760> B<00:00:55.420> duck

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
the soup that's pronation a B duck

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.690 
the soup that's pronation a B duck
shouldn't<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:56.079> deduction<00:00:56.860> remember<00:00:57.520> that<00:00:57.670> a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
shouldn't a deduction remember that a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.819 
shouldn't a deduction remember that a
deduction<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.660> adding<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.350> body<00:00:59.530> a

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
deduction is adding to the body a

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.090 
deduction is adding to the body a
deduction<00:01:00.820> is<00:01:00.910> taking<00:01:01.270> away<00:01:01.920> medial<00:01:02.920> rotation

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
deduction is taking away medial rotation

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.789 
deduction is taking away medial rotation
is<00:01:03.700> movement<00:01:04.570> towards<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> midline<00:01:05.320> so

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
is movement towards the midline so

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.260 
is movement towards the midline so
medially<00:01:06.280> rotate<00:01:06.670> would<00:01:06.789> be<00:01:06.880> turning<00:01:07.210> your

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
medially rotate would be turning your

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.300 
medially rotate would be turning your
foot<00:01:07.509> in<00:01:07.689> laterally<00:01:08.590> rotate<00:01:09.009> would<00:01:09.219> be

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
foot in laterally rotate would be

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.770 
foot in laterally rotate would be
turning<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.729> outward<00:01:10.090> or<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.359> the<00:01:10.450> lateral

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
turning it outward or to the lateral

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.739 
turning it outward or to the lateral
side<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.469> last<00:01:12.399> but<00:01:12.549> not<00:01:12.700> least<00:01:12.969> I<00:01:13.240> talked

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
side and last but not least I talked

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.270 
side and last but not least I talked
about<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.079> mandible<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.679> actions<00:01:15.069> of<00:01:15.159> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
about the mandible and actions of the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.399 
about the mandible and actions of the
scapula<00:01:15.729> I<00:01:15.759> may<00:01:15.999> say<00:01:16.289> elevation<00:01:17.289> and

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
scapula I may say elevation and

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
scapula I may say elevation and
depression<00:01:17.439> elevate<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.429> bringing<00:01:18.759> up

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
depression elevate is bringing up

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.080 
depression elevate is bringing up
depression<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.170> pulling<00:01:20.710> down<00:01:20.850> alright<00:01:21.850> let's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
depression is pulling down alright let's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.620 
depression is pulling down alright let's
get<00:01:22.210> started

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
get started

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.419
