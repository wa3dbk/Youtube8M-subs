 device the asus and have some 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.159
 weekdays in the market so like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.520
 32 which is what we have on the table and 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.870
 I think you can also find it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.660
 16 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.480
 4 gb in processors we have an intel 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.250
 atom and has a very good price for 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.940
 the technical characteristics offered 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.950
 this this good mobile let's start 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.710
 open the box and we see what the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.380
 device 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 As you can see, the box is different from what 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.600
 we are used to has a format 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.130
 horizontal and it's a little cardboard that 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.450
 covers the box where the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.270
 mobile 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.820
 a series of perforations that good what 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.920
 what it does is cover some 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.510
 specifications that the mobile phone has as 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.780
 you can see 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.780
 4g there you see it full hd bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 well let's open it here we have 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.570
 the mobile as you see comes with a plastic 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.930
 that covers the entire terminal let's see 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.930
 yes I can 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.379
 and we see what it contains in the box 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.670
 well here we have a protector that we 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.599
 includes the store never comes bad 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 we have the quick start life and the the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.260
 guarantee that he offers to his we have the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.890
 data cable 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.439
 and we have the power adapter as 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.450
 you see we have an adapter to fit it 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.180
 in the adapter and that is already valid 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.640
 for our country in this case Spain you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.610
 I am going to say that it is in the exit of 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.709
 this one of this charger is 135 amps 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.750
 a little low for my taste the cen 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.099
 funds has a measure of 15 2 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.709
 centimeters high 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.000
 77 2000 meters wide and 10.9 meters 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.849
 millimeters thick 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.439
 all in 170 grams in terms of 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.599
 technical specifications has a 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.170
 5.5 inch screen 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.680
 ips with full hd resolution a processor 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.260
 intel atom quad core to 18 gigahertz and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.220
 4 gigas of ram an internal storage 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 16 32 and 64 GB expandable by micro 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.889
 sd a 5 megapixel front camera 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.500
 and back of 13 and a 3000 battery 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.940
 milliamperes let's see how is this in 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.650
 funds in the top we 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.180
 we found with the headset we have the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.950
 classroom camera notifications to the 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.799
 right the sensors to the left and 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.329
 we have the asus logo in silver 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.680
 this device does not have the buttons 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.359
 included in the screen 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.859
 it's becoming fashionable lately 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.750
 almost all the devices in almost 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.609
 all the brands but it has them 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.950
 out kick 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.599
 and multitasking we also have a small 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.659
 embellisher very similar to the one I had 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.920
 the 3 axis at the top we 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.780
 we found with the microphone of 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.689
 cancel the power off button and 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.690
 power on and the headphone port 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.980
 as you can see 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.530
 the left side we have nothing 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.860
 lower part we have the microphone and the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.139
 entry for the microusb cable and in the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.820
 right side we find nothing 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.209
 we do not have a small search either 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.680
 which will help us to remove the lid in 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.270
 the back what we hide is 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.639
 the main camera above centered 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.350
 we have a double double-tone flash and 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.780
 we have the volume buttons as well 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.729
 that has the 3 axis buttons you have to 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.040
 say they have a kind of engraving 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.639
 also in the form of a circle there you can 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.470
 hear it 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.090
 We have the logo of asus the logo 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.789
 of intel which is the processor of the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.980
 terminal and we have the speaker down on 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.050
 big 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.730
 this is a sim dual terminal and as such 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.620
 at the time of removing the lid what we 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.380
 we found is a pair of slots for 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.230
 two micro sim one of them with only two 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.720
 g and the other with up to 4 g too 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.610
 we have a third slot that is for 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.240
 the introduction of the micro sd card 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.300
 which was very very good 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.830
 good we turn on the phone so you see 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.100
 like that 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.960
 we have a double vibration at the beginning 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.420
 we return the asus logo and I have to 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.980
 to say that finishing has come to me 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.500
 couple of hours so I had no chance 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.920
 still to prove it I will do a review 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.410
 extensive terminal and I will give my 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.000
 final impressions and good so that 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.590
 you can have an idea if it deserves 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.230
 it or not but for the price it has 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.169
 and on paper it's very very good 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.830
 Pinta 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.139
 It is a terminal that is around 350 euros 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.300
 this model of 4 gigas the other is 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.979
 Quite cheaper than 2 gigs 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.999
 but but I'm telling you it's a price 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.560
 pretty pretty economical for how it 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.969
 as it is on paper then we will see 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.490
 how it works, although I do not think 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.240
 is good fraud well here we have the 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.240
 configuration 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.180
 let's do everything very fast 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.949
 we skip everything 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:18.979
 and we are already in transfer you 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.979
 we say no 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.699
 and we are already at the desk of the 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.699
 terminal 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.140
 well as I say I have not had time to 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.630
 try it out so I can not give any 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.970
 objective opinion on how to 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.520
 unwraps the mobile so nothing in 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.550
 future media because one more noise 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.100
 tense of the terminal and we'll see if those 4 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.320
 gigas of ram is noticed as much as 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.880
 they stand out on paper so nothing 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.880
 we see in the next video see you later
