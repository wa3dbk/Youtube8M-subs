in one point eight point three you can
no<00:00:02.580> longer<00:00:02.790> break<00:00:03.120> bedrock<00:00:03.360> by<00:00:03.810> growing<00:00:04.080> oak

no longer break bedrock by growing oak
trees<00:00:06.470> so<00:00:07.470> if<00:00:07.710> you're<00:00:07.859> stuck<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> top<00:00:08.639> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
trees so if you're stuck on the top of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.430 
trees so if you're stuck on the top of
the<00:00:08.880> ceiling<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.360> nether<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.870> only<00:00:10.320> way

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
the ceiling on the nether the only way

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
the ceiling on the nether the only way
to<00:00:10.500> get<00:00:10.679> down<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.160> by<00:00:11.400> building<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.849> portal<00:00:12.210> but

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
to get down is by building a portal but

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900 
to get down is by building a portal but
if<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.349> don't<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.070> flint<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.429> steel<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
if you don't have a flint and steel to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.970 
if you don't have a flint and steel to
light<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> or<00:00:15.630> any<00:00:16.020> obsidian<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.710> build<00:00:16.890> a

light it or any obsidian to build a
portal<00:00:19.730> you're<00:00:20.730> pretty<00:00:21.000> much<00:00:21.060> stuck<00:00:21.539> that's

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
portal you're pretty much stuck that's

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.920 
portal you're pretty much stuck that's
why<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> designed<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.519> bedrock<00:00:24.210> door<00:00:24.510> that'll

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
why I designed this bedrock door that'll

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.779 
why I designed this bedrock door that'll
allow<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.949> through<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> ceiling

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
allow you to go down through the ceiling

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
allow you to go down through the ceiling
of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> nether<00:00:27.330> by<00:00:27.810> pressing<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> button<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
of the nether by pressing the button and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
of the nether by pressing the button and
holding<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.429> click<00:00:34.520> it's<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.820> simple

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
holding right click it's really simple

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880 
holding right click it's really simple
and<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:36.809> sure<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> figured<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.590> how<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and I'm sure you figured out how it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
and I'm sure you figured out how it
works<00:00:38.070> already<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.300> horse<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
works already it's just a horse in a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
works already it's just a horse in a
mine<00:00:39.870> cart<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.309> pistons<00:00:41.309> extend<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> line

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
mine cart and pistons extend the line

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.729 
mine cart and pistons extend the line
card<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> horse<00:00:43.260> pokes<00:00:43.620> through

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
card up so that the horse pokes through

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
card up so that the horse pokes through
the<00:00:44.010> bedrock<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.120> click<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the bedrock then you can click on the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.060 
the bedrock then you can click on the
horse<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> Pistons<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.739> retract

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
horse and the Pistons will retract

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
horse and the Pistons will retract
pulling<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> back<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.420> through<00:00:48.930> the

pulling you back down through the

pulling you back down through the
ceiling<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.399> horse<00:00:50.640> does<00:00:50.910> take<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> little

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
ceiling the horse does take a little

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
ceiling the horse does take a little
damage<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.110> they<00:00:52.620> regenerate<00:00:53.190> health

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
damage but they regenerate health

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
damage but they regenerate health
however<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.510> their<00:00:55.050> regeneration<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
however because their regeneration is a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
however because their regeneration is a
lot<00:00:56.219> slower<00:00:56.430> than<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.879> player's<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.660> may<00:00:57.840> want

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
lot slower than a player's you may want

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.860 
lot slower than a player's you may want
to<00:00:58.109> keep<00:00:58.379> some<00:00:58.739> food<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.309> hand<00:00:59.579> sugar<00:01:00.329> seems<00:01:00.660> to

to keep some food on hand sugar seems to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
to keep some food on hand sugar seems to
be<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> cheapest<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.100> feed<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> horse<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
be the cheapest to feed the horse to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.160 
be the cheapest to feed the horse to
regenerate<00:01:03.750> itself<00:01:05.299> didn't<00:01:06.299> work<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.630> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
regenerate itself didn't work because in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
regenerate itself didn't work because in
the<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> took<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.130> me<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> tell<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the time it took for me to tell you that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.090 
the time it took for me to tell you that
the<00:01:09.420> horses<00:01:09.750> help<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.080> already<00:01:10.260> regenerated

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the horses help had already regenerated

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
the horses help had already regenerated
but<00:01:11.549> still<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> lot<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.020> want

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
but still if you use this a lot you want

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100 
but still if you use this a lot you want
to<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.380> sure<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.770> horse<00:01:13.979> doesn't<00:01:14.250> die

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
to make sure the horse doesn't die

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.870 
to make sure the horse doesn't die
speaking<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.159> also<00:01:17.460> use<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
speaking of which you can also use this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
speaking of which you can also use this
to<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.180> above<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.780> ceiling<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:22.100> but

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to get above the ceiling like so but

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 
to get above the ceiling like so but
because<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.759> horse<00:01:23.939> takes<00:01:24.270> damage<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.840> might

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
because the horse takes damage you might

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
because the horse takes damage you might
want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> use<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.890> method<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.909> allows<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
want to use this method which allows you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.130 
want to use this method which allows you
to<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:33.479> video<00:01:33.869> I'm

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to get up but not down in this video I'm

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
to get up but not down in this video I'm
going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> show<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> build<00:01:35.340> both<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
going to show you how to build both the

two-way bedrock door which is of my own

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.550 
two-way bedrock door which is of my own
design<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> uses<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> horse<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.720> minecart<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.470> a

around for a while and doesn't use any
redstone<00:01:46.829> whatsoever<00:01:47.490> I'll<00:01:48.360> start<00:01:48.720> off<00:01:48.840> with

redstone whatsoever I'll start off with

the one-way door since it's a lot

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
the one-way door since it's a lot
simpler<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.659> need<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
simpler all you need is one of

and<00:02:54.260> place<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.680> piston<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.670> here<00:02:57.239> all<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and place one piston right here all the

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.310 
and place one piston right here all the
Pistons<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.590> need<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.070> sticky<00:03:00.110> next<00:03:01.110> we're

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
Pistons of need to be sticky next we're

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.229 
Pistons of need to be sticky next we're
going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.560> build<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.980> activation<00:03:02.640> line<00:03:02.820> in

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
going to build the activation line in

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.390 
going to build the activation line in
the<00:03:03.600> way<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> built<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.860> also<00:03:05.190> needs

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the way I built it here this also needs

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.060 
the way I built it here this also needs
a<00:03:05.820> space<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.320> below<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.590> ceiling

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
a space that is one below the ceiling

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
a space that is one below the ceiling
and<00:03:08.400> another<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.660> one<00:03:09.840> will<00:03:10.019> go<00:03:10.110> right

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
and another that is one will go right

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.229 
and another that is one will go right
next<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.250> torch<00:03:11.519> doesn't<00:03:11.730> burn<00:03:12.030> out

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
next to it so the torch doesn't burn out

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.569 
next to it so the torch doesn't burn out
you<00:03:12.840> really<00:03:13.200> only<00:03:13.380> need<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.040> these<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.459> it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
you really only need one of these and it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.280 
you really only need one of these and it
doesn't<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.239> directly<00:03:15.720> next<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
doesn't have to be directly next to the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.680 
doesn't have to be directly next to the
block<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.280> put<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> button<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.299> some

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
block if you put the button on some

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.750 
block if you put the button on some
other<00:03:18.840> space<00:03:19.230> somewhere<00:03:19.650> else<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.549> press

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
other space somewhere else you can press

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.759 
other space somewhere else you can press
it<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.840> move<00:03:22.079> over<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> where

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
it and then just move over to the where

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.650 
it and then just move over to the where
the<00:03:22.890> horse<00:03:23.100> goes<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.519> all<00:03:23.760> you'll<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.450> do

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
the horse goes up all you'll have to do

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.479 
the horse goes up all you'll have to do
is<00:03:24.900> connect<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> wiring<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.190> for<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
is connect the wiring but for the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.670 
is connect the wiring but for the
purpose<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:26.970> tutorial<00:03:27.329> I'm<00:03:27.900> going<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
purpose of this tutorial I'm going to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.699 
purpose of this tutorial I'm going to
just<00:03:28.950> assume<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.519> flat<00:03:29.790> surface<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.720> so

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
just assume a flat surface like this so

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.180 
just assume a flat surface like this so
you'll<00:03:32.310> start<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:32.850> with<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.720> block<00:03:34.079> here<00:03:34.380> with

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you'll start out with a block here with

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.000 
you'll start out with a block here with
redstone<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.810> torch<00:03:37.260> here<00:03:37.500> then

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
redstone on top of it a torch here then

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.949 
redstone on top of it a torch here then
you'll<00:03:38.430> need<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> block<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.060> doesn't<00:03:39.780> stick

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
you'll need a block that doesn't stick

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.740 
you'll need a block that doesn't stick
to<00:03:39.989> slime<00:03:40.350> blocks<00:03:40.650> below<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.670> with<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.570> dot

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
to slime blocks below it here with a dot

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.880 
to slime blocks below it here with a dot
of<00:03:42.780> redstone<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:45.030> torch<00:03:45.329> like<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.019> now

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
of redstone and a torch like this now

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.490 
of redstone and a torch like this now
this<00:03:47.340> will<00:03:47.610> power<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.540> slime<00:03:48.930> block<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
this will power the slime block and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.220 
this will power the slime block and
therefore<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> piston<00:03:50.760> when<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.299> extends<00:03:51.900> so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
therefore the piston when it extends so

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.289 
therefore the piston when it extends so
you<00:03:52.290> will<00:03:52.470> need<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.829> place<00:03:53.070> one<00:03:53.489> button<00:03:53.820> right

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
you will need to place one button right

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.440 
you will need to place one button right
below<00:03:54.329> here<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.320> redirect<00:03:55.650> redstone

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
below here just to redirect redstone

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.140

next<00:03:57.450> go<00:03:57.660> over<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.109> this<00:03:58.230> piston<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.060> built<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
next go over to this piston and built to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.900 
next go over to this piston and built to
box<00:04:00.510> out<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:01.170> this

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
box out like this

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.090 
box out like this

and then go over here build out like
this<00:04:08.670> put<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.840> torch<00:04:10.140> here<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:11.550> dot<00:04:11.730> of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
this put a torch here and a dot of

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.960 
this put a torch here and a dot of
redstone<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.710> now<00:04:13.710> your<00:04:13.950> activation<00:04:14.340> line<00:04:14.700> is

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
redstone and now your activation line is

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.300 
redstone and now your activation line is
finished<00:04:15.330> all<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.840> need<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.410> go<00:04:16.980> up<00:04:17.100> to

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
get your horse in position because the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.310 
get your horse in position because the
soul<00:04:29.850> sand<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> little<00:04:30.660> bit<00:04:30.780> lower<00:04:30.960> than<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
soul sand is a little bit lower than the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.200 
soul sand is a little bit lower than the
blocks<00:04:31.500> around<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.460> minecart<00:04:32.880> will<00:04:33.030> stay

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
blocks around it the minecart will stay

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.360 
blocks around it the minecart will stay
in<00:04:33.330> place<00:04:33.360> once<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.140> top<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.070> need<00:04:35.250> to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
in place once it's on top so you need to

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.100 
in place once it's on top so you need to
surround<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:35.880> blocks<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.570> don't<00:04:36.840> stick

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
surround it with blocks that don't stick

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.650 
surround it with blocks that don't stick
to<00:04:37.290> slime<00:04:37.500> blocks<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.100> then<00:04:38.850> just<00:04:39.150> bring<00:04:39.390> in

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
to slime blocks and then just bring in

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.710 
to slime blocks and then just bring in
your<00:04:39.870> horse<00:04:40.110> my<00:04:40.380> card<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.940> use<00:04:42.240> some<00:04:42.390> powered

rails<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.290> get<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.650> top<00:04:43.890> put<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.520> block<00:04:44.880> to

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
rails to get it on top put the block to

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.760 
rails to get it on top put the block to
prevent<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.480> from<00:04:45.570> going<00:04:45.780> too<00:04:46.050> far<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.880> power

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
prevent it from going too far and power

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.530 
prevent it from going too far and power
i'll<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:50.040> sum<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.640> horse<00:04:50.910> here<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:53.540> push

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
i'll just sum in a horse here and push

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.470 
i'll just sum in a horse here and push
it<00:04:54.690> on<00:04:54.810> now<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.770> minecart<00:04:56.520> should<00:04:56.820> be<00:04:56.970> stuck

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
it on now the minecart should be stuck

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.510 
it on now the minecart should be stuck
in<00:04:57.630> place<00:05:03.530> one<00:05:04.530> more<00:05:04.740> thing<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.100> need<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.280> make

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
in place one more thing you need to make

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.130 
in place one more thing you need to make
sure<00:05:05.550> before<00:05:06.030> using<00:05:06.450> this<00:05:06.690> is<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.050> you

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
sure before using this is that you

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.140 
sure before using this is that you
actually<00:05:07.350> tain<00:05:07.890> your<00:05:08.130> horse<00:05:08.340> if<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.940> just

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
actually tain your horse if you just

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.760 
actually tain your horse if you just
snatch<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.570> out<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.930> wild<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.470> put<00:05:10.680> it

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
snatch it out of the wild and put it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.650 
snatch it out of the wild and put it
here<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:11.250> might<00:05:11.520> kick<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.790> off<00:05:12.090> while<00:05:12.479> you're

here it might kick you off while you're
riding<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.169> so<00:05:13.560> just<00:05:13.830> keep<00:05:13.979> mounting<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.580> until

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
riding it so just keep mounting it until

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.909 
riding it so just keep mounting it until
you<00:05:14.940> see<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.240> hard<00:05:15.479> particles<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:16.169> then

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
you see the hard particles and then

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.510 
you see the hard particles and then
you'll<00:05:17.070> be<00:05:17.100> done<00:05:18.650> finally<00:05:19.650> if<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.220> want<00:05:20.430> to

you'll be done finally if you want to
use<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.640> to<00:05:20.880> get<00:05:21.000> on<00:05:21.180> top<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.750> nether<00:05:21.930> like

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
use it to get on top of the nether like

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.390 
use it to get on top of the nether like
I<00:05:22.380> did<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.770> beginning<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.310> video

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
I did at the beginning of the video

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.159 
I did at the beginning of the video
you'll<00:05:24.060> need<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.300> put<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.810> button<00:05:25.050> that

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
you'll need to put a button that

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.230 
you'll need to put a button that
activates<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:26.190> redstone<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.090> can

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
activates this redstone that you can

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.140 
activates this redstone that you can
reach<00:05:27.450> from<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:28.020> top<00:05:28.229> of<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.500> horse<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.820> put

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
reach from the top of the horse so I put

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.469 
reach from the top of the horse so I put
one<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:31.080> right<00:05:31.290> over<00:05:31.590> here<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:35.240> now<00:05:36.240> when

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
one just right over here and now when

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.909 
one just right over here and now when
you<00:05:36.690> get<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:38.070> can<00:05:38.340> press<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:39.800> get<00:05:40.800> up

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
you get on you can press it and get up

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.940 
you get on you can press it and get up
to<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.160> top<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.870> way<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.110> get<00:05:43.500> off<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.800> horse

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
to the top the way you get off the horse

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.190 
to the top the way you get off the horse
you<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:44.610> have<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.820> hit<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.120> timing<00:05:45.510> right<00:05:45.540> so

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
you just have to hit the timing right so

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.170 
you just have to hit the timing right so
when<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:46.620> mount<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:47.040> you<00:05:47.370> want<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.669> shift<00:05:47.880> when

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
when you mount it you want to shift when

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.820 
when you mount it you want to shift when
it's<00:05:48.300> at<00:05:48.479> its<00:05:48.510> highest<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:49.140> you'll<00:05:49.590> just

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
it's at its highest and you'll just

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.560 
it's at its highest and you'll just
automatically<00:05:50.430> be<00:05:50.669> placed<00:05:50.850> on<00:05:51.180> top<00:05:51.390> of<00:05:51.510> the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
automatically be placed on top of the

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.719 
automatically be placed on top of the
bedrock<00:05:51.930> like<00:05:52.350> so<00:05:57.979> now<00:05:58.979> I'm<00:05:59.130> just<00:05:59.280> going<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.640> go

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
bedrock like so now I'm just going to go

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.480 
bedrock like so now I'm just going to go
over<00:05:59.850> briefly<00:06:00.330> which<00:06:00.840> blocks<00:06:01.169> can<00:06:01.650> be<00:06:01.710> bedrock

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
over briefly which blocks can be bedrock

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.670 
over briefly which blocks can be bedrock
hanging<00:06:02.880> down<00:06:03.090> and<00:06:03.390> which<00:06:03.690> blocks<00:06:03.990> have<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.560> be

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
hanging down and which blocks have to be

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.120 
hanging down and which blocks have to be
one<00:06:05.100> block<00:06:05.340> below<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.940> roof<00:06:06.169> so<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.620> one<00:06:07.830> with

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
one block below the roof so the one with

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.070 
one block below the roof so the one with
the<00:06:08.160> horse<00:06:08.400> obviously<00:06:09.150> has<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.360> be<00:06:09.600> one<00:06:09.870> block

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
the horse obviously has to be one block

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.890 
the horse obviously has to be one block
below<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.830> roof<00:06:11.010> and<00:06:11.250> in<00:06:12.000> this<00:06:12.510> building

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
below the roof and in this building

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.260 
below the roof and in this building
right<00:06:12.990> here<00:06:13.050> these<00:06:13.860> two<00:06:13.919> blocks<00:06:14.460> also<00:06:14.940> have<00:06:15.150> to

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
right here these two blocks also have to

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.610 
right here these two blocks also have to
be<00:06:15.360> open<00:06:15.630> because<00:06:15.810> if<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.080> can<00:06:16.200> place<00:06:16.349> a<00:06:16.380> block

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
be open because if you can place a block

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.500 
be open because if you can place a block
here<00:06:16.680> it'll<00:06:17.070> burn<00:06:17.310> out<00:06:17.490> and<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:18.060> Steep<00:06:18.270> needs

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
here it'll burn out and the Steep needs

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.630 
here it'll burn out and the Steep needs
to<00:06:18.630> be<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.840> red<00:06:18.990> stone<00:06:19.229> but<00:06:19.830> if<00:06:20.099> you<00:06:20.220> only<00:06:20.370> have

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
to be the red stone but if you only have

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.969 
to be the red stone but if you only have
the<00:06:20.820> one<00:06:20.970> block<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:21.750> can<00:06:21.990> of<00:06:22.169> course<00:06:22.200> move<00:06:22.800> the

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
the one block you can of course move the

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.159 
the one block you can of course move the
wiring<00:06:23.400> so<00:06:23.760> if<00:06:23.910> you<00:06:24.030> remove<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.510> here<00:06:24.840> then

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
wiring so if you remove this here then

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.100 
wiring so if you remove this here then
you<00:06:25.380> can<00:06:25.410> safely<00:06:25.770> have<00:06:26.130> this<00:06:26.490> be<00:06:26.729> one<00:06:26.940> and<00:06:27.180> you

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
you can safely have this be one and you

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.080 
you can safely have this be one and you
would<00:06:28.260> have<00:06:28.349> to<00:06:28.530> move<00:06:28.650> this<00:06:28.770> input<00:06:29.010> as<00:06:29.280> well<00:06:29.310> so

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
would have to move this input as well so

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.870 
would have to move this input as well so
say<00:06:30.599> if<00:06:30.840> you<00:06:30.900> have<00:06:31.169> another<00:06:31.620> space<00:06:32.010> with<00:06:32.580> one

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
say if you have another space with one

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.990 
say if you have another space with one
over<00:06:33.419> here<00:06:33.660> you<00:06:34.260> can<00:06:34.500> place<00:06:34.860> your<00:06:35.010> button<00:06:35.310> go

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
over here you can place your button go

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.950 
over here you can place your button go
down<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.630> and<00:06:36.930> place<00:06:37.710> your<00:06:38.340> redstone<00:06:38.910> and<00:06:39.240> then

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
down to and place your redstone and then

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.740 
down to and place your redstone and then
you<00:06:40.289> would<00:06:40.410> just<00:06:40.560> need<00:06:40.830> to<00:06:41.130> line<00:06:41.880> it<00:06:41.910> up<00:06:42.180> so

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
you would just need to line it up so

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.529 
you would just need to line it up so
that<00:06:43.080> input<00:06:43.950> goes<00:06:44.099> into<00:06:44.370> here<00:06:44.640> which<00:06:44.880> I<00:06:45.120> can't

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
that input goes into here which I can't

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.180 
that input goes into here which I can't
place<00:06:45.720> a<00:06:45.750> block<00:06:46.020> right<00:06:46.289> now<00:06:46.470> because<00:06:46.979> of<00:06:47.010> the

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
place a block right now because of the

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.190 
place a block right now because of the
horse<00:06:47.460> but<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.210> get<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.390> idea<00:06:48.510> you<00:06:49.110> would

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
horse but you get the idea you would

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.690 
horse but you get the idea you would
just<00:06:49.410> point<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.710> red<00:06:49.860> stone<00:06:50.070> into<00:06:50.400> the<00:06:50.520> block

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
just point the red stone into the block

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.510 
just point the red stone into the block
or<00:06:50.910> if<00:06:51.599> there's<00:06:51.930> bedrock<00:06:52.410> here<00:06:52.680> as<00:06:52.919> well<00:06:53.070> you

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
or if there's bedrock here as well you

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.730 
or if there's bedrock here as well you
could<00:06:53.700> use<00:06:53.910> a<00:06:53.940> repeater<00:06:54.479> and<00:06:57.349> that's<00:06:58.349> it<00:06:58.560> for

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
could use a repeater and that's it for

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.620 
could use a repeater and that's it for
this<00:06:58.830> tutorial<00:06:59.010> if<00:06:59.640> you<00:07:00.090> can<00:07:00.270> think<00:07:00.390> of<00:07:00.510> a<00:07:00.599> way

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
this tutorial if you can think of a way

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.210 
this tutorial if you can think of a way
that<00:07:00.990> we<00:07:01.110> can<00:07:01.200> get<00:07:01.349> down<00:07:01.560> from<00:07:01.740> the<00:07:01.890> roof<00:07:01.979> than

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
that we can get down from the roof than

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.040 
that we can get down from the roof than
other<00:07:02.430> with<00:07:03.060> something<00:07:03.450> that<00:07:03.570> doesn't<00:07:03.900> take

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
other with something that doesn't take

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.050 
other with something that doesn't take
suffocation<00:07:04.740> damage<00:07:05.070> I'd<00:07:05.280> be<00:07:05.430> glad<00:07:05.550> to<00:07:05.669> hear

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
suffocation damage I'd be glad to hear

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.270 
suffocation damage I'd be glad to hear
it<00:07:06.150> but<00:07:06.840> until<00:07:07.080> then<00:07:07.410> I<00:07:07.470> think<00:07:07.860> this<00:07:08.010> is<00:07:08.160> the

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
it but until then I think this is the

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.000 
it but until then I think this is the
best<00:07:08.400> we<00:07:08.610> go<00:07:08.820> so<00:07:09.690> thanks<00:07:10.260> for<00:07:10.410> watching<00:07:10.800> and<00:07:10.950> I

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
best we go so thanks for watching and I

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.060 
best we go so thanks for watching and I
will<00:07:11.039> see<00:07:11.250> you<00:07:11.400> all<00:07:11.520> next<00:07:11.700> time
