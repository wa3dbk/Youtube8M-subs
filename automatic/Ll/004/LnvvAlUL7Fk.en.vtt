it and I think this would be pretty over
top<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.739> it<00:03:46.209> but<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.480> don't<00:03:47.690> think<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.260> really

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
top of it but I don't think this really

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.930 
top of it but I don't think this really

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
to try these in a different shade the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.190 
to try these in a different shade the
