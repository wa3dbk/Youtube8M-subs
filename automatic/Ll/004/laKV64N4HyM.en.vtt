00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
before you go in a long dive because you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.620 
before you go in a long dive because you
want<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.460> make<00:02:14.610> sure<00:02:14.640> everything's<00:02:15.270> angle

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
angle but just play with it so it's the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.470
