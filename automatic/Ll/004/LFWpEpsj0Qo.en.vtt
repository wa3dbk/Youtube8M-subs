like it'll go up so like 85 90 you know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
like it'll go up so like 85 90 you know
100<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> stuff<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
100 and stuff like that so that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.740 
100 and stuff like that so that's
basically<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.719> these<00:02:01.820> armor<00:02:02.820> casings<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
basically what these armor casings of to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660 
basically what these armor casings of to
upgrade<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.200> armor<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> scabbards<00:02:05.490> are

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
to upgrade the weapons and you will see

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.809 
to upgrade the weapons and you will see
that<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.869> upgrades<00:02:10.259> 90<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> 100<00:02:11.700> this

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
that it upgrades 90 to 100 this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.280 
that it upgrades 90 to 100 this
particular<00:02:12.150> one

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
particular one

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.550 
particular one
anyway<00:02:14.599> once<00:02:15.599> you've<00:02:15.780> got<00:02:15.989> all<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> those

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
anyway once you've got all of those

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
anyway once you've got all of those
things<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:17.219> basically<00:02:17.430> use<00:02:17.849> them<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
things and you basically use them to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.610 
things and you basically use them to
upgrade<00:02:18.420> them<00:02:18.599> then<00:02:18.780> you're<00:02:18.989> fully<00:02:19.170> upgraded

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
upgrade them then you're fully upgraded

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.709 
upgrade them then you're fully upgraded

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
look at them so that the game knows oh

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.929 
look at them so that the game knows oh
cool<00:02:52.169> you<00:02:52.319> have<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.889> then<00:02:53.609> they<00:02:53.700> should

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
cool you have them and then they should

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.509 
cool you have them and then they should
appear<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.720> here<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:56.099> should<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.400> an

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
appear in here you should get an

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.879 
appear in here you should get an
achievement<00:02:56.639> for<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.239> well<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:58.230> anyway<00:02:58.530> so

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
achievement for it as well but anyway so

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.770 
achievement for it as well but anyway so
once<00:02:59.579> you've<00:02:59.879> done<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.480> will<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
once you've done that you will have a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.629 
once you've done that you will have a
whole<00:03:00.989> bunch<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.290> ones<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.889> in<00:03:01.950> level<00:03:02.220> 90

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
whole bunch of ones that are in level 90

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.860 
whole bunch of ones that are in level 90
so<00:03:02.849> basically<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.359> have<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.720> upgrade

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
so basically you just have to upgrade

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.720 
so basically you just have to upgrade
them<00:03:04.319> once<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.919> then<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.069> will<00:03:05.220> upgrade<00:03:05.549> them

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
them once and then you will upgrade them

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.659 
them once and then you will upgrade them
to<00:03:05.939> level<00:03:06.239> 100<00:03:06.480> which<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.049> pretty<00:03:07.530> cool<00:03:07.769> and

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
to level 100 which is pretty cool and

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.280 
to level 100 which is pretty cool and
you<00:03:08.700> will<00:03:09.030> find<00:03:09.269> all<00:03:09.419> the<00:03:09.540> different<00:03:09.629> pages<00:03:09.989> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you will find all the different pages of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.929 
you will find all the different pages of
them<00:03:10.439> keep<00:03:10.889> in<00:03:11.010> mind<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:11.250> think<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.519> there<00:03:11.760> are

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
them keep in mind I think that there are

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.069 
them keep in mind I think that there are
now<00:03:12.299> more<00:03:14.209> heirlooms<00:03:15.209> seeing<00:03:15.659> as<00:03:15.750> they<00:03:15.900> seem

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
now more heirlooms seeing as they seem

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.170 
now more heirlooms seeing as they seem
to<00:03:16.109> have<00:03:16.260> added<00:03:16.650> necklaces<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.819> main<00:03:18.000> thing

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
to have added necklaces the main thing

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.969 
to have added necklaces the main thing
about<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.510> necklace<00:03:18.930> seems<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.799> they

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
about the necklace seems to be that they

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.559 
about the necklace seems to be that they
can<00:03:20.989> no<00:03:21.989> useable<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.790> can<00:03:23.940> actually<00:03:24.269> use

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
can no useable so you can actually use

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.869 
can no useable so you can actually use
the<00:03:24.810> necklace<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.379> get<00:03:25.500> healed<00:03:25.799> for<00:03:26.159> just

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
the necklace to get healed for just

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.819 
the necklace to get healed for just
because<00:03:27.180> or<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.329> give<00:03:27.479> you<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.599> heal<00:03:28.079> basically

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
because or to give you a heal basically

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.399 
because or to give you a heal basically
which<00:03:29.489> could<00:03:30.000> probably<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.359> useful<00:03:30.690> while

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
which could probably be useful while

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.750 
which could probably be useful while
leveling<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.010> they<00:03:32.099> should<00:03:32.250> scale<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.639> as

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
leveling and they should scale up as

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.300 
leveling and they should scale up as
well<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.209> there<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.900> go<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.889> go
