drop<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> heat<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.829> means<00:00:34.860> your<00:00:35.190> heart

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
drop in the heat which means your heart

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
drop in the heat which means your heart
needs<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> work<00:00:36.030> harder<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
needs to work harder to make up for it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
needs to work harder to make up for it
if<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.590> dehydrated<00:00:37.969> then<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
if you're dehydrated then you have a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.440 
if you're dehydrated then you have a
less<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.649> less<00:00:40.860> blood<00:00:41.040> volume<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:42.000> also

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
less you have less blood volume so also

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.580 
less you have less blood volume so also
that<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.780> tend<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> bring<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> blood

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
that will tend to bring the blood

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
that will tend to bring the blood
pressure<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.030> why<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.690> we

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
pressure down and that's why like we

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
pressure down and that's why like we
said<00:00:46.020> people<00:00:46.289> might<00:00:46.440> faint<00:00:46.770> or<00:00:47.399> feel<00:00:47.730> kind<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
said people might faint or feel kind of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
said people might faint or feel kind of
tired<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.629> dizzy<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.620> their

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
tired or dizzy that's because their

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.709 
tired or dizzy that's because their
blood<00:00:49.950> pressure<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> getting<00:00:50.850> low<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
blood pressure is getting low if that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
blood pressure is getting low if that
workout<00:00:52.020> seems<00:00:52.320> harder<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
workout seems harder that's because it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.939 
workout seems harder that's because it
is<00:00:53.910> too<00:00:54.600> hard<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.379> could<00:00:55.559> experience

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
is too hard and you could experience

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
is too hard and you could experience
exertional<00:00:56.730> heat<00:00:56.789> stroke<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.750> they're

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
exertional heat stroke if they're

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
exertional heat stroke if they're
running<00:00:58.829> into<00:00:58.980> problems<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.670> fluid<00:01:00.149> balance

running into problems with fluid balance
or<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.309> electrolytes<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.359> get

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
or with electrolytes then they can get

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.929 
or with electrolytes then they can get
muscle<00:01:04.019> cramps<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.769> common<00:01:05.339> early<00:01:05.640> sign
