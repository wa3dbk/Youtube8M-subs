we're<00:00:02.070> often<00:00:02.190> faced<00:00:02.700> with<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.270> paradox<00:00:03.810> when<00:00:03.990> we

we're often faced with a paradox when we

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.099 
we're often faced with a paradox when we
design<00:00:04.609> to<00:00:05.609> make<00:00:05.759> products<00:00:06.270> smaller<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
design to make products smaller and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.830

maintain<00:00:17.880> its<00:00:18.119> battery<00:00:18.480> life<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.230> can
