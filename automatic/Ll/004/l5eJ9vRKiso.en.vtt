with respect to the number 10 in the
ones<00:00:16.109> column<00:00:17.119> all<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.869> now

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
ones column all right so here we go now

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.620 
ones column all right so here we go now
this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.130> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> fun<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.910> think

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this is this is a lot of fun and I think

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.050 
this is this is a lot of fun and I think
you're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> enjoy<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:27.619> more<00:00:28.619> than<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
you're going to enjoy this more than the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
you're going to enjoy this more than the
addition<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.630> different<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
addition because it's different and it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979 
addition because it's different and it
gets<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> point<00:00:33.840> out

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
gets you to think now just to point out

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.100 
gets you to think now just to point out
even<00:00:34.350> though<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.620> using<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:36.329> ones<00:00:36.690> column

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
even though we're using the ones column

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350 
even though we're using the ones column
and<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> past<00:00:38.040> we've<00:00:38.250> only<00:00:38.460> always<00:00:39.120> used

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and in the past we've only always used

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990 
and in the past we've only always used
the<00:00:39.540> ones<00:00:39.780> column<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.500> point<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.640> since

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the ones column at this point but since

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
the ones column at this point but since
we're<00:00:42.239> doing<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.899> numbers<00:00:43.469> these<00:00:43.800> problems

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
we're doing these numbers these problems

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
we're doing these numbers these problems
with<00:00:44.610> respect<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> number<00:00:45.750> 10<00:00:46.110> we're

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
with respect to the number 10 we're

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
with respect to the number 10 we're
going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.940> using<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.510> bit

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
going to have be using a little bit

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.860 
going to have be using a little bit
because<00:00:48.930> we're<00:00:49.170> doing<00:00:49.379> subtraction<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
because we're doing subtraction so the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.930 
because we're doing subtraction so the
first<00:00:52.199> problem<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
first problem that we're going to do is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
first problem that we're going to do is
10<00:00:54.710> minus<00:00:55.710> 7<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.750> with

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
10 minus 7 so we're going to start with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
10 minus 7 so we're going to start with
the<00:00:58.109> number<00:00:58.440> 10<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.160> abacus<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.430> we<00:01:02.430> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the number 10 on our abacus and we are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.329 
the number 10 on our abacus and we are
going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> subtract<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> number<00:01:04.739> 7

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going to subtract from that the number 7

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
going to subtract from that the number 7
well<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> 7<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> ones<00:01:07.140> column<00:01:07.369> we

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
well the 7 is in the ones column we

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
well the 7 is in the ones column we
don't<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.850> enough<00:01:09.150> beads<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> take

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
don't have enough beads there to take

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.090 
don't have enough beads there to take
that<00:01:10.290> away<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:12.290> remember<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.740> we've

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that away from it so remember you we've

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
that away from it so remember you we've
done<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> exactly<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.509> we've<00:01:15.659> done

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
done this exactly the same as we've done

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.100 
done this exactly the same as we've done
before<00:01:16.670> when<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:18.000> complements<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
before when we're using complements and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.039 
before when we're using complements and
we're<00:01:19.650> subtracting<00:01:20.000> we're<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> add<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
we're subtracting we're going to add the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.760 
we're subtracting we're going to add the
complement<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:23.490> right<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.770> we're

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
complement all right so here we go we're

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
complement all right so here we go we're
doing<00:01:25.950> subtraction<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.759> compliment<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
doing subtraction the compliment to the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
doing subtraction the compliment to the
number<00:01:27.960> 7<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.280> number<00:01:31.340> did<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> say<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
number 7 is the number did you say it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
number 7 is the number did you say it
out<00:01:32.759> loud<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.979> did<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:36.240> 3<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
out loud can you get it did I it's 3 the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.710 
out loud can you get it did I it's 3 the
compliment<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> number<00:01:38.820> 7<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.299> 3<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
compliment to the number 7 is 3 so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.940 
compliment to the number 7 is 3 so
here's<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.700> add<00:01:41.970> 3<00:01:42.810> slide<00:01:43.619> 3

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
here's what we do is we add 3 slide 3

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
here's what we do is we add 3 slide 3
towards<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> beam<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> take

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
towards the beam and we're going to take

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.539 
towards the beam and we're going to take
that<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:47.070> away<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.420> tens<00:01:48.720> column<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> 10

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that one away in the tens column so 10

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.389 
that one away in the tens column so 10
minus<00:01:50.880> 7<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.659> 3<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.890> works

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
minus 7 is 3 I can see that that works

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.920 
minus 7 is 3 I can see that that works
yeah<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
yeah we can do this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
yeah we can do this
let's<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.619> another<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.340> similar<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
let's do another one kind of similar to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
let's do another one kind of similar to
that<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.630> 10<00:02:01.280> minus<00:02:02.280> 6<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.439> your

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that let's do is 10 minus 6 and in your

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
that let's do is 10 minus 6 and in your
head<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.430> probably<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
head I know you can probably do this but

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.609 
head I know you can probably do this but
it'll<00:02:06.960> we're<00:02:07.770> learning<00:02:08.060> abacus<00:02:09.060> brain<00:02:09.619> so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it'll we're learning abacus brain so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.619 
it'll we're learning abacus brain so
here<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.099> 10<00:02:11.900> minus<00:02:12.900> 6

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
here we go 10 minus 6

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.239 
here we go 10 minus 6
this<00:02:13.989> says<00:02:14.349> ten<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.219> zero<00:02:15.609> and<00:02:17.249> we

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 
this says ten and one is zero and we

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.489 
this says ten and one is zero and we
don't<00:02:18.549> have<00:02:18.849> six<00:02:19.329> beads<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.959> take<00:02:20.170> away<00:02:20.439> from

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
don't have six beads to take away from

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.530 
don't have six beads to take away from
here<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.760> would<00:02:21.939> have<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.299> number

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
here there would have to be a number

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.030 
here there would have to be a number
bigger<00:02:23.139> than<00:02:23.319> 6

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
bigger than 6

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.729 
bigger than 6
in<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:25.090> ones<00:02:25.420> column<00:02:25.749> to<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.409> but

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
in this ones column to do that but

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.539 
in this ones column to do that but
there's<00:02:26.889> a<00:02:26.950> zero<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.079> do<00:02:29.139> we<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.439> we<00:02:29.950> add

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
there's a zero so what do we do we add

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.209 
there's a zero so what do we do we add
the<00:02:30.790> compliment<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.480> compliment<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
the compliment the compliment to the

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.080 
the compliment the compliment to the
number<00:02:33.549> six<00:02:33.909> is<00:02:34.530> four<00:02:35.530> all<00:02:36.489> right<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.909> means

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
number six is four all right that means

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.459 
number six is four all right that means
we<00:02:37.420> slide<00:02:38.260> four<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.209> take<00:02:40.209> away<00:02:40.419> this<00:02:41.139> bead

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
we slide four up and take away this bead

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:49.250 
we slide four up and take away this bead
in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> tens<00:02:41.980> column<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.569> 10<00:02:44.139> minus<00:02:45.129> 6<00:02:45.639> is<00:02:45.969> 4

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.559 

all<00:02:50.260> right<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.859> can<00:02:51.489> see<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.909> wheels<00:02:52.060> starting

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
all right I can see the wheels starting

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.679 
all right I can see the wheels starting
to<00:02:52.659> turn<00:02:52.870> here<00:02:53.169> we<00:02:53.349> go<00:02:53.530> let's<00:02:53.889> do<00:02:54.099> one<00:02:54.449> just<00:02:55.449> a

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
to turn here we go let's do one just a

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.199 
to turn here we go let's do one just a
tad<00:02:56.620> bit<00:02:56.650> no<00:02:57.069> it's<00:02:57.099> not<00:02:57.370> any<00:02:57.579> harder<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:58.120> is

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
tad bit no it's not any harder which is

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.740 
tad bit no it's not any harder which is
different

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
different

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.089 
different
let's<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.379> 11<00:03:00.540> minus<00:03:01.540> 8<00:03:02.280> 11<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.579> 1<00:03:03.969> and<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.569> 1

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
let's do 11 minus 8 11 is a 1 and a 1

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.649 
let's do 11 minus 8 11 is a 1 and a 1
that's<00:03:06.099> how<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.310> write<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.639> number<00:03:06.879> 11<00:03:07.239> 1<00:03:07.449> and

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
that's how you write the number 11 1 and

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.409 
that's how you write the number 11 1 and
1<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.109> we're<00:03:08.829> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.189> subtract<00:03:09.849> from<00:03:10.359> that

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
1 and we're going to subtract from that

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.069 
1 and we're going to subtract from that
the<00:03:11.049> number<00:03:11.799> 8<00:03:12.010> 11<00:03:12.790> minus<00:03:13.150> 8<00:03:13.359> so<00:03:13.719> here<00:03:13.930> we<00:03:14.049> are

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
the number 8 11 minus 8 so here we are

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.709 
the number 8 11 minus 8 so here we are
in<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.349> ones<00:03:14.530> column<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.189> we<00:03:16.120> don't<00:03:16.449> have

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:16.719 
in the ones column and we don't have

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.219 
in the ones column and we don't have
enough<00:03:17.169> beads<00:03:17.949> there<00:03:18.159> we<00:03:18.280> only<00:03:18.430> have<00:03:18.639> one<00:03:19.229> so

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
enough beads there we only have one so

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.869 
enough beads there we only have one so
we've<00:03:20.409> got<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.650> use<00:03:20.769> complementary<00:03:21.220> numbers

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
we've got to use complementary numbers

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:29.300 
we've got to use complementary numbers
and<00:03:22.259> the<00:03:23.259> compliment<00:03:23.919> to<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.280> number<00:03:24.639> 8<00:03:24.849> is<00:03:26.790> 2

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and the compliment to the number 8 is 2

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.869 
and the compliment to the number 8 is 2
that<00:03:30.310> means<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:30.729> add<00:03:30.909> 2<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:32.859> added<00:03:33.340> 2<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
that means we add 2 so I added 2 to the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.030 
that means we add 2 so I added 2 to the
ones<00:03:34.090> column<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.959> I'm<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.379> to<00:03:35.439> subtract

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
ones column and I'm going to subtract

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.270 
ones column and I'm going to subtract
this<00:03:36.400> bead<00:03:36.729> in<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.209> tens<00:03:37.479> column<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.739> 11<00:03:39.250> minus

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
this bead in the tens column so 11 minus

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.969 
this bead in the tens column so 11 minus
8<00:03:39.939> is<00:03:40.180> 3<00:03:42.659> all<00:03:43.659> right<00:03:43.810> here<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.079> go<00:03:44.259> the<00:03:44.500> next<00:03:44.769> one

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
8 is 3 all right here we go the next one

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:50.550 
8 is 3 all right here we go the next one
12<00:03:45.909> minus<00:03:46.329> 9<00:03:48.060> there's<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.509> number<00:03:49.870> 12<00:03:50.199> on<00:03:50.439> our

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
12 minus 9 there's the number 12 on our

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.439 
12 minus 9 there's the number 12 on our
abacus<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:51.250> we're<00:03:51.400> going<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.699> subtract<00:03:52.209> from

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
abacus and we're going to subtract from

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.949 
abacus and we're going to subtract from
that<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.720> number<00:03:53.079> 9<00:03:53.609> not<00:03:54.609> enough<00:03:54.909> beads<00:03:55.180> that

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
that the number 9 not enough beads that

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.990 
that the number 9 not enough beads that
means<00:03:56.169> we<00:03:56.319> add<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.069> compliment<00:03:57.669> the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
means we add the compliment the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.189 
means we add the compliment the
compliment<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> number<00:03:59.169> 9<00:03:59.379> is<00:03:59.650> 1<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.019> we

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
compliment to the number 9 is 1 and we

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.360 
compliment to the number 9 is 1 and we
take<00:04:02.409> away<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.680> right<00:04:03.129> there<00:04:04.349> 12<00:04:05.349> minus<00:04:05.799> 9<00:04:06.099> is

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
take away that right there 12 minus 9 is

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.270 
take away that right there 12 minus 9 is
what<00:04:06.939> do<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.090> have<00:04:07.209> left<00:04:07.590> 3<00:04:10.829> now<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:11.889> know<00:04:12.039> you're

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
what do we have left 3 now I know you're

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.740 
what do we have left 3 now I know you're
getting<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.639> probably<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.209> piece<00:04:13.449> of<00:04:13.629> cake

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
getting this is probably a piece of cake

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.330 
getting this is probably a piece of cake
let's<00:04:14.019> just<00:04:14.169> do<00:04:14.319> like<00:04:14.500> 2<00:04:14.799> more<00:04:15.039> and<00:04:15.189> I<00:04:15.280> think

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
let's just do like 2 more and I think

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.020 
let's just do like 2 more and I think
you'll<00:04:15.669> have<00:04:15.819> it<00:04:16.060> let's<00:04:17.019> do<00:04:17.190> 17<00:04:18.190> minus<00:04:18.759> 9

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
you'll have it let's do 17 minus 9

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.510 
you'll have it let's do 17 minus 9
let's<00:04:19.389> try<00:04:19.599> that<00:04:19.949> one<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.549> 7<00:04:22.060> 17<00:04:23.050> minus<00:04:23.949> 9

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
let's try that one and a 7 17 minus 9

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.090 
let's try that one and a 7 17 minus 9
well<00:04:25.419> nines<00:04:25.690> are<00:04:25.930> easy

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
well nines are easy

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.670 
well nines are easy
subtraction<00:04:28.060> because<00:04:28.420> all<00:04:28.600> we<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.990> do<00:04:29.200> is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
subtraction because all we have to do is

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.910 
subtraction because all we have to do is
add<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.610> one<00:04:31.360> there<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.810> take<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.560> one

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
add that one there and take that one

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.040 
add that one there and take that one
away<00:04:33.010> there<00:04:34.050> 17<00:04:35.050> minus<00:04:35.650> 9<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:37.170> 8<00:04:39.000> piece<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.210> cake

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
away there 17 minus 9 is 8 piece of cake

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.030 
away there 17 minus 9 is 8 piece of cake
oh<00:04:41.610> that's<00:04:42.610> fun<00:04:43.030> all<00:04:43.930> right<00:04:44.140> one<00:04:44.440> last<00:04:44.680> one<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
oh that's fun all right one last one and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.490 
oh that's fun all right one last one and
I<00:04:45.250> think<00:04:45.340> you'll<00:04:45.730> have<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.500> subtraction

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
I think you'll have this subtraction

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.710 
I think you'll have this subtraction
using<00:04:48.220> complementary<00:04:48.730> numbers<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.540> tens

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
using complementary numbers in the tens

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.190 
using complementary numbers in the tens
column

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
column

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.510 
column
let's<00:04:50.380> do<00:04:50.530> 12<00:04:51.240> minus<00:04:52.240> 8<00:04:53.070> all<00:04:54.070> right<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.400> let's

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
let's do 12 minus 8 all right so let's

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.840 
let's do 12 minus 8 all right so let's
put<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.760> number<00:04:55.000> 12<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.450> here<00:04:55.770> 12<00:04:56.770> minus<00:04:57.190> 8<00:04:57.340> we

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
put the number 12 on here 12 minus 8 we

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.460 
put the number 12 on here 12 minus 8 we
don't<00:04:58.030> have<00:04:58.180> enough<00:04:58.510> we<00:04:58.720> know<00:04:58.900> we<00:04:59.050> need<00:04:59.170> to<00:04:59.230> new

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
don't have enough we know we need to new

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.600 
don't have enough we know we need to new
use<00:04:59.860> complementary<00:05:00.340> numbers<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.860> complement

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
use complementary numbers the complement

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.360 
use complementary numbers the complement
to<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.820> number<00:05:04.120> 8<00:05:04.360> is<00:05:04.630> 2<00:05:05.230> and<00:05:06.160> we're

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
to the number 8 is 2 and we're

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.210 
to the number 8 is 2 and we're
subtracting<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.990> means<00:05:08.200> we<00:05:08.350> add<00:05:08.890> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
subtracting so that means we add the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.450 
subtracting so that means we add the
complement<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:09.990> then<00:05:10.990> take<00:05:11.800> away<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.220> beat

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
complement and then take away that beat

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.450 
complement and then take away that beat
in<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.730> tens<00:05:12.970> column<00:05:13.440> 12<00:05:14.440> minus<00:05:14.980> 8<00:05:15.130> is<00:05:15.490> 4<00:05:17.400> now<00:05:18.400> I

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
in the tens column 12 minus 8 is 4 now I

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.420 
in the tens column 12 minus 8 is 4 now I
know<00:05:18.550> you're<00:05:18.820> getting<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:20.430> was

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
know you're getting this and that was

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.880 
know you're getting this and that was
probably<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:22.150> piece<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.540> cake<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.470> I

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
probably a piece of cake for you and I

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.620 
probably a piece of cake for you and I
know<00:05:23.950> you'll<00:05:24.250> get<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.790> let's<00:05:25.000> let's<00:05:25.480> go

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630

through the problem fly through because

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.240 
through the problem fly through because
you<00:05:30.220> probably<00:05:30.430> will<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.210> it's<00:05:32.080> it's<00:05:32.350> fun<00:05:32.770> the
