then get off to the outside and then we

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.680 
then get off to the outside and then we
can<00:00:57.809> execute<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.829> open<00:00:59.160> field<00:00:59.370> tackle<00:00:59.460> in<00:01:00.030> that

got chin our helmet under chin he's
getting<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> hammer<00:01:09.000> technique

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
getting off this is hammer technique

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
getting off this is hammer technique
because<00:01:09.689> he's<00:01:09.840> attacking<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.680> the

getting tackled or he's throwing a move
that<00:01:15.780> cuts<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:16.890> thing

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that cuts back and that's the only thing

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
that cuts back and that's the only thing
that<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:17.939> happen<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
key to hammer technique okay once again

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
key to hammer technique okay once again
