dawn and from there my Edition just blew
and<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.340> think<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.760> kind<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.120> obvious<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and I think it's kind of obvious not so

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.400 
and I think it's kind of obvious not so
much<00:02:33.459> now<00:02:33.879> but<00:02:34.840> when<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.049> look<00:02:35.140> at<00:02:35.290> my

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
much now but when you look at my

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.729 
much now but when you look at my
childhood<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> think<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.340> kind<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.610> obvious<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
childhood I think it's kind of obvious I

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.979 
childhood I think it's kind of obvious I
was<00:02:38.739> addicted<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.129> comic<00:02:40.120> books<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.569> things<00:02:40.780> I

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
was addicted to comic books and things I

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.259 
was addicted to comic books and things I
mean<00:02:41.200> every<00:02:41.410> little<00:02:41.440> kid<00:02:41.829> obviously<00:02:42.269> like

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
mean every little kid obviously like

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.670

superheroes<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.140> yet<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.290> meet<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.560> little

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
superheroes I have yet to meet a little

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
superheroes I have yet to meet a little
boy<00:02:44.890> who<00:02:45.129> doesn't<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.790> people<00:02:49.590> were

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
boy who doesn't but these people were

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.550

beyond<00:02:51.010> idols<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.609> me<00:02:52.470> beyond<00:02:53.470> God's<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:55.560> I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
beyond idols to me beyond God's and I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.930 
beyond idols to me beyond God's and I
think<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.190> really<00:02:58.230> shows<00:02:59.549> when<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.670> look<00:03:00.819> at

think that really shows when you look at
me<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.810> little<00:03:02.049> kid<00:03:03.660> yeah<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:05.200> skirt<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> little

could and I think some of that is

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.539 
could and I think some of that is
probably<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:53.019> naturally<00:03:53.709> me<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> suspect

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
probably just naturally me but I suspect

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.599 
probably just naturally me but I suspect
the<00:03:58.060> vast<00:03:58.359> majority<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:59.200> it<00:04:00.000> comes<00:04:01.000> from<00:04:02.609> my

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
the vast majority of it comes from my

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.210 
the vast majority of it comes from my
obsession<00:04:04.599> my<00:04:04.810> fascination<00:04:07.139> with
