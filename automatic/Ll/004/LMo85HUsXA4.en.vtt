three weeks you begin to see that that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460 
three weeks you begin to see that that
is<00:02:48.160> moving<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.940> flattening<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.290> just

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
is moving and flattening so it's just

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.280 
is moving and flattening so it's just
like<00:02:50.620> any<00:02:50.799> other<00:02:51.010> muscle<00:02:51.129> or<00:02:51.700> area<00:02:52.090> where<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
like any other muscle or area where the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.890 
like any other muscle or area where the
stronger<00:02:54.099> gets<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.489> tighter<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.879> exactly<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
stronger gets the tighter it exactly and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.869 
stronger gets the tighter it exactly and
that's<00:02:56.349> what<00:02:56.500> about<00:02:56.890> my<00:02:57.099> program<00:02:57.400> facial

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
that's what about my program facial

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.910 
that's what about my program facial
magic<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.359> creates<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.049> contraction<00:02:59.709> in<00:02:59.829> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
magic it creates a contraction in the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.800 
magic it creates a contraction in the
muscle<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.430> when<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:00.730> muscle<00:03:00.940> contracts<00:03:01.569> it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
muscle and when that muscle contracts it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.349 
muscle and when that muscle contracts it
begins<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.440> shorten<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.640> when<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.909> shortens

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
begins to shorten and when it shortens

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.229 
begins to shorten and when it shortens
because<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> face<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.560> neck<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.400> skin<00:03:06.970> is

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
because in the face and neck the skin is

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.940 
because in the face and neck the skin is
attached<00:03:07.540> directly<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.319> muscle<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:08.920> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
attached directly to the muscle so it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.399 
attached directly to the muscle so it
lifts<00:03:09.670> tattles<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.239> all<00:03:10.359> up<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.810> always<00:03:11.049> try

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
lifts tattles it all up then always try

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.080 
lifts tattles it all up then always try
to<00:03:11.440> squeeze<00:03:11.709> in<00:03:11.890> one<00:03:12.040> more<00:03:12.099> what<00:03:12.459> okay<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:12.940> do
