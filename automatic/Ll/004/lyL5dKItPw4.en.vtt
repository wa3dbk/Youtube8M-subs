your body weight for example if you
weigh<00:01:20.700> 200<00:01:21.030> pounds<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> formula<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
weigh 200 pounds the formula would be

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.179 
weigh 200 pounds the formula would be
200<00:01:23.820> times<00:01:23.970> 10<00:01:24.659> plus<00:01:25.700> 200<00:01:26.700> times<00:01:27.090> 2<00:01:27.450> thus<00:01:28.189> 2,000

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
200 times 10 plus 200 times 2 thus 2,000

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
200 times 10 plus 200 times 2 thus 2,000
plus<00:01:29.750> 400<00:01:30.750> equals<00:01:31.610> 2,400<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.299> need<00:01:33.560> 2400

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
plus 400 equals 2,400 you will need 2400

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
plus 400 equals 2,400 you will need 2400
calories<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.460> about<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.119> routine

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

functions<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:37.860> women<00:01:38.250> multiply<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.090> weight

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
functions for women multiply your weight

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.170 
functions for women multiply your weight
times<00:01:39.720> 10<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.710> add<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.460> original<00:01:41.970> weight

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
times 10 then add your original weight

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.710 
times 10 then add your original weight
so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> weigh<00:01:43.290> 120<00:01:44.280> pounds<00:01:44.729> multiply<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so if you weigh 120 pounds multiply that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.660 
so if you weigh 120 pounds multiply that
by<00:01:45.780> 10<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:47.040> 1200<00:01:47.520> plus<00:01:48.680> 120<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.430> will

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
by 10 you get 1200 plus 120 you will

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.319 
by 10 you get 1200 plus 120 you will
need<00:01:51.110> 1320<00:01:52.110> calories<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.759> should<00:01:53.970> add<00:01:54.149> the
