 d 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.540
 d 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.949
 Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.039
 two 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.439
 let's work on this green book that the supermarket 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.920
 d the season 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 in which a little is to analyze our eating behavior and for marin 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.610
 several tips on how we can improve the nose to the food industry the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.220
 way in which we eat what we eat that advised us at the time of eating 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.880
 and there are several ideas that is very good 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.719
 in none of them is that ever in the history of ed we have needed nobody 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.720
 tell what we have to eat but thanks to the revolution and the passage of 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.900
 time we have been determining what foods 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.870
 percent of the aid in pocono supermarket what advises 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 is that you do not buy anything that your great grandmother cooperates 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.680
 percent did not recognize on the shoulders a carrot would recognize 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.390
 and certain products processed for having no idea what they are 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.749
 the advised path that you do not buy any product you have 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.909
 the eternal analyst dm ingredients 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.370
 and especially ingredients that you do not know not 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.200
 and the truth is that it is very curious 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.940
 and good the number 2 of almerÃ­a one must of aneto 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.670
 per cent that attacks 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.890
 and I always say that it is that the price not food not processed not p what with 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 three the raw material and that the kitchen is a man makes you want 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.720
 we do not all have the time or the will to do it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.810
 and it's worth 2 3% work product very well and already if we take 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.200
 any of the products are not quite bombed 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.580
 we will go the list of ingredients we do not recognize anyway this is a 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.490
 caradura to the sport 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.060
 we do not recognize him that he has 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.520
 there were chicken and onions and carrots in the village 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 it has enough with fresh and has a sprig of on foot that this one because they do not have 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.329
 neither salt nor any other ingredient 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.100
 and they are all more or less similar 10 and that is a very interesting product 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.690
 because to generate time you must prepare your position because to him 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.120
 by the way said cox for the paella 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.549
 and they are all with natural ingredients and even with some 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.549
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969
 they are even organic products 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.889
 and good today the accountant spoke with a strap for the keys 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.839
 the place a dry rice 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:18.379
 it is very simple and the participants of the dakar with the explanation of turns 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.040
 recovered middleton and from the editorial good copper and some brand not os 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.619
 worry that I will tell you 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.629
 Well the first thing is to have a paella because the broken one should always be done 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.939
 so long do not stop at most two of the data because if it does not boil 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.239
 uniformly a trickle of oil if we put cut majo in sheets 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.670
 and when it begins to take color we add the tomato if it is scratched and better if 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.599
 Remove that gestation lake because they are brought in please, we ask for a pinch of 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.599
 salt and let it sautÃ© until it takes color 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.389
 and it's time to add the paprika that time the raw paprika and the burnt 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.319
 they do not know very well how barracks to get the point 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.629
 two or three a couple of minutes if it's enough 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.569
 and it's time to add the rice that we're also going to suffer for both 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.359
 minutes 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.439
 it is important that but look historical and then three quieter with the 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.839
 cooking 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.510
 you have to have a broth sarkozy is already hot double the connection 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.959
 amount of rice and one half cost us a cover but we are going to put two places and 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.839
 half gareca play with the fire so that the request is uniform if you see that there is 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.049
 woman just by the center by another saying moving if it is to say that she no longer does 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.569
 the boat still needs to be moved 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.310
 Well, this is very basic 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.970
 so I think that fish rabbit chicken what I recommend is that the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.840
 gays before not before putting the garlic perkins the chicken the rabbit salpimentado 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.510
 region is the fish and then remove it airs make the sofrito 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.030
 tomato and then they rule it by hartmann as you see the superclassic last 18 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 approximately all the broth has been consumed and if it has not been 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.420
 consumed in desserts that climb the last two minutes the fire to butt and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.540
 if it has been consumed at 16 minutes I am willing too little equal 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.510
 it is very hot outside closed the speakers dt forget them the prof yes that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.199
 it's a thing of playing with time and fire 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.559
 and also you like it to the dente because they will be 18 minutes they like it a little 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.919
 more after notice about 20 minutes as much even if it's still hard and 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.349
 ampa only 18 minutes even broth you can cover it with a rag 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.719
 from the treasurer rose what's left of Carlos, I hope we're given a 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.629
 hug until then
