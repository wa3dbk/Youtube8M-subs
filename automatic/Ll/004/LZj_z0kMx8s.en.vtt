00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:08.149
 another day with the staff is the same 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.809
 of the route your town of mathematics 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.030
 all today I bring you houses that kings 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.290
 against the diraya something to whom all the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.990
 previous always contrary being that 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.490
 never never never 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 I have not fought nor will I fight to the hundred 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.219
 per cent I imagined it to be held 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.410
 hands of this uncle because not the first 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.780
 that is so difficult and second that no 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.550
 I'm fighting one hundred percent because I 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.500
 what I try is to do everything by combining 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 all the operations that I can 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 and all the attacks that they can so that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.339
 see what removes everything and more or 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.449
 less what each one does but good 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.449
 here we are 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.930
 can not keep it 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.730
 Well, if he left the game he saw 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.730
 improved game 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 far 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.830
 so it's covered long distance 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.720
 as well 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.820
 it's quite complete this character 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.550
 About distance with samples already 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.330
 we know it's pretty fast and here's the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.330
 whatever distance the beam 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 i 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.899
 it's a character we're 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.039
 so I 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.460
 especially 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.659
 I want it not after depositing the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.659
 waist but all 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.740
 in the mean of 18 station that ends 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.330
 with fireball there are also many 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.330
 others end up condori 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:42.360
 as you see the sword and we are going above all 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 far 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.890
 so he said for example online is a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.440
 character that conditioned you enough 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.210
 good so it's all light 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.140
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.140
 goodbye
