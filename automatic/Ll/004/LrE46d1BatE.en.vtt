so<00:01:34.280> far<00:01:34.390> nothing<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.659> doesn't<00:01:35.869> go<00:01:35.930> well

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
so far nothing if it doesn't go well

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.050 
so far nothing if it doesn't go well
then<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.560> doesn't<00:01:36.799> go<00:01:36.890> well<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:37.280> think<00:01:37.729> if<00:01:37.970> I

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
then and it doesn't go well I think if I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.550 
then and it doesn't go well I think if I
go<00:01:38.180> off<00:01:38.270> tonight<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.720> I'll<00:01:38.840> be<00:01:38.960> absolutely

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
buzzing about it but I'm not putting any

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.779 
buzzing about it but I'm not putting any
pressure<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.320> myself<00:01:42.470> I'm<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.310> going<00:01:43.670> with
