00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.590
With the release of the FX100, AMPLIFi is
now a family, and all the members of that family

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.770
share the same control via mobile devices
with the AMPLIFi Remote app,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.180
so today I want to show that to you on an iPad.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.920
The first  time you launch the AMPLIFi app, it's going

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.170
to ask you to sign into your Line6.com account.
This is so you can participate in all the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.270
cloud-based behavior of the app.
Sign in with your account if you have one.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.660
If you don't have one, you can just hit the
button to create one on the spot. Once you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.719
do, this is what you'll see. On the left-hand
side, this is your menu structure. AMPLIFi

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.620
Remote, I'm signed into my Sean Halley account
online. This is my music library. It's a brand

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.239
new iPad, so I have no music yet. Any music
that you have on your device, the cover art

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.940
will show up here, as you expect it to.
Below that, you have My Tones. These are the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.649
tones that are stored on your account online.
Any device that you sign into with your account,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.969
you will see these same tones. I will see
these on my phone as well. I can also do things

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.789
like tone search, so I can just do a search
for Hendrix, for instance.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.800
You can see that the community has done a ton of work for you already in trying to find great Hendrix sounds.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.500
If you want to, you can simply just touch
one of these and load a sound.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.280
Below that you'll find the icon for the hardware
you have connected to the AMPLIFi Remote,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.290
either the AMPLIFi 75, the AMPLIFi 150 or
the FX100. I've got an AMPLIFi 150 today.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.750
This is where you're going to see 100 presets.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980
There are 25 banks of 4 sounds.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.380
You don't have to use your mobile device to control the amp. After you've got it set up,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.000
you can just use the foot controller.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.200
After that you have the editor. We'll get to that in a second.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.440
After that you have the tuner.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.260
After that you have the master level.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.980
You can see there's 2 values here because there's actually a separate volume for the guitar

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.880
versus how loud the amp is.
If you're playing around with music in your

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.880
library and you want to be able to mix yourself
against whatever the song is, you can do it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.070
right here. It's the same thing as hitting
that volume knob on the AMPLIFi hardware.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.870
When it's red, it's the overall volume. When
you push it, you see the other color,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.410
that's the guitar volume.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.280
Then you have the editor.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.459
From left to right, you've got the guitar input, then a gate, a wah, a stomp block, the amp and the cabinet

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.939
and then the stuff after the amp: a compressor,
an EQ, a volume pedal, and then a modulation

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.709
block and a delay block and a reverb block.
These 2 guys can actually be moved before

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.519
or after the amp, which I'll show you in a
minute.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.759
The first sound is a top boost clean.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.939
Now we can start swapping out individual components

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.239
and changing the tone. If I want to take that
top boost and turn it into something a little

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.879
bit more aggressive, just come over here to
your amp icon. You can see there are 4 types

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.189
of amps, 4 classes: Clean, American, British
and High Gain.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:06.079
If we go back to British, where we were, but go from the top boost to more of a Plexi,

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.119
now it's doing this. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.320
Cool. 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.640
We can save it there and change the cab.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.340
Same idea.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.140
We'll go with the 20.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.780
We can also change the mic position. 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.580
Let's start looking at other types of blocks.
You've got the delay block. If I turn it on,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.620
there's a digital delay in there now.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.920
If you want to change that, you can hit the same

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.890
icon that you've been hitting before, go to
analog delay with modulation, and you get this.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.420
Just a cool sound.
Let's say we went to the stomp block.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.760
At the moment, I've got this sound ... This is as much crunch as I have out of that Plexi,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.640
which is cool, but I want to add some more dirt. If I just turn on the screamer that's there already...

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.560
Problem though is that that pedal traditionally has a bunch of low end rolled out of it, so

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.320
that the distortion remains clean. If you
want to change that to something a little more gnarly, 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.380
something much more fuzzy...

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.900
Fun.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.020
We can also ... Let's mute that for a second, turn the fuzz off. We've also got a modulation

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.050
block here that in the spirit of this Hendrixian thing has a U-vibe in there.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.400
You notice that modulation block is after the amp. It's going to sound very different if I put

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.340
it before the amp. You see ... Then just drag it over.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.220
Now it's in front of the amp, it sounds different.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.840
Now all of that modulation is getting distorted the same way the guitar  is.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.080
If I pull some of the depth, pull some
of the mix out a little bit, speed it up and

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.640
then turn that fuzz back on,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.060
then we get '60s' Brown chaos.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.480
If you like it, it's very easy to save it.
All you have to do is hit the Save Info button,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.060
so you can see a bunch of information about the tone: the title of it, who the author is ... 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.860
This is me, obviously ... The song,
who the guitarist is, information like what

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.680
kind of sound, what kind of instruments, what
pickup position perhaps, what kind of pickup.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.990
You can see here, it says, "Field required
to publish tone." If you want to be able to

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.000
share this tone with the wider community,
you have to fill out all of these fields,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.520
so that AMPLIFi Remote knows how to search
for the tone that you've shared.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:36.760
Once you've got it where you like ... Let's
see. I'm going to call this Funky 25 Fuzz Lead.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.180
Now I say Save Tones. You can see it
gives me an option. It can just Save As a

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.770
new name or save to my tones. If I say save to my tones, it saves it to the cloud, to

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.310
my account. At that point, I can load that
sound on any device that I am signed into.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.560
Once you've saved it to your account, AMPLIFi
Remote has the ability to share it or publish

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.900
it with the wider world. If you hit the share
button here, you can see that you can publish

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.250
it to the wider Line 6 community. You can
also tweet it or post it to your Facebook

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.850
timeline. You can use your favorite social
media sites to be able to share your tone

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.710
with followers, friends or colleagues.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.820
You can see that AMPLIFi Remote is a fun and

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.440
intuitive way to control your entire guitar
life. It doesn't matter if you have an FX100,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:27.000
a 75 or a 150, the entire family responds
to the same version of the app and the same presets.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.220
Head on over the Line6.com, hit the dealer locator.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.180
Find a dealer in your area with one
in stock, and then head up to the app store.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.300
Download the free AMPLIFi Remote app and take it and your mobile device with you to the store.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.120
Thanks and cheers.
