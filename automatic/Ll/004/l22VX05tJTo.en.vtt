I went ahead and did swatches and posted
those<00:00:27.269> yesterday<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:29.000> let's<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
those yesterday and let's just kind of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350 
those yesterday and let's just kind of
get<00:00:30.660> into<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.619> 15<00:00:32.009> shadows<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
get into it so it's 15 shadows of the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.729 
get into it so it's 15 shadows of the
permanent<00:00:33.809> line<00:00:34.260> from<00:00:34.770> Mac<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.660> they<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.590> think

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
permanent line from Mac and they I think

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
permanent line from Mac and they I think
they<00:00:38.010> listed<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.809> like<00:00:39.809> best<00:00:40.110> selling

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
they listed them as like best selling

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
they listed them as like best selling
shades<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.370> most<00:00:41.969> likely<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.660> probably<00:00:42.989> have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
shades so most likely you probably have

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.610 
shades so most likely you probably have
heard<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.539> may<00:00:45.750> own<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> good

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I believe that's where everything is the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.450 
I believe that's where everything is the
only<00:01:26.790> ones<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.619> sure<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.070> our

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
only ones I'm kind of not sure about our
Omega<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.549> wedge<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.329> wedge<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Omega and wedge I think wedge is the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.469 
Omega and wedge I think wedge is the
warmer<00:01:34.229> colored<00:01:34.560> 1<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.040> Omega<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> cooler

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

kind<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> shimmery<00:02:19.629> shade<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.439> it<00:02:20.620> would

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
kind of shimmery shade that it would

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.319 
kind of shimmery shade that it would
really<00:02:21.069> be<00:02:21.659> very<00:02:22.799> creamy<00:02:23.799> not<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.879> much<00:02:25.060> I

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
really be very creamy not so much I

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.229 
really be very creamy not so much I
don't<00:02:25.930> know<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.590> would<00:02:26.950> hope<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.280> these<00:02:27.849> are

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
don't know I would hope that these are

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.869 
don't know I would hope that these are
just<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.569> permanent<00:02:29.290> shadows<00:02:30.010> glued<00:02:30.459> into<00:02:30.700> a

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
just the permanent shadows glued into a

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.839 
just the permanent shadows glued into a
palette<00:02:31.389> and<00:02:31.540> sold<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:33.129> hope<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.579> I

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
palette and sold I really hope so I

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.089 
palette and sold I really hope so I
really<00:02:34.599> hope<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.049> they<00:02:35.200> didn't<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.769> anything

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
really hope that they didn't do anything

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.250 
really hope that they didn't do anything
different<00:02:36.760> than<00:02:37.120> they<00:02:37.329> normally<00:02:37.569> do<00:02:38.049> for

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
different than they normally do for

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.800 
different than they normally do for
their<00:02:38.409> regular<00:02:38.829> singles<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.450> never<00:02:40.569> know

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
their regular singles but you never know

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.849 
their regular singles but you never know
with<00:02:40.840> Mac<00:02:41.200> right<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.459> as<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.319> see<00:02:44.590> from

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
with Mac right so as you can see from

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.699 
with Mac right so as you can see from
the<00:02:45.069> palette<00:02:45.519> these<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.720> lot<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.230> these<00:02:47.349> shadows

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
the palette these a lot of these shadows

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.800 
the palette these a lot of these shadows
are<00:02:47.859> fairly<00:02:48.099> powdery<00:02:48.609> they<00:02:48.970> kick<00:02:49.209> up<00:02:49.389> a<00:02:49.540> fair

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
are fairly powdery they kick up a fair

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.550 
are fairly powdery they kick up a fair
amount<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.200> dust<00:02:50.379> when<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.159> are<00:02:51.310> using<00:02:51.489> them

the<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.340> only<00:02:54.579> shade<00:02:54.879> that<00:02:55.120> i<00:02:55.180> really<00:02:55.599> had

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
the the only shade that i really had

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.339 
the the only shade that i really had
difficulty<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.669> was<00:02:57.669> brung<00:02:58.209> even<00:02:58.840> with

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
difficulty with was brung even with

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.209 
difficulty with was brung even with
primer<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.450> very<00:03:01.870> thin<00:03:02.379> it<00:03:02.680> done<00:03:02.889> it

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:03.219 
primer it just it's very thin it done it

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.619 
primer it just it's very thin it done it
doesn't<00:03:03.700> pick<00:03:04.030> up<00:03:04.060> very<00:03:04.450> well<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:06.450> really<00:03:07.450> had

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
doesn't pick up very well I really had

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.119 
doesn't pick up very well I really had
to<00:03:07.659> build<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.079> up<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.409> I<00:03:08.530> wanted<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:08.889> get<00:03:09.069> that

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
to build it up if I wanted to get that

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.899 
to build it up if I wanted to get that
kind<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.549> full<00:03:09.909> intensity<00:03:11.489> carbon<00:03:12.489> actually

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
kind of full intensity carbon actually

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.670 
kind of full intensity carbon actually
worked<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.209> lot<00:03:13.359> better<00:03:13.419> over<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.989> primer<00:03:14.319> than

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
worked a lot better over a primer than

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.809 
worked a lot better over a primer than
brun<00:03:15.040> did<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:17.010> since<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.159> had<00:03:18.280> heard<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:18.729> many

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
brun did and since I had heard so many

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.969 
brun did and since I had heard so many
bad<00:03:18.940> things<00:03:19.150> about<00:03:19.569> carbon<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.409> maybe

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
bad things about carbon and maybe

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.289 
bad things about carbon and maybe
there's<00:03:21.280> been<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.519> lot<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.819> really<00:03:22.150> bad

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
there's been a lot of really bad

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.719 
there's been a lot of really bad

any sort of needs i have for a black i
would<00:03:38.949> prefer<00:03:39.159> something<00:03:39.699> more<00:03:39.909> on<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.449> gray

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
would prefer something more on the gray

would prefer something more on the gray
side<00:03:40.930> as<00:03:41.260> opposed<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> really<00:03:42.069> rich<00:03:42.489> dark

side as opposed to a really rich dark
black<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.449> that<00:03:43.599> is<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.370> with<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> bit

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
more fair skin it can get a little out

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.619 
more fair skin it can get a little out
of<00:03:47.439> control<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:48.280> that's<00:03:48.970> kind<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.209> how<00:03:49.329> i<00:03:49.389> feel

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
of control and that's kind of how i feel

of control and that's kind of how i feel
in<00:03:49.689> general<00:03:50.259> about<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.620> matte<00:03:50.769> shadows<00:03:51.189> i

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
in general about the matte shadows i

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.809 
in general about the matte shadows i
would<00:03:51.819> say<00:03:52.060> saddles<00:03:52.629> watched<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.470> best<00:03:53.819> i

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
would say saddles watched the best i

would say saddles watched the best i
used<00:03:55.449> what<00:03:56.259> i<00:03:56.290> believe<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.650> omega<00:03:57.220> in<00:03:57.459> my

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
used what i believe is omega in my

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.800 
used what i believe is omega in my
crease<00:03:57.879> today<00:03:58.209> and<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:01.209> did<00:04:01.479> take<00:04:01.780> some

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
crease today and it did take some

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.809 
crease today and it did take some
building<00:04:02.409> but<00:04:02.620> that's<00:04:02.829> personally<00:04:03.669> how<00:04:03.790> i

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
building but that's personally how i

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.479 
building but that's personally how i
prefer<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.479> use<00:04:04.629> crease<00:04:04.959> colors<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.709> i<00:04:06.069> was

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
prefer to use crease colors so i was

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
I think it might be a little

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.920 
I think it might be a little
disappointing<00:05:50.960> so<00:05:52.150> just<00:05:53.150> because<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
disappointing so just because the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.320 
disappointing so just because the
quality<00:05:54.200> on<00:05:54.500> these<00:05:54.950> is<00:05:55.280> definitely<00:05:55.880> not<00:05:56.090> in

line with the really kind of high and

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.110 
line with the really kind of high and
