but<00:00:12.419> we<00:00:12.660> really<00:00:12.929> need<00:00:12.959> some<00:00:13.230> rain<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.709> man

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
but we really need some rain here man

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.550 
but we really need some rain here man
that<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.660> can't<00:00:15.900> shoot<00:00:16.110> this<00:00:18.170> that<00:00:19.170> trough

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
that is we can't shoot this that trough

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980 
that is we can't shoot this that trough
is<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.450> there's<00:00:21.450> no<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
is just like a there's no water it's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
is just like a there's no water it's
just<00:00:22.050> dry<00:00:22.349> so<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.710> can't<00:00:22.919> do<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> we'll<00:00:23.310> come

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
just dry so we can't do that we'll come

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.819 
just dry so we can't do that we'll come
back<00:00:24.050> if<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.259> rains<00:00:25.500> hope<00:00:25.829> it<00:00:25.919> does<00:00:27.680> I'm<00:00:28.680> going

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
back if it rains hope it does I'm going

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.019 
back if it rains hope it does I'm going
to<00:00:28.890> grab<00:00:29.040> it<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> tilt-shift

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to grab it to tilt-shift

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.940 
to grab it to tilt-shift
and<00:00:30.419> go<00:00:30.570> over<00:00:30.719> that<00:00:30.869> way<00:00:33.530> just<00:00:34.530> need<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and go over that way just need the one

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.110 
and go over that way just need the one
lens<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:40.520> shot<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> scene<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
lens I shot this scene with a a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
lens I shot this scene with a a
telephoto<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> straight<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> de

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
telephoto like a straight to a de

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.270 
telephoto like a straight to a de
millimeter<00:00:44.190> last<00:00:44.399> time<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:46.129> I'm<00:00:47.129> shooting

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
millimeter last time and I'm shooting

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.819 
millimeter last time and I'm shooting
such<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:47.699> angle<00:00:47.999> that<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:49.140> wasn't<00:00:49.289> sharp<00:00:49.589> all

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
such an angle that it wasn't sharp all

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799 
such an angle that it wasn't sharp all
the<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.100> through<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.359> can't<00:00:51.539> because

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the way through because it can't because

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
the way through because it can't because
I'll<00:00:51.960> slow<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.589> focal<00:00:53.159> length<00:00:53.280> through<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I'll slow going focal length through the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.959 
I'll slow going focal length through the
lens

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
lens

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.649 
lens
but<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.589> tilt<00:00:55.859> shift<00:00:56.239> that<00:00:57.239> should<00:00:57.449> give<00:00:57.629> me

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
but the tilt shift that should give me

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.020 
but the tilt shift that should give me
some<00:00:57.749> razor-sharp<00:00:58.579> rocks<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> way

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
some razor-sharp rocks all the way

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.149 
some razor-sharp rocks all the way
through<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.539> front<00:01:00.749> to<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.350> then

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
through I from front to back and then

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.500 
through I from front to back and then
we'll<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.670> able<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> adjust<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.329> shutter

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we'll be able to adjust the shutter

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.880 
we'll be able to adjust the shutter
speed<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:03.960> different<00:01:04.140> water<00:01:04.379> exposures

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
speed to get different water exposures

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.330 
speed to get different water exposures
so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.139 

oh<00:01:09.369> yeah<00:01:10.030> that's<00:01:10.210> great<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.750> have<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:12.729> 85

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
oh yeah that's great I have a an 85

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.170 
oh yeah that's great I have a an 85
tilt-shift<00:01:13.630> on<00:01:14.110> here<00:01:14.380> which<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.710> Nikon<00:01:15.220> lens

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
tilt-shift on here which is a Nikon lens

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.730 
tilt-shift on here which is a Nikon lens
and<00:01:16.799> basically<00:01:17.799> it<00:01:18.189> enables<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.500> watch<00:01:20.500> this

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
and basically it enables you watch this

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.319 
and basically it enables you watch this
right<00:01:20.890> here

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
right here

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.870 
right here
what<00:01:22.329> that<00:01:22.450> does<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:24.100> will<00:01:24.250> alter<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.640> plane

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
what that does that will alter the plane

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.050 
what that does that will alter the plane
of<00:01:25.060> focus<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.689> I<00:01:25.720> can<00:01:26.020> actually<00:01:26.320> adjust<00:01:26.409> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
of focus so I can actually adjust this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.149 
of focus so I can actually adjust this
to<00:01:28.060> match<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.439> angle<00:01:29.770> off<00:01:29.830> shooting<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
to match the angle off shooting the

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.730 
to match the angle off shooting the
subject<00:01:30.670> at<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.840> get<00:01:31.990> maximum<00:01:32.350> sharpness

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
subject at to get maximum sharpness

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.190 
subject at to get maximum sharpness
without<00:01:33.130> stopping<00:01:33.490> all<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.670> way<00:01:33.789> down<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.140> I

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
without stopping all the way down so I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.160 
without stopping all the way down so I
can<00:01:35.350> shoot<00:01:35.500> at<00:01:35.679> several<00:01:36.070> F<00:01:36.579> stops<00:01:37.170> give

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
can shoot at several F stops give

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.590 
can shoot at several F stops give
various<00:01:38.500> speeds<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.039> water<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.479> get

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
various speeds of water and get

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.760 
various speeds of water and get
everything<00:01:43.810> razor<00:01:44.200> razor<00:01:44.770> sharp<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.470> we'll<00:01:47.619> do

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
everything razor razor sharp so we'll do

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.370 
everything razor razor sharp so we'll do
one<00:01:47.799> more<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:49.420> not<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.869> we'll<00:01:50.110> do<00:01:50.229> one

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
one more that's not that we'll do one

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.990 
one more that's not that we'll do one
more<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.179> you<00:01:52.270> look<00:01:52.420> at<00:01:52.509> this<00:01:52.689> one<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:54.000> like

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
more but if you look at this one a like

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.529 
more but if you look at this one a like
get<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:56.099> like<00:01:57.099> your<00:01:57.220> Photoshop<00:01:57.729> or<00:01:57.939> software<00:01:58.330> at

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
get a like your Photoshop or software at

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.339 
get a like your Photoshop or software at
100%<00:02:00.270> we'll<00:02:01.270> try<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.509> here<00:02:01.810> we'll<00:02:02.200> try<00:02:02.319> that

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
100% we'll try that here we'll try that

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.760 
100% we'll try that here we'll try that
here

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
here

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.679 
here
it'll<00:02:03.039> look<00:02:03.130> razor<00:02:03.399> sharp<00:02:03.789> because<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.599> that

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
it'll look razor sharp because of that

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.070 
it'll look razor sharp because of that
lens<00:02:05.459> let's<00:02:06.459> try<00:02:06.640> one<00:02:06.819> here<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.030> see<00:02:07.869> what<00:02:07.990> we

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
lens let's try one here and see what we

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.139 
lens let's try one here and see what we
have<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.410> we're<00:02:08.500> going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.679> go<00:02:08.799> in<00:02:09.149> histogram

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
have so we're going to go in histogram

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.120 
have so we're going to go in histogram
is<00:02:10.209> pretty<00:02:10.360> good<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.950> we're<00:02:11.950> going<00:02:12.069> to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
is pretty good on that we're going to

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.530 
is pretty good on that we're going to
magnify<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:15.150> look<00:02:16.150> at<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.390> detail<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:17.049> there

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
magnify it look at that detail in there

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.880 
magnify it look at that detail in there
that's<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.660> very<00:02:19.930> high<00:02:20.109> magnification

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100 

look<00:02:23.430> at<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:24.300> all<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.540> way<00:02:24.630> back<00:02:24.870> there

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
look at that it's all the way back there

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
look at that it's all the way back there
and<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.010> we're<00:02:26.100> going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> come<00:02:26.490> in<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.850> is

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and then we're going to come in this is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.060 
and then we're going to come in this is
this<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.870> sharpen<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> camera<00:02:28.920> by<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
this is not sharpen in the camera by the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.610 
this is not sharpen in the camera by the
way

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.430 

all<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.190> detail<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.640> pretty<00:02:34.910> good<00:02:35.440> well

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
all the detail is pretty good well

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.309 
all the detail is pretty good well
better<00:02:37.069> than<00:02:37.130> pretty<00:02:37.340> good<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:37.670> tremendous

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
better than pretty good it's tremendous

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.100 
better than pretty good it's tremendous
and<00:02:39.319> then<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.709> apply<00:02:39.740> your<00:02:40.130> sharpening

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and then when you apply your sharpening

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.020 
and then when you apply your sharpening
in<00:02:42.110> Photoshop<00:02:43.810> then<00:02:44.810> you'll<00:02:44.990> see<00:02:45.610> how<00:02:46.610> sharp

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
in Photoshop then you'll see how sharp

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.180 
in Photoshop then you'll see how sharp
that<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.480> we're<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.959> do<00:02:48.050> one<00:02:48.290> more<00:02:48.319> this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that is we're going to do one more this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.590 
that is we're going to do one more this
is<00:02:49.340> getting<00:02:49.700> bright<00:02:49.970> out<00:02:50.150> here<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.450> some

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
is getting bright out here for some

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.170 
is getting bright out here for some
reason<00:02:50.900> I'm<00:02:51.590> going<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.800> open<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:53.150> more

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
reason I'm going to open it up one more

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.870 
reason I'm going to open it up one more
third<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> stop<00:02:55.150> fire<00:02:56.150> off<00:02:56.360> one<00:02:56.569> more<00:02:57.880> but

little bit now we're going to go to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.850 
little bit now we're going to go to
shade<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:03.020> that's<00:04:03.230> that's<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:03.830> of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
shade and and that's that's kind of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.060 
shade and and that's that's kind of
borderline<00:04:04.280> sometime<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:04.880> too<00:04:05.030> much<00:04:05.210> and<00:04:06.070> in

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
borderline sometime it's too much and in

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.730 
borderline sometime it's too much and in
this<00:04:07.190> case<00:04:07.460> it<00:04:07.640> might<00:04:08.090> be<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:09.110> we<00:04:09.230> can<00:04:09.440> we<00:04:09.590> can

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
this case it might be but we can we can

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.990 
this case it might be but we can we can
shoot<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:10.010> now<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.490> shade<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.060> then<00:04:12.910> turn<00:04:13.910> it

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
shoot it now and shade and then turn it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.780 
shoot it now and shade and then turn it
back<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.300> bit<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.840> roll<00:04:15.830> just<00:04:16.370> dial<00:04:16.670> it

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
back a little bit and roll just dial it

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.920 
back a little bit and roll just dial it

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
back a little bit in quite as amber

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.220 
back a little bit in quite as amber
because<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.320> really<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:21.739> an<00:04:21.860> 81<00:04:22.220> EF<00:04:22.640> almost

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.790 
at that just jumps right out that's
shade<00:04:43.760> that's<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.060> best<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.650> is

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
shade that's the best one and that is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.560 
shade that's the best one and that is
again<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.550> we're<00:04:46.880> photographing<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.510> a

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
again because we're photographing in a

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.120 
again because we're photographing in a
deeply<00:04:47.990> recessed<00:04:48.500> shaded<00:04:49.130> area<00:04:49.490> on<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.860> very

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
deeply recessed shaded area on a very

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.070 
deeply recessed shaded area on a very
bright<00:04:52.340> sunny<00:04:52.580> day<00:04:52.760> so<00:04:52.820> it's<00:04:53.090> bright<00:04:53.330> blue<00:04:53.780> sky

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
bright sunny day so it's bright blue sky

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.480 
bright sunny day so it's bright blue sky
but<00:04:54.380> we're<00:04:54.500> shooting<00:04:54.740> into<00:04:54.920> a<00:04:54.950> shaded<00:04:55.370> area

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
but we're shooting into a shaded area

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.340 
but we're shooting into a shaded area
which<00:04:55.760> which<00:04:56.060> gives<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.420> a<00:04:56.450> very<00:04:56.690> blue<00:04:57.020> scene

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
which which gives you a very blue scene

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.159 
which which gives you a very blue scene
and<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:58.550> moss<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:58.970> look<00:04:59.120> bright<00:04:59.630> green<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
and I like moss to look bright green and

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.110 
and I like moss to look bright green and
that's<00:05:01.070> what<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.280> white<00:05:01.550> balance<00:05:01.970> does<00:05:02.470> so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
that's what that white balance does so

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.020 
that's what that white balance does so
we're<00:05:05.120> going<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.300> move<00:05:05.450> on<00:05:05.570> down<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.870> hill
