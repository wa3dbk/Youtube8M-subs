different terrains and surprises that we

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.099 
different terrains and surprises that we
found<00:00:16.820> we<00:00:17.820> landed<00:00:18.240> right<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.449> Eagle<00:00:18.930> crater

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
found we landed right in Eagle crater

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
found we landed right in Eagle crater
that<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.130> most<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.789> prime<00:00:21.119> mission<00:00:21.330> or

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
that was most of our prime mission or

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.870 
that was most of our prime mission or
good<00:00:22.020> fraction<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.310> drove<00:00:23.460> over

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
good fraction of it we then drove over

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.150 
good fraction of it we then drove over
to<00:00:24.029> endurance<00:00:24.810> crater<00:00:24.990> which<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> slightly

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
to endurance crater which was a slightly

to endurance crater which was a slightly
larger<00:00:26.460> crater<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.039> spent<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.820> better

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
larger crater we then spent a better

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
larger crater we then spent a better
part<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> couple<00:00:31.349> years<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.830> recall

crater<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.860> explored<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.700> was

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
crater and we explored that and that was

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.950 
crater and we explored that and that was
yet<00:00:36.360> even<00:00:36.660> larger<00:00:37.020> creator<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.450> now<00:00:39.450> we're

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
yet even larger creator and now we're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.440 
yet even larger creator and now we're
taking<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.550> real<00:00:41.879> challenge<00:00:42.329> to

taking this this this real challenge to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
taking this this this real challenge to
get<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> endeavour<00:00:42.960> crater<00:00:43.079> which<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
get to endeavour crater which is you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
get to endeavour crater which is you
know<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.700> much<00:00:44.850> further<00:00:45.090> than<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.450> ever

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
know so much further than we ever

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
know so much further than we ever
thought<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.989> rover<00:00:46.230> would<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.469> able<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> drive

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
thought the rover would be able to drive

thought the rover would be able to drive
an<00:00:47.309> endeavour<00:00:47.640> crater<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.780> large

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
an endeavour crater is a very large

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
an endeavour crater is a very large
impact<00:00:49.710> crater<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.370> much<00:00:50.789> older<00:00:51.239> than<00:00:51.449> any

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
impact crater that much older than any

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
impact crater that much older than any
of<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:51.989> we've<00:00:52.350> seen<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> still<00:00:53.699> have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
of those we've seen and so we still have

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.209 
of those we've seen and so we still have
approximately<00:00:54.660> 12<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> 14<00:00:55.379> kilometres<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.039> get

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
approximately 12 to 14 kilometres to get

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.310 
approximately 12 to 14 kilometres to get
to<00:00:56.399> endeavour

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.140 

we<00:01:01.320> were<00:01:01.440> simply<00:01:01.620> driving<00:01:02.130> along<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.820> looked

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
we were simply driving along we looked

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.120 
we were simply driving along we looked
at<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.450> images<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.990> we<00:01:04.410> had<00:01:04.500> acquired<00:01:04.800> and

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
at the images that we had acquired and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.610 
at the images that we had acquired and
we<00:01:05.489> saw<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.910> dark<00:01:06.300> spot<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.410> said

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
we saw this dark spot out and we said

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.610 
we saw this dark spot out and we said
well<00:01:07.800> wow<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.400> different<00:01:09.290> let's<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.590> there

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
well wow that's different let's go there

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.850 
well wow that's different let's go there
and<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.760> drive<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> investigated

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and so we drive to it and investigated

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.520 
and so we drive to it and investigated
amazingly<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:15.090> found<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.080> three<00:01:16.500> or

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
amazingly we found you know three or

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.290 
amazingly we found you know three or
four<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.280> meteorites<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.210> know

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
four of these meteorites you know

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.850 
four of these meteorites you know
gigantic<00:01:18.780> chunks<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> iron<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> sitting<00:01:19.770> on

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
gigantic chunks of iron to sitting on

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
gigantic chunks of iron to sitting on
the<00:01:19.950> surface<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.460> Mars<00:01:21.650> two<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.980> are

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the surface of Mars two of them are

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
the surface of Mars two of them are
almost<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.510> but<00:01:24.690> what<00:01:24.870> we<00:01:24.960> call<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
almost they have but what we call a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.320 
almost they have but what we call a
cavernous<00:01:25.830> weathering<00:01:26.370> where<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> interiors

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
cavernous weathering where the interiors

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.570 
cavernous weathering where the interiors
look<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.750> they've<00:01:27.930> been<00:01:27.960> eaten<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.710> which

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
look like they've been eaten out which

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.790 
look like they've been eaten out which
is<00:01:29.850> quite<00:01:30.210> common<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> earth<00:01:31.350> when

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
is quite common here on the earth when

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.670 
is quite common here on the earth when
you<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> water<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.240> infuses<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.229> weathers

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you have water that infuses and weathers

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.180 
you have water that infuses and weathers
out<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.190> interior<00:01:36.290> have<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.680> buried

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
out the interior have they been buried

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.930 
out the interior have they been buried
and<00:01:38.430> exhumed<00:01:39.440> was<00:01:40.440> there<00:01:40.710> liquid<00:01:41.280> water<00:01:41.550> when

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
and exhumed was there liquid water when

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.790 
and exhumed was there liquid water when
it<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.180> buried<00:01:42.630> or<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.080> there<00:01:43.290> water<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it was buried or was there water at the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.920 
it was buried or was there water at the
surface<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.729> these<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.509> kinds<00:01:45.690> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
surface and these are all the kinds of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.430 
surface and these are all the kinds of
questions<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.619> we're<00:01:46.950> asking<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
questions that we're asking then just

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.080 
questions that we're asking then just
recently<00:01:49.800> we<00:01:49.950> found<00:01:49.979> another<00:01:50.460> large<00:01:50.820> rock

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
recently we found another large rock

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
recently we found another large rock
that<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.360> completely<00:01:51.570> different<00:01:52.200> called

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that was completely different called

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
that was completely different called
Marquette<00:01:52.770> Island<00:01:53.160> we've<00:01:53.700> gotten<00:01:53.970> rid<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
Marquette Island we've gotten rid of the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760 
Marquette Island we've gotten rid of the
weathering<00:01:54.660> rind<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.110> measured<00:01:55.560> as

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
weathering rind and measured as

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.640 
weathering rind and measured as
composition<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.290> olivene<00:01:58.290> rich

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
composition and it's a very olivene rich

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.120 
composition and it's a very olivene rich
basalt<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.750> rock<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.590> has<00:02:01.770> big

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
basalt so it's a rock and it has big

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.540 
basalt so it's a rock and it has big
crystals<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.119> probably<00:02:03.390> cooled<00:02:03.960> slowly

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
crystals so it probably cooled slowly

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.050 
crystals so it probably cooled slowly
from<00:02:05.569> some<00:02:06.569> site<00:02:06.929> some<00:02:07.350> depth<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.880> was

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
from some site some depth and this was

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.850 
from some site some depth and this was
some<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:09.660> other<00:02:09.869> piece<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> Mars<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.740> had

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
some some other piece of Mars that had

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.580 
some some other piece of Mars that had
probably<00:02:11.220> gotten<00:02:11.840> blasted<00:02:12.840> off<00:02:12.990> from<00:02:13.319> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
probably gotten blasted off from a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
probably gotten blasted off from a
meteorite<00:02:13.860> strike<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.970> know<00:02:15.060> here's<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
meteorite strike so you know here's a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.540 
meteorite strike so you know here's a
whole<00:02:15.480> other<00:02:15.660> piece<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.160> planet

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
whole other piece of this the planet

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220 
whole other piece of this the planet
somewhere<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.240> analyze<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.780> try

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
somewhere that they can analyze and try

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110 
somewhere that they can analyze and try
to<00:02:19.290> figure<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.190> how<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.490> fits<00:02:20.700> into<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.090> whole

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to figure out how it fits into the whole

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.740 
to figure out how it fits into the whole
geological<00:02:21.900> picture<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.290> Mars

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.370 

I<00:02:26.060> think<00:02:27.060> everybody's<00:02:27.570> stunned<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I think everybody's stunned that the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.930 
I think everybody's stunned that the
Rovers<00:02:28.740> are<00:02:28.890> still<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.550> mean<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.820> know

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
Rovers are still going I mean you know

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.210 
Rovers are still going I mean you know
it's<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.450> been<00:02:30.690> repeated<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
it's it's been repeated if you know so

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.650 
it's it's been repeated if you know so
many<00:02:32.340> times<00:02:32.640> well<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.000> was<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> 90-day

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
many times well this was a 90-day

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.970 
many times well this was a 90-day
mission<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.140> were<00:02:34.260> six<00:02:34.500> years<00:02:34.560> into<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
mission that were six years into a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.930 
mission that were six years into a
90-day<00:02:35.460> mission<00:02:36.320> its<00:02:37.320> exploration<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.790> its

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
90-day mission its exploration and its

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.540 
90-day mission its exploration and its
truest<00:02:39.450> form<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.070> that's<00:02:41.310> what's

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
truest form you you know that's what's

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.520 
truest form you you know that's what's
so<00:02:41.700> wonderful<00:02:41.880> about<00:02:42.330> having<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.930> rover<00:02:43.380> if<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
so wonderful about having a rover if you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800 
so wonderful about having a rover if you
don't<00:02:43.740> like<00:02:43.950> where<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> are<00:02:44.490> go<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.720> go

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
don't like where you are go out and go

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.370 
don't like where you are go out and go
to<00:02:45.870> someplace<00:02:46.110> else<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
to someplace else it's just like if I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.060 
to someplace else it's just like if I
was<00:02:49.590> walking<00:02:50.130> around<00:02:50.250> somewhere<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.360> earth

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
was walking around somewhere on earth

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.350 
was walking around somewhere on earth
except<00:02:53.070> everything<00:02:53.520> tastes<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.940> little<00:02:54.090> bit

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
except everything tastes a little bit

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.390 
except everything tastes a little bit
longer<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.740> end<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.100> drive

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
longer but but at the end of the drive

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.220 
longer but but at the end of the drive
you<00:02:56.670> get<00:02:56.820> images<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.570> look<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.020> say

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you get images and you look and you say

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.350 
you get images and you look and you say
well<00:02:58.440> what's<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> same<00:02:59.489> what's<00:02:59.850> different

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
well what's the same what's different

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.540 
well what's the same what's different
what<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.930> discovered<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.709> what's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
what have we discovered and what's

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.729 
what have we discovered and what's
better<00:03:02.850> than<00:03:02.970> having<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.660> rover<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.470> do

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
better than having a rover that can do

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.400 
better than having a rover that can do
that<00:03:05.090> while<00:03:06.090> you're<00:03:06.390> here<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> comfort<00:03:07.290> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
that while you're here in the comfort of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.620 
that while you're here in the comfort of
Earth

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690
