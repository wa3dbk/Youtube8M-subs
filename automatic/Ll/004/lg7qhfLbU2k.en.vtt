00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 where one is a wind that turns this 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 lunch on lacanau rebonjour to all and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 all in one volume that is variable one 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 variable outdoor temperature at sailing 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.989
 and an outside temperature of 19 Â° 20 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 degrees a water temperature a little 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.980
 17 degrees the pond is currently in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.290
 train to finish going down the plane b 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 is at 1:10 pm with coefficients of 88 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.370
 on 7.9 going down the wind is past 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.630
 at the north-west shore of Beaufort le 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.350
 body of water is wrinkled makes them waves 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.590
 arrests 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 there are 7 or the long one with 12 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.219
 at 13 seconds from therion facing west at 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.690
 northwest northwest a swell that multiplies 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.540
 which has grown on sawmills that are 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 really long to come there are 80 of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 series that returns every 7 minutes to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.830
 about 1 1 80 on big series 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 then between sawmills 80 cm to m so 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.790
 we usually have little hands 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 gets to the edge 80 cm to 1 m ca 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 section a bit it's a bit of a spades 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.770
 but it happens to open and when there is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 the big series 1 m 20 there are big 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.299
 lines that form 200-300 meters which 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.100
 of which kibarou broad bankrupt of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.380
 catch up with the little ones seem like we 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 sees there are more favorable than the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.470
 good hump there are people in the water there are 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.510
 woods catch it's not amazing 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.280
 a restless crowd not very well oriented 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.570
 a little too long conditions that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 should be better with the fool 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 evolution for the rest of the day 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 one to the arcade buoy that is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.729
 rise with 1 m 80 and 8 seconds and so 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.470
 we wait at 13h to return 80 west to 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 west northwest 12 seconds period 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.350
 northwest wind of beaufort and there 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 17:01 m 30 to 1 meter 50 since drinking 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.159
 hiding drugs at two meters and 9 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.909
 seconds on a west to west 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.840
 northwest gently period with 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.729
 before they go back to gold 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.069
 northwest and simplified 3 to 4 beaufort 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.959
 it will be a little agitated by the wind but 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 there will be tips with high tide 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:18.640
 at the end of the day I would say trained 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.970
 on the 08 92 29 78 73 at 14h 16h and 18h 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.970
 thank you
