00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello everyone seen is not prevailing dic 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.580
 intentional actions you can find course 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.960
 practically anyone 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
 I thought I'd give you this short one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.320
 review in brief comparison between the f 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 91w above true goblet w 59 e 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.189
 practically two watches are almost 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.050
 identical what differentiates 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.689
 first the purchase price and the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 box always forced of the axis 91 is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.849
 this is the carbon here 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.550
 carbon fibers and everything is w 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.640
 59 towards the purchase I paid 13 euros 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.450
 this is 18 this takes place you are not from 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 trust I must say that the difference with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
 online it was rather produced so I have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.170
 preferred to run the economy in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.070
 italy given the period 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 and at this point I thought that I too 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.809
 change life sincerely for the few 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 euros and then press I take the store 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.289
 as you can see they are both facts 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.869
 in China it is very much in the form and 593 in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.909
 this one is 590 wc 59 but in fact 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 the only noticeable differences are 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.460
 here too we say the date here is written 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.479
 close and that is written far away for 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.120
 those with 5 then if you go in the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.080
 stopwatch 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.170
 practically in this 59 if you do 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.970
 starting if there is a function around 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.600
 written script here instead in the wc in 91 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.280
 sorry if you use the tour function writes 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.510
 the other, however, in a different position 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 as you can see other difference 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.260
 practically the last if we want is the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 that this is just water 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.240
 resistent and this instead water 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 resistent 50 meters in theory with this 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 you can swim at least according to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.590
 manual of the casio while with this 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.750
 here you can just wash my hands since 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.390
 low price purchase price 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.759
 there have been online reportage cases of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.830
 all of the extreme heads of this 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.989
 watch that has lasted very long 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.660
 well under the shower in the sea also the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.670
 glacier in the freezer 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.739
 so we say that in reality it is not a 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.080
 problem of then that we want the thing 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.860
 in the sense that it probably resists 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.519
 much more than what is declared 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.230
 this watch originates in 1991 not 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.590
 it's from the 80s as many could 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 think and became famous because 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.370
 first and foremost the most widespread in the world is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.970
 it was also used just for and it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.580
 same way for this reason come on 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.230
 from al-Qaida terrorists to like 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.490
 timer for making bombs 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.690
 the fact that they are also online photos 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.910
 bin laden with this well is also 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.730
 very precise and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.470
 and even only the primacy maybe 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.760
 might think given the low price 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 I could think of buying one 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.160
 rolex bread line with the first data instead 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.630
 no this is just for you 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.860
 arrived from this from this type of 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.470
 naked rip- offs as we say here a 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.230
 Rome what cases I thought of putting 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.940
 this function, that is, keeping the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.410
 bottom right button for five 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.790
 second writes cases or prove 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.710
 originality 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.900
 the first models of this type do not 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.040
 clearly they didn't 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.330
 this does not mean that I am not 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.280
 originals simply means that 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.230
 they were not yet imitated another thing 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.350
 which indicates originality and this 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.940
 small letter under the s 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.940
 my case is a car 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.519
 so we said that the clock has 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.950
 now an alarm lasting 20 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.900
 seconds with even the possibility of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.280
 enter the time with this rule 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.010
 and with this put so of alarm 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.319
 frattini together so rare due time 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.909
 so they both turned off as 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.129
 you have seen when using any 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.790
 function does not have to turn around 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.519
 the menu but you can resume it again 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.530
 the mode key returns then the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.100
 main screen 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.329
 displaying the time in 12 or 24 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.840
 hours 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.930
 this is the light that is a green led not 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.720
 illuminates the display evenly 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 but still sufficient in the dark in the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.949
 old models clearly was one 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.720
 bulb bulb and it wasn't real boom 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:43.050
 in short it was not a led like this here 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.360
 to report that over time the classic 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.580
 acquired becomes lucid and that the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.639
 strap does not have the so-called spring 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.110
 bar that has no springs inside but yes 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.150
 however they can replace here there is one 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.530
 arrow that you press in the direction of 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.330
 this breach comes out and therefore the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.099
 strap that is not of the highest quality 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.620
 it can be replaced when it concerns 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.750
 as for w 59 meters brother 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.039
 in quotation coupons because he has a 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.169
 design is really eighties 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.930
 by generating being born we do not say in the 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.690
 1982 and can also be seen from this 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.669
 written here lithium practically this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.220
 written testimony of its origin 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.110
 80s because in the early 80s it was one 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.919
 valuable feature to have one 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.919
 lithium battery 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.930
 their note is always from 12 or 24 hours 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:33.219
 this is always the light when the same 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.259
 same characteristics as his brother 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.499
 then we always have the twenty alarm 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.969
 seconds with the possibility of having 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.319
 alarm the opposite time signal 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:46.479
 nobody 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:48.550
 the stopwatch here it is and this is the 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.279
 time setting the calendar of 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.999
 we both say perpetual in the sense that 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:06:01.449
 do not set the year but set yes 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:03.729
 may the days the month and then let's say 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.539
 does not know leap years and I buy 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.680
 at the same time video lasts forever e 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.759
 a hundred thousand perhaps of slightly quality 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.529
 lower 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.669
 but let's say that overall how 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.349
 English watch more even if a 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.839
 a little bit smaller 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.509
 having said that these are the watches of 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.300
 entry into the casio range practically 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.389
 this one is identical to all the various a 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.589
 163 164 you see around with 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.270
 metalized 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.659
 for now it changes almost nothing 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.189
 only the 168 to a lighting of 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.219
 some speak of the humanity more 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:39.539
 as inherent instead of one's own 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.539
 a led backlight 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.750
 to say that cheaper than these is there 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.430
 only the case of the Pope that one 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.090
 analog now I don't remember the name 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.560
 or crosswise and 28 which practically 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.060
 It has virtually no buttons just buttons 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.330
 cashed to adjust the time 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.830
 the plastic back but I don't know 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.910
 that it is officially imported into 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.280
 Italy 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.880
 having said that the battery clearly to 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.880
 very long life 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.770
 I seem to have said more or less 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.080
 everything if you have curiosity or anything else 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.450
 to ask me I will try to satisfy you 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.580
 as far as I can 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.900
 let's say the historical part is that 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.570
 what really interests me most about 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.690
 therefore watch why I try to give 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.680
 these are some historical gems of economy in 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.360
 emilia 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.020
 thanks for looking at me and the 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.020
 next time
