00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 and maybe numbers from 1 to 10 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 because we do gymnastics 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.230
 for eyes we learn to manage 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.849
 if in the first case we 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.970
 concentrated then in the second case we 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.279
 do management further technology 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.400
 latent psychological impact 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.789
 we use this element 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.010
 only instead of this point we are already 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.440
 present round 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:43.660
 in humans, the asymmetry of the main cortex after 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.019
 left right hemisphere right and figurative 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.300
 left hemisphere logical right 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:57.879
 hemisphere is attached to a man's left 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.879
 eye left is true 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.269
 how will the mountains start working with you 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.610
 biological object in a more sparing 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:13.460
 mode as we looked at this 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 point we look at the center of the world in yoga 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 6 h 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 and look not at this point 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.170
 look at the club with her relaxed this 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 piercing gaze in tougher 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.689
 option we are watching with you water the class 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.830
 look in your left eye we are with you 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.530
 we activate the truth we eat and how 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.689
 It shifted used this point as 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.200
 perhaps we will begin to intensify 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.000
 one of the zones of the cerebral cortex 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.569
 perhaps this is a spatial zone 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.569
 orientation 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 but 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:00.080
 processing information in humans 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.080
 does not occur through the eyes namely 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.159
 visual area 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.159
 which are on the back of the head 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.190
 Perhaps this is a special area of dolls and maybe 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.610
 be this zone the word god this for 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.980
 motility maybe it's another their 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 depending on the task with you 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.769
 which we will set this task with you 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.290
 but the most important thing is when we are with you 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:38.730
 we begin work with biological objects 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.739
 your thoughts and your desires should not 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.790
 bear mercantile spirit and cause harm 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 another person is the most superior and it is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
 command the biblical love your neighbor as 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.629
 myself 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.420
 so here to love useful need 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.799
 start loving yourself and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.299
 project it warm fix the price 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.299
 type of energy on your environment
