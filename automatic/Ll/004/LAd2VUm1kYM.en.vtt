you<00:00:29.520> can<00:00:29.759> keep<00:00:29.910> your<00:00:30.060> panda<00:00:30.420> G<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.660> 120<00:00:31.230> range

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you can keep your panda G at 120 range

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.650 
you can keep your panda G at 120 range
you'll<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.550> able<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.940> kill<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> show<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you'll be able to kill the show and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.360 
you'll be able to kill the show and
where<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> Sherman<00:00:34.379> will<00:00:34.739> struggle<00:00:35.100> to

penetrate you the reason for this is the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
penetrate you the reason for this is the
penetration<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> 75<00:00:39.180> millimeter<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.900> the

at<00:01:00.390> maximum<00:01:00.809> range<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
at maximum range you can see it has a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
at maximum range you can see it has a
yellow<00:01:02.940> penetration<00:01:03.690> stat<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.010> means

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
yellow penetration stat on it this means

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
yellow penetration stat on it this means
it<00:01:05.460> probably<00:01:05.970> won't<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> penetrate

it probably won't be able to penetrate
and<00:01:07.760> again<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> Panzer<00:01:09.570> G<00:01:09.750> taking

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and again you see the Panzer G taking

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
and again you see the Panzer G taking
out<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> m4a3<00:01:11.159> sherman<00:01:11.780> make<00:01:12.780> note<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
out the m4a3 sherman make note that you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
out the m4a3 sherman make note that you
need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> aim<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> weak<00:01:14.520> part<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
need to aim at the weak part of the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
need to aim at the weak part of the
Sherman<00:01:15.360> which<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.990> below<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.409> turret

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Sherman which is just below the turret

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
Sherman which is just below the turret
and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> hull<00:01:17.010> where<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.700> flat<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:18.840> at

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and the hull where it's flat and also at

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
and the hull where it's flat and also at
the<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.110> bottom<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> hole<00:01:19.950> where<00:01:20.070> it's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the very bottom of the hole where it's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
the very bottom of the hole where it's
flat<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.090> 52<00:01:21.420> millimeters<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.259> armor<00:01:22.290> if

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
flat this is 52 millimeters of armor if

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.999 
flat this is 52 millimeters of armor if
you<00:01:23.220> aim<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.000> angled<00:01:24.450> parts<00:01:24.750> it

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
you aim at the angled parts it

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.170 
you aim at the angled parts it
accentuate<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> armor<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.909> do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
accentuate the armor so you don't do

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.080 
accentuate the armor so you don't do
that<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.740> maximum<00:01:28.740> range<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.280> G<00:01:29.460> stands<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that at maximum range the G stands a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
that at maximum range the G stands a
better<00:01:30.180> chance<00:01:30.330> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> aim<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.230> right

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
better chance if you aim at the right

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.249 
better chance if you aim at the right
locations

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.980 

in<00:01:39.770> an<00:01:39.890> actual<00:01:40.189> real-time<00:01:40.850> 1v1<00:01:41.570> battle

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
in an actual real-time 1v1 battle

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.389 
in an actual real-time 1v1 battle
between<00:01:42.140> these<00:01:42.380> tanks<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:42.950> actually<00:01:43.219> quite

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
between these tanks it's actually quite

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.819 
between these tanks it's actually quite
hard<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.700> stay<00:01:44.000> at<00:01:44.090> maximum<00:01:44.509> range<00:01:44.539> and<00:01:45.110> this

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
hard to stay at maximum range and this

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.620 
hard to stay at maximum range and this
is<00:01:45.979> where<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.219> Sherman<00:01:46.579> is<00:01:46.670> better<00:01:46.880> at<00:01:47.329> closer

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
is where the Sherman is better at closer

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.929 
is where the Sherman is better at closer
range<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.350> Sherman<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.280> energy<00:01:49.670> more

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
range the Sherman can take energy more

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.209 
range the Sherman can take energy more
then<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.630> G<00:01:50.810> can<00:01:50.960> take<00:01:51.140> out<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.439> Sherman<00:01:51.829> the

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
then the G can take out the Sherman the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.819 
then the G can take out the Sherman the
reason<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.030> angle<00:01:53.299> Dharma<00:01:53.829> because

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
reason is of the angle Dharma because

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.010 
reason is of the angle Dharma because
the<00:01:55.130> Panther<00:01:55.520> G<00:01:55.700> has<00:01:56.000> flat<00:01:56.299> um<00:01:56.479> all<00:01:56.659> around

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the Panther G has flat um all around

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.620 
the Panther G has flat um all around
once<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> Sherman<00:01:58.100> gets<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.610> about<00:01:58.880> 110<00:01:59.390> range

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
once the Sherman gets to about 110 range

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.419 
once the Sherman gets to about 110 range
you<00:01:59.840> can<00:02:00.049> pretty<00:02:00.560> much<00:02:00.679> successfully

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
you can pretty much successfully

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.730 
you can pretty much successfully
penetrated<00:02:01.640> most<00:02:02.390> shots<00:02:02.840> whereas<00:02:03.619> the

5 etc so this tank isn't I would say

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.500 
5 etc so this tank isn't I would say
more<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> 50/50<00:03:40.350> type<00:03:40.830> tank<00:03:41.130> where<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:42.150> want

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
to take out a bigger tank but you're

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.670 
to take out a bigger tank but you're

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.920 

so<00:03:50.680> which<00:03:50.830> tank<00:03:51.129> dawai<00:03:51.400> prefer<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.060> prefer<00:03:52.480> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
appear in closer range where the Sherman

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.199 
appear in closer range where the Sherman
