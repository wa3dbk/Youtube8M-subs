little gnarly looking on the end first
of<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.400> can<00:00:17.400> cut<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.359> end<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.690> no

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
longer gnarly looking you can see
there's<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> couple<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.910> Nick's<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.939 

reason<00:00:26.789> why<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.199> believe<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.769> only

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
reason why is because I believe the only

produce that's you know physically

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.600 
produce that's you know physically
attractive<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.070> important<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
attractive is if it's important to the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
celery and we're gonna cut it from top

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
celery and we're gonna cut it from top
to<00:01:00.960> bottom<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:03.769> I'm<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.890> split

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to bottom just like that I'm gonna split

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750 
to bottom just like that I'm gonna split
the<00:01:05.400> rib<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:07.520> then<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.640> going

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the rib all the way up then we're going

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.890 
the rib all the way up then we're going
to<00:01:08.790> flip<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> carrot

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to flip it around like we did the carrot

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.399 
to flip it around like we did the carrot
same<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> rule<00:01:10.920> same<00:01:11.400> rule<00:01:11.580> applies<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
same kind of rule same rule applies and

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.750 
same kind of rule same rule applies and
then<00:01:13.409> I'll<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.100> cut<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.610> at

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
then I'll just cut all four of these at

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.810 
then I'll just cut all four of these at
once<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.210> things<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.720> faster

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
once to make things go a little faster

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.460 
once to make things go a little faster
so<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> nice<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.320> for

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so we're gonna go with it nice I go for

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
so we're gonna go with it nice I go for
a<00:01:19.500> nice<00:01:19.619> diagonal<00:01:20.189> cut<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.360> look

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
a nice diagonal cut just to make it look

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.679 
a nice diagonal cut just to make it look
a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:21.750> bigger<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.670> depth<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a little bigger just a little depth to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.580 
a little bigger just a little depth to
our<00:01:24.720> dish<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> most<00:01:26.340> part<00:01:26.460> we'll<00:01:27.000> see

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
our dish but for the most part we'll see

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.569 
our dish but for the most part we'll see
we're<00:01:28.590> gonna<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.070> something<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
we're gonna go with something kind of

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.850 
we're gonna go with something kind of
small<00:01:30.799> reason<00:01:31.799> being<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:33.350> like<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> said<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
small reason being that like I said this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.999 
small reason being that like I said this
isn't<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.110> aromatic<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.890> gonna

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
isn't this is an aromatic this is gonna

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.289 
isn't this is an aromatic this is gonna
be<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.430> onion<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.909> isn't<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
be like your onion this isn't going to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
be like your onion this isn't going to
be<00:01:39.390> something<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:40.020> seek<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.860> in
