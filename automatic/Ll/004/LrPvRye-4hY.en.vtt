although you may run into debates about
exactly<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.520> birds<00:00:47.820> get<00:00:48.270> electrocuted<00:00:48.750> on

happening in gaming groups Bird on a
Wire<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.719> interesting<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> actually

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Wire is interesting because it actually

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.580 
Wire is interesting because it actually
comes<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.280> two<00:00:56.699> rule<00:00:57.120> sets<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.379> your

comes with two rule sets you have your

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.670 
comes with two rule sets you have your
basic<00:00:59.070> rules<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.789> advanced<00:01:00.300> rules

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
basic rules and then your advanced rules

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.130

interesting<00:01:01.680> laying<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> family<00:01:03.930> game

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
interesting laying out the family game

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990 
interesting laying out the family game
are<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> basic<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:04.920> rules<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.850> they're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
are the basic game rules I think they're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
are the basic game rules I think they're
fun<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.630> enjoyable<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.380> advanced

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
fun they're very enjoyable the advanced

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.179 
fun they're very enjoyable the advanced
game<00:01:07.979> rules<00:01:08.280> la<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.780> okay<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> scoring

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
game rules la it's okay but the scoring

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
game rules la it's okay but the scoring
doesn't<00:01:11.549> make<00:01:12.180> sense<00:01:12.540> remotely<00:01:13.350> thematically

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
doesn't make sense remotely thematically

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
doesn't make sense remotely thematically
so<00:01:14.450> while<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.780> these<00:01:16.020> games<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.770> like

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
so while I like these games and I like

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
so while I like these games and I like
the<00:01:17.280> basic<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.479> care

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the basic game and I don't really care

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.520 
the basic game and I don't really care
for<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:18.960> doesn't<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.200> matter

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
for this one doesn't really matter

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
for this one doesn't really matter
because<00:01:19.770> hey<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.850> only<00:01:20.939> need<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.390> set<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because hey you only need one set of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
because hey you only need one set of
rules<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> play<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> game<00:01:22.320> anyway<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.920> let's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you can put them on this board and draw

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.950 
you can put them on this board and draw
again<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> must<00:01:53.850> take<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.570> second

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
again but then you must take the second

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
again but then you must take the second
time<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.579> when<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> place<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> tile<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> said

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
time off when you place a tile as I said

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
time off when you place a tile as I said
before<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.079> place<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.439> anywhere<00:01:58.500> you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
you're trying to play styles that match

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.490 
you're trying to play styles that match
one<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.219> three<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:05.939> criteria<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.350> let

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
one of three different criteria so let

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.050 
one of three different criteria so let
me<00:02:07.590> put<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:07.860> tiles<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> board<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
me put some tiles here on the board and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.949 
me put some tiles here on the board and
I'll<00:02:09.270> show<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> three<00:02:09.929> different

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I'll show you the three different

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
I'll show you the three different
criteria<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> game<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> trying<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.239> get

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
criteria that the game is trying to get

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.330 
criteria that the game is trying to get
and<00:02:13.620> we're<00:02:13.710> gonna<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.890> looking<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and we're gonna be looking at the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.540 
and we're gonna be looking at the
columns<00:02:14.760> here<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:16.290> first<00:02:16.530> column<00:02:16.800> here

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
columns here in the first column here

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.020 
columns here in the first column here
you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.940> see<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.380> three<00:02:19.950> birds<00:02:20.370> all

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you can see that I have three birds all

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.090 
you can see that I have three birds all
of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> same<00:02:21.720> color<00:02:21.990> but<00:02:22.680> three<00:02:22.980> different

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
shapes that's fine they have one common

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.290 
shapes that's fine they have one common
characteristic<00:02:25.730> birds<00:02:26.730> are<00:02:26.880> either<00:02:26.970> blue

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300

third here I have all three different

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.910 
third here I have all three different

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.860 
colors but two of them are the same
shape<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.730> none<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.090> rows<00:03:09.270> would<00:03:09.510> score

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
shape so none of the rows would score

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.020 
shape so none of the rows would score
but<00:03:10.440> here<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.920> score<00:03:11.160> nine<00:03:11.400> points<00:03:11.880> three

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
but here I would score nine points three

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.390 
but here I would score nine points three
for<00:03:12.450> each<00:03:12.510> column<00:03:13.050> because<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.830> the

for each column because I have the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
for each column because I have the
scoring<00:03:14.850> correctly<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> game

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
scoring correctly now as the game

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.770 
scoring correctly now as the game
progresses<00:03:17.040> more<00:03:17.970> birds<00:03:18.209> will<00:03:18.390> be<00:03:18.480> placed

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
progresses more birds will be placed

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.009 
progresses more birds will be placed
here<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.140> middle<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:20.070> when<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.519> whole<00:03:21.330> row

birds will be able to stand on one leg

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.920 
birds will be able to stand on one leg
he<00:03:52.170> won't<00:03:52.410> fly<00:03:52.590> away<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.760> fact<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.900> end

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
he won't fly away and in fact at the end

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.569 
he won't fly away and in fact at the end
of<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.170> game<00:03:55.350> if<00:03:55.590> he's<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.040> scoring<00:03:56.340> row

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
of the game if he's in a scoring row

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.199 
of the game if he's in a scoring row
he'll<00:03:57.000> score<00:03:57.329> an<00:03:57.570> additional<00:03:58.470> point<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.250> so

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
he'll score an additional point and so

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.390 
he'll score an additional point and so
once<00:04:00.540> one<00:04:00.720> players<00:04:00.959> board<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> filled<00:04:01.739> the

once one players board is filled the
game<00:04:02.610> ends<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.180> everyone<00:04:03.959> counts<00:04:04.200> at<00:04:04.290> their

game ends and everyone counts at their

game ends and everyone counts at their
points<00:04:04.680> whereas<00:04:04.920> most<00:04:05.190> points<00:04:05.549> wins<00:04:05.900> the

points whereas most points wins the
events<00:04:07.290> scoring<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.860> very<00:04:08.100> similar<00:04:09.140> in<00:04:10.140> how

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
events scoring is very similar in how

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.259 
events scoring is very similar in how
the<00:04:10.769> game<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.220> played<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the game is played it's just that the

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.050 
the game is played it's just that the
scoring<00:04:12.750> is<00:04:12.900> differently<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:14.070> I'm<00:04:14.790> not<00:04:14.940> going

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
scoring is differently and I'm not going

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.430 
scoring is differently and I'm not going
to<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.239> into<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> exact<00:04:15.870> rules<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.320> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to get into the exact rules of the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.280 
to get into the exact rules of the
advanced<00:04:17.070> game<00:04:17.310> but<00:04:18.000> let<00:04:18.120> me<00:04:18.239> show<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.510> how

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
advanced game but let me show you how

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.210 
advanced game but let me show you how
scoring<00:04:19.739> works

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
scoring works

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.580 
scoring works
just<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> show<00:04:21.359> why<00:04:21.570> I'm<00:04:21.630> not<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.840> huge<00:04:22.260> fan<00:04:22.289> of

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
just to show why I'm not a huge fan of

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.640 
just to show why I'm not a huge fan of
it<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:23.789> can<00:04:23.820> see<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.539> scoring<00:04:25.140> board<00:04:25.470> at

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
it here we can see the scoring board at

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.140 
it here we can see the scoring board at
the<00:04:25.800> end

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the end

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.659 
the end
we're<00:04:27.270> looking<00:04:27.540> for<00:04:27.750> groups<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.410> birds<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.370> the

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
we're looking for groups of birds of the

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.400 
we're looking for groups of birds of the
same<00:04:30.030> kinda<00:04:30.540> colors<00:04:30.870> here's<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.169> group<00:04:31.260> of

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
same kinda colors here's a group of

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.129 
same kinda colors here's a group of
three<00:04:31.680> here's<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.699> group<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:33.000> two<00:04:33.210> here's<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
three here's a group of two here's a

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.990 
three here's a group of two here's a
group<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.440> two<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.460> rest<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:35.699> these<00:04:35.820> are

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
group of two and the rest of these are

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.870 
group of two and the rest of these are
singles<00:04:36.449> singles<00:04:36.630> don't<00:04:36.930> count<00:04:37.229> for<00:04:37.410> scoring

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
singles singles don't count for scoring

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.990 
singles singles don't count for scoring
so<00:04:38.880> my<00:04:39.270> smallest<00:04:39.750> grouping<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.560> two<00:04:41.000> so

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
so my smallest grouping is two so

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.610 
so my smallest grouping is two so
therefore<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.419> get<00:04:42.510> two<00:04:42.780> points<00:04:43.110> for<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.350> and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
therefore I get two points for this and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.340 
therefore I get two points for this and
two<00:04:43.860> points<00:04:44.250> for<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:45.630> four<00:04:45.840> points<00:04:46.169> total

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
two points for this so four points total

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.070 
two points for this so four points total
and<00:04:46.620> again<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.520> bird<00:04:47.669> is<00:04:47.880> on<00:04:48.000> one<00:04:48.210> leg<00:04:48.419> you

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
and again if a bird is on one leg you

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.240 
and again if a bird is on one leg you
get<00:04:49.229> an<00:04:49.320> extra<00:04:49.560> point

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
get an extra point

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.870 
get an extra point
if<00:04:50.910> however<00:04:51.150> let's<00:04:51.630> say<00:04:51.750> for<00:04:52.020> some<00:04:52.260> odd<00:04:52.500> reason

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
if however let's say for some odd reason

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.189 
if however let's say for some odd reason
none<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:53.970> these<00:04:54.060> birds<00:04:54.419> have<00:04:54.630> been<00:04:54.750> next<00:04:55.050> to

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
none of these birds have been next to

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.400 
none of these birds have been next to
each<00:04:55.320> other<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.479> this<00:04:57.479> was<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:57.750> only<00:04:57.960> scoring

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
each other and this was my only scoring

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.469 
each other and this was my only scoring
group<00:04:58.530> then<00:04:59.310> my<00:04:59.520> small<00:04:59.789> scoring<00:05:00.150> group<00:05:00.240> would

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
group then my small scoring group would

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.450 
group then my small scoring group would
be<00:05:00.510> three<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.229> would<00:05:01.350> get<00:05:01.500> three<00:05:01.770> points<00:05:02.250> if

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
be three and I would get three points if

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.189 
be three and I would get three points if
you<00:05:02.880> manage<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.150> have<00:05:03.270> two<00:05:03.479> groups<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:03.900> were

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
you manage to have two groups that were

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.110 
you manage to have two groups that were
two<00:05:04.800> groups<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.190> three<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.580> would<00:05:05.669> get<00:05:05.880> three

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
two groups of three you would get three

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.150 
two groups of three you would get three
points<00:05:06.449> for<00:05:06.630> each<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.930> six<00:05:07.500> points<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.130> on

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
points for each and six points and so on

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.129 
points for each and six points and so on
and<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.520> forth<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.330> obviously<00:05:09.810> getting<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
and so forth so obviously getting a

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.689 
and so forth so obviously getting a
large<00:05:10.410> group<00:05:10.710> together<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.100> net<00:05:11.280> being<00:05:11.520> here

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
large group together a net being here

this<00:05:20.100> is<00:05:20.280> convoluted<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.090> makes<00:05:21.270> sense

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
this is convoluted and it makes sense

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.930 
this is convoluted and it makes sense
from<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.870> scoring<00:05:22.289> perspective<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.190> guess<00:05:23.490> but

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
from a scoring perspective I guess but

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.100 
from a scoring perspective I guess but
it<00:05:24.030> doesn't<00:05:24.270> make<00:05:24.360> any<00:05:24.479> sense<00:05:24.750> though

have<00:05:29.310> absolutely<00:05:29.789> no<00:05:30.120> clue<00:05:30.449> on<00:05:30.870> how<00:05:31.169> all<00:05:31.680> that

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
have absolutely no clue on how all that

have absolutely no clue on how all that
works<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.550> fits<00:05:32.760> together<00:05:32.940> so<00:05:33.479> I<00:05:33.690> don't

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
works and fits together so I don't

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.110 
works and fits together so I don't
really<00:05:34.590> want<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.340> play<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.669> advanced<00:05:35.910> game

have a good time
scoring<00:05:54.360> it's<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.510> little<00:05:54.860> interesting

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
scoring it's a little interesting

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.890

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
there but there's two they have to be

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.219 
there but there's two they have to be
three<00:06:02.550> different<00:06:02.820> sizes<00:06:03.000> kids<00:06:03.810> have<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.080> learn

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
three different sizes kids have to learn

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.230 
three different sizes kids have to learn
to<00:06:04.380> three<00:06:04.590> different<00:06:04.740> scoring<00:06:05.190> patterns<00:06:05.789> but

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
to three different scoring patterns but

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.339 
to three different scoring patterns but
once<00:06:06.419> you<00:06:06.539> get<00:06:06.630> them<00:06:06.750> down<00:06:06.900> they're<00:06:07.139> pretty

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
once you get them down they're pretty

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.439 
once you get them down they're pretty
simple<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.310> advanced<00:06:08.520> game<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:08.820> just<00:06:09.180> really

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
simple the advanced game I just really

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.570 
simple the advanced game I just really
don't<00:06:09.570> get<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:09.870> much<00:06:10.289> I'm<00:06:10.680> sure<00:06:11.039> that<00:06:11.280> once<00:06:11.460> I

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
don't get that much I'm sure that once I

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.129 
don't get that much I'm sure that once I
post<00:06:11.849> this<00:06:12.030> I'll<00:06:12.180> get<00:06:12.330> comments<00:06:12.570> from<00:06:12.810> folks

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
post this I'll get comments from folks

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.290 
post this I'll get comments from folks
saying<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:14.130> can't<00:06:14.520> believe<00:06:14.639> that<00:06:14.970> that's<00:06:15.120> the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
saying I can't believe that that's the

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.379 
saying I can't believe that that's the
much<00:06:15.539> more<00:06:15.810> strategic<00:06:16.289> game<00:06:16.500> maybe<00:06:17.099> so<00:06:17.520> but<00:06:17.820> I

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
much more strategic game maybe so but I

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.010 
much more strategic game maybe so but I
have<00:06:18.930> to<00:06:19.110> have<00:06:19.260> a<00:06:19.289> game<00:06:19.650> where<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.690> rules<00:06:21.690> at

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
have to have a game where the rules at

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.650 
have to have a game where the rules at
least<00:06:22.070> kind<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.280> make<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.760> Matic<00:06:24.090> sense<00:06:24.389> and

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
least kind of make the Matic sense and

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.870 
least kind of make the Matic sense and
here<00:06:25.229> they<00:06:25.380> don't<00:06:25.590> and<00:06:25.860> for<00:06:26.039> me<00:06:26.160> in<00:06:26.400> this<00:06:26.639> game

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
here they don't and for me in this game

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.879 
here they don't and for me in this game
that's<00:06:27.300> such<00:06:27.599> a<00:06:27.630> disconnect<00:06:28.139> I<00:06:28.470> just<00:06:28.740> don't

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
that's such a disconnect I just don't

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.830 
that's such a disconnect I just don't
want<00:06:29.070> to<00:06:29.099> play<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.400> advanced<00:06:29.669> game<00:06:29.940> but<00:06:30.570> I

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
want to play the advanced game but I

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.510 
want to play the advanced game but I
won't<00:06:31.229> let<00:06:31.349> that<00:06:31.440> distract<00:06:31.830> you<00:06:32.070> from<00:06:32.250> whether

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
won't let that distract you from whether

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.770 
won't let that distract you from whether
you<00:06:32.639> want<00:06:32.789> to<00:06:32.849> get<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.060> game<00:06:33.240> or<00:06:33.389> not<00:06:33.419> because

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
you want to get the game or not because

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.510 
you want to get the game or not because
you<00:06:33.810> don't<00:06:33.990> need<00:06:34.320> two<00:06:34.590> sets<00:06:34.889> of<00:06:35.039> rules<00:06:35.250> you<00:06:35.430> can

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
you don't need two sets of rules you can

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.310 
you don't need two sets of rules you can
play<00:06:35.640> with<00:06:35.789> the<00:06:35.880> basic<00:06:36.270> rules<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:36.719> I<00:06:37.110> thought

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
play with the basic rules and I thought

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.290 
play with the basic rules and I thought
those<00:06:37.530> are<00:06:37.560> pretty<00:06:37.860> fun<00:06:38.099> it's<00:06:38.820> a<00:06:38.940> decent

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
those are pretty fun it's a decent

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.820 
those are pretty fun it's a decent
addition<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.960> the<00:06:40.110> series

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
addition to the series

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.650 
addition to the series
not<00:06:41.250> one<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.430> the<00:06:41.580> best<00:06:41.790> games<00:06:42.090> of<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.330> series

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
not one of the best games of the series

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.180 
not one of the best games of the series
but<00:06:42.780> a<00:06:42.840> fun<00:06:43.110> one<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.350> one<00:06:43.860> of<00:06:43.950> the<00:06:44.010> more

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
but a fun one and one of the more

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.620
