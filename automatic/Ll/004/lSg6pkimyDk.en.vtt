 for the stage of today 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.129
 that to whom all two and a half minutes and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 from departures I had thought that it 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.100
 could recover it could do something 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.280
 to stop to win stage e 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 even winning the general will come to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.410
 be ahead the general and then today 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 thank the Lord it has been a great day and 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 we have achieved victory and by 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 moment leading the good classification 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.640
 we were very aware of the stage and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 at the beginning there were some true courts 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 but they reached us already when the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.380
 the final summit 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.920
 if it was well played with 9 minutes then 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:20.490
 he put the bit to throw and the garmin and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.159
 we have reached missing 15 km and then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.039
 the last rise and 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.950
 and it was my colleague fortunato baliani who 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.399
 has given me a hand and in the end has 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.909
 Attacked one of the Navarre green it 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:41.170
 there and then against attacking and back 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.179
 and thanks to the Lord we have achieved that 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.130
 well come julián good, tell us 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.729
 a little how you feel with the team 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.890
 Japan pink and how Julian got there 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.579
 not so happened and four years in 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.729
 visitor italy after them I 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.310
 they contacted and gave me the opportunity 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.039
 last year and had the whole year 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.299
 I was with him profitably I had 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:10.119
 visa problems and can not almost be 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.049
 on a European calendar and this year I 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.150
 confirmed a topic and paying them the 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.970
 confidence that they have given me is julián 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.310
 what rivals in the race of those who are 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 to be aware of what's left of 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.610
 good career I think that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.989
 anyway, although we have a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.530
 minute and a half of advantage over the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.709
 second always a man is a lot 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.379
 It has a long history and you can not 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.319
 give a meter you have to be aware and 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.500
 attentive mind can be for example 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.040
 tomorrow that is a day of 220 kilometers 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.620
 then work with the team and try 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.599
 of not sending leaks 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.239
 great also to be very happy 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.819
 because víctor child entered third true 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.829
 there of transit very good and because 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.260
 also sides to Venezuelans after 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.549
 well that he has spoken with víctor that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.540
 reached the end of the stage that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.569
 They said not us from the start 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.849
 help matters buy life 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.030
 we have been in contact since we have 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.180
 found and what víctor is a great 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.020
 person and therefore very happy because 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.090
 both me and him did well 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.340
 We hope to finish in the best way and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.830
 succeed how good that another stage of 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.780
 high complexity so you see how 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.380
 some criticism wants that is left for 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.600
 defend the shirt thoroughly I do not think 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.870
 that the morning and four awards of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.870
 Montana 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.110
 of fourth category and one of third 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.560
 I think and these are the stage is very long 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.480
 of tomorrow are 220 kilometers of rest 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.220
 they are stages I think for sprinters there are 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.370
 a lot of sprinters who have not won 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.680
 so 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.409
 although they are interested I find 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.170
 in controlling the race a bit so that 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.840
 we arrive in a group 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.510
 and we will look to see what happens 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.180
 after this julián race you come 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.980

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.410

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.750

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.810

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.300

 I said I was in Colombia running to 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.180
 end of season because you can not 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.760

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.830
