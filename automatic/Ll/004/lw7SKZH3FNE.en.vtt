referring to two types of information

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640 
referring to two types of information
the<00:00:17.820> first<00:00:18.060> type<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> poker<00:00:18.990> tell<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.470> we

the first type is a poker tell which we
define<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> behavior<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.510> correlated

define as a behavior that is correlated

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.439 
define as a behavior that is correlated
with<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> specific<00:00:22.529> piece<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.340> information<00:00:23.609> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
happen so quickly so you need to be

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.470 
happen so quickly so you need to be
paying<00:02:44.040> attention<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.880> person<00:02:45.300> at

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the right time and make sure you're

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.860 
the right time and make sure you're
focusing<00:02:47.610> on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.940> right<00:02:48.120> part<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> face

hands is way more predictable and

can slightly gesture or move forward and
then<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.380> start<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> pay<00:02:58.860> attention<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
then you can start to pay attention to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000 
then you can start to pay attention to
that<00:02:59.550> individual<00:03:00.150> fifth<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.110> people<00:03:01.560> are<00:03:01.709> so

that individual fifth is people are so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.309 
that individual fifth is people are so
terrible<00:03:02.580> at<00:03:02.730> standardizing<00:03:03.540> behavior<00:03:04.080> that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.050 
because it is part of the body that is
required<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.289> much<00:05:08.530> at<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.919> table<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.430> even

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
required so much at the table and even

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.640 
required so much at the table and even
though<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.210> can<00:05:10.419> standardize<00:05:10.990> your<00:05:11.199> movement

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
though you can standardize your movement

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.469 
though you can standardize your movement
so<00:05:11.949> many<00:05:12.190> players<00:05:12.520> will<00:05:12.729> have<00:05:12.819> a<00:05:12.880> difficult

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
so many players will have a difficult

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.080 
so many players will have a difficult
time<00:05:13.690> actually<00:05:14.289> implementing<00:05:14.919> that<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:16.060> I

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
time actually implementing that so I

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
time actually implementing that so I
know<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.389> is<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.509> little<00:05:16.690> bit<00:05:16.900> theoretical

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
know this is a little bit theoretical

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.809 
know this is a little bit theoretical
but<00:05:17.680> if<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.860> want<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.130> make<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.580> more

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
but if you want to make this more

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.399 
but if you want to make this more
practical<00:05:19.389> actually<00:05:19.750> see<00:05:19.990> me<00:05:20.139> break<00:05:20.380> down

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
practical actually see me break down

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.589 
practical actually see me break down
