how the three ultras are supposed to
look<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:24.160> three<00:02:24.670> options<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.120> easier<00:02:26.019> version

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
look the three options is easier version

I'll show a and steadily three or you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.680 
I'll show a and steadily three or you
can<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.670> regular<00:02:39.940> three<00:02:40.180> way<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.540> one<00:02:40.660> I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
can do the regular three way the one I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.589 
can do the regular three way the one I
do<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.349> a<00:02:41.470> lot<00:02:41.560> easier<00:02:41.769> is<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.060> where<00:02:43.330> at

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
do it's a lot easier is the one where at

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.520 
do it's a lot easier is the one where at
the<00:02:43.780> top<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:45.030> ultra<00:02:46.030> when<00:02:46.750> she<00:02:46.930> does<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> epic

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the top of ultra when she does the epic

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.330 
the top of ultra when she does the epic
add<00:02:47.709> at<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.940> last<00:02:49.390> part<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.799> five<00:02:51.099> hits

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
add at the last part of the five hits

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.670 
add at the last part of the five hits
because<00:02:52.180> every<00:02:52.390> shadow<00:02:52.569> hits<00:02:52.780> five<00:02:52.989> times<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
because every shadow hits five times so

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.620 
because every shadow hits five times so
at<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.430> last<00:02:54.640> part<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> uppercut<00:02:55.480> right

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
at the last part of the uppercut right

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.660 
at the last part of the uppercut right
before<00:02:56.079> she<00:02:56.200> grabs<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.620> character<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.430> call

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
before she grabs the character you call

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.420 
before she grabs the character you call
the<00:02:57.819> ultra<00:02:58.569> ender<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.530> it'll<00:02:59.799> cause<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.069> wall

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
the ultra ender and it'll cause the wall

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.979 
the ultra ender and it'll cause the wall
splat<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:00.819> you'll<00:03:01.090> be<00:03:01.209> able<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.480> go<00:03:01.599> into<00:03:01.810> your

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
splat and you'll be able to go into your

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.410 
splat and you'll be able to go into your
shadow<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.670> definitely<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.090> easier

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
shadow now this is definitely the easier

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.479 
shadow now this is definitely the easier
version<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.959> how<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.140> do<00:03:05.379> it<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.190> definitely

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
version of how to do it so I definitely

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.759 
version of how to do it so I definitely
recommend<00:03:06.700> doing<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.599> one<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.319> start<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> out

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
recommend doing this one to start it out

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.740 
recommend doing this one to start it out
you<00:03:09.190> know<00:03:09.280> give<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.730> use<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> timing<00:03:10.480> and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
you know give the use of the timing and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.509 
you know give the use of the timing and
then<00:03:11.260> eventually<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:11.860> practice<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
then eventually you just practice the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.170 
then eventually you just practice the
six<00:03:13.030> social<00:03:13.329> life<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.190> that's<00:03:15.400> that's<00:03:15.639> one<00:03:15.970> way

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
six social life so that's that's one way

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.360 
six social life so that's that's one way
to<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.630> now<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:17.560> going<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.769> show<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
to do it now I'm going to show you the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.050 
to do it now I'm going to show you the
can<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.060> forth

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
can so forth

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.849 
can so forth
okay<00:03:22.060> guys<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.750> how<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:22.989> cancel<00:03:23.739> into

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
okay guys here is how you cancel into

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.370 
okay guys here is how you cancel into
the<00:03:24.130> three<00:03:24.670> ultravision<00:03:25.079> see<00:03:26.079> what<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.260> going

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
the three ultravision see what I'm going

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.539 
the three ultravision see what I'm going
to<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.500> here<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.769> I'm<00:03:26.859> going<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.069> shape<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
to do here is I'm going to shape the

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.789 
to do here is I'm going to shape the
instinct<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.079> then<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.290> let<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.560> play<00:03:29.709> through

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
instinct and then I let it play through

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.819 
instinct and then I let it play through
and<00:03:30.760> when<00:03:31.000> she<00:03:31.180> goes<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.780> uppercut<00:03:32.500> part

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and when she goes to the uppercut part

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.280 
and when she goes to the uppercut part
he's<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.579> hit<00:03:33.700> five<00:03:33.880> times<00:03:34.180> one<00:03:35.139> two

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
he's going to hit five times one two

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.559 
he's going to hit five times one two
three<00:03:35.470> four<00:03:35.680> five<00:03:35.889> on<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.430> six<00:03:36.700> Q<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.239> when<00:03:37.480> you

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
three four five on the six Q is when you

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.050 
three four five on the six Q is when you
want<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> hit<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.989> alt<00:03:38.170> render<00:03:38.849> so<00:03:39.849> I'm<00:03:39.970> gonna

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
want to hit the alt render so I'm gonna

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.550 
want to hit the alt render so I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.630> now

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
demonstrate that now

down with the wall spot and you should

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.940 
down with the wall spot and you should
be<00:03:49.620> able<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.860> shut<00:03:50.070> up

cultures ensuring why exactly these six
ultras<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.510> somewhat<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.230> glitch<00:04:19.440> and

ultras is in somewhat of a glitch and

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.280 
ultras is in somewhat of a glitch and
why<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.310> three<00:04:20.489> options<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.299> because<00:04:22.109> the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
why the three options is it because the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.430 
why the three options is it because the
ultras<00:04:23.030> causes<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.060> wall<00:04:24.300> splat<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.260> also

engines and a combo people until they
fall<00:04:32.550> out<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:32.970> there's<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.570> quick<00:04:33.720> example

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
fall out so there's a quick example

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.409 
fall out so there's a quick example
there's<00:04:34.470> one<00:04:34.560> under<00:04:34.980> two<00:04:35.640> vendors<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.240> they

there's one under two vendors and they
fall<00:04:36.630> out<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.590> you're<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:38.040> even<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.460> it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
fall out so you're not even do it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.300 
fall out so you're not even do it
anymore<00:04:38.760> that's<00:04:39.750> why<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.500> entire<00:04:40.860> state<00:04:41.130> sort

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
anymore that's why the entire state sort

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.820 
anymore that's why the entire state sort
risk<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.669> equal<00:04:41.910> inch<00:04:45.169> okay<00:04:46.169> so<00:04:46.230> guys<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.800> hope
