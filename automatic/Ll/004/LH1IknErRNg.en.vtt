00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
for that and it sounds very simple but

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.029 
for that and it sounds very simple but
for<00:01:37.249> the<00:01:37.369> next<00:01:37.549> eight<00:01:37.849> hours<00:01:38.359> I<00:01:38.709> basically<00:01:39.709> am

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
for the next eight hours I basically am

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.749 
for the next eight hours I basically am
taking<00:01:40.549> care<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:40.789> those<00:01:41.060> patients

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
discharging and then moving and the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.300 
discharging and then moving and the
whole<00:01:46.099> idea<00:01:46.279> of<00:01:46.520> ER<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.119> patient<00:01:47.719> flow<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:49.189> you

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
whole idea of ER is patient flow so you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.879 
whole idea of ER is patient flow so you
move<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.299> patients<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.109> get<00:01:51.319> them<00:01:51.499> in<00:01:51.679> you

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
move the patients you get them in you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.550 
move the patients you get them in you

down on that
our<00:02:12.230> journey<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.980> very<00:02:13.190> long<00:02:14.290> discharging

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
our journey for very long discharging

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.680 
our journey for very long discharging
them<00:02:15.470> as<00:02:15.890> soon<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.370> possible<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.209> they<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:17.510> get

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
them as soon as possible so they can get

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.720 
them as soon as possible so they can get
out<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.200> get<00:02:18.350> moving<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.010> next<00:02:19.310> patient

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
out and get moving and the next patient

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.449 
out and get moving and the next patient
can<00:02:19.880> come<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.380> basically<00:02:21.680> you're<00:02:22.160> doing
