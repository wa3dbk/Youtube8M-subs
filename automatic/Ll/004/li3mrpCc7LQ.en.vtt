backpack<00:02:09.660> um<00:02:10.459> no<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.849> really

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.440 
backpack um no not really
they<00:02:13.349> don't<00:02:13.590> fit<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.190> very<00:02:14.430> well<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.090> they

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
they don't fit in very well and they

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.050 
they don't fit in very well and they
will<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:16.110> stay<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:16.920> I've<00:02:17.190> tried<00:02:17.700> numerous

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
will not stay there I've tried numerous

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.360 
will not stay there I've tried numerous
times<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.409> just<00:02:19.620> doesn't<00:02:20.010> work

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
times and it just doesn't work

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
times and it just doesn't work
also<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.420> are<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:22.170> this

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
also there are on this

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.800 
also there are on this
little<00:02:23.680> butt-flap<00:02:24.160> there<00:02:24.910> are<00:02:25.090> crevices<00:02:25.780> for

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
little butt-flap there are crevices for

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.800 
little butt-flap there are crevices for
the<00:02:26.410> guns<00:02:26.770> in<00:02:27.100> vehicle<00:02:27.760> mode<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.510> would<00:02:28.600> think

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the guns in vehicle mode you would think

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.450 
the guns in vehicle mode you would think
that<00:02:28.870> maybe<00:02:29.410> there's<00:02:29.680> enough<00:02:29.890> clearance<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
that maybe there's enough clearance to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.030 
that maybe there's enough clearance to
store<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> swords<00:02:31.030> there<00:02:31.180> nope<00:02:31.660> not<00:02:31.930> really

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
store the swords there nope not really

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.290 
store the swords there nope not really
this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.340> best<00:02:33.520> I've<00:02:33.700> been<00:02:33.730> able<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.090> do

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
this is the best I've been able to do

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.020 
this is the best I've been able to do
but<00:02:34.600> then<00:02:34.780> again<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.200> am<00:02:35.410> terrible<00:02:36.100> at<00:02:36.250> toys<00:02:36.490> so

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
but then again I am terrible at toys so

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.990 
but then again I am terrible at toys so
there's<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.530> keep<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.070> mind<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.580> look

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
there's that to keep in mind and look

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.050 
there's that to keep in mind and look
look<00:02:40.390> at<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.630> light-piping<00:02:41.400> Wow<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.730> good

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
look at that light-piping Wow is it good

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.330 
look at that light-piping Wow is it good
as<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.510> said<00:02:43.720> her<00:02:43.870> transformation<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> bit<00:02:45.190> of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
as I said her transformation is a bit of

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.130 
as I said her transformation is a bit of
a<00:02:45.430> show<00:02:45.670> former<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.390> let's<00:02:46.660> go<00:02:46.780> ahead<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.990> get

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
a show former so let's go ahead and get

00:02:47.140 --> 00:03:21.120 
a show former so let's go ahead and get
into<00:02:47.380> it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.700 

the<00:03:22.130> old<00:03:22.760> mode<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.300> she<00:03:23.510> has<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:24.080> always<00:03:24.530> been

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
the old mode that she has is always been

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.830 
the old mode that she has is always been
a<00:03:24.740> little<00:03:24.890> bit<00:03:25.100> weird<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.520> me<00:03:25.820> but<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.780> is

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
a little bit weird to me but it is

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.710 
a little bit weird to me but it is
supposed<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.980> futuristic<00:03:28.850> Cybertronian

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
supposed to be a futuristic Cybertronian

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.770 
supposed to be a futuristic Cybertronian
car<00:03:30.080> so<00:03:30.890> we've<00:03:31.430> succeeded<00:03:32.030> here

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
car so we've succeeded here

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.600 
car so we've succeeded here
I<00:03:32.810> think<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.350> designers<00:03:33.800> should<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.430> pat

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
I think the designers should really pat

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.850 
I think the designers should really pat
themselves<00:03:34.850> on<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.270> back<00:03:35.390> now<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.440> think<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
themselves on the back now I think the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.620 
themselves on the back now I think the
Takara<00:03:37.370> version<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.120> figure<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.600> probably

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
Takara version of the figure is probably

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.230 
Takara version of the figure is probably
painted<00:03:39.470> better<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.340> what<00:03:40.490> we<00:03:40.610> have<00:03:40.790> here<00:03:41.060> is

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
painted better but what we have here is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.330 
painted better but what we have here is
perfectly<00:03:41.870> serviceable<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.770> is<00:03:43.130> actually

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
perfectly serviceable and is actually

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.660 
perfectly serviceable and is actually
quite<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.270> fun<00:03:44.570> little<00:03:44.960> car<00:03:45.320> mode<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.460> had<00:03:46.640> a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
quite a fun little car mode if I had a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.940 
quite a fun little car mode if I had a
figure<00:03:47.000> small<00:03:47.270> enough<00:03:47.540> they<00:03:47.870> could<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:48.170> they

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
figure small enough they could be they

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.820 
figure small enough they could be they
could<00:03:48.980> easily<00:03:49.370> fit<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.210> those<00:03:50.420> seats<00:03:50.830> it's

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
could easily fit in those seats it's

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.880 
could easily fit in those seats it's
just<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.540> beautiful<00:03:53.540> little<00:03:53.990> old<00:03:54.200> mode<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
just a beautiful little old mode the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.110 
just a beautiful little old mode the
wheels<00:03:55.100> however<00:03:55.370> are<00:03:56.410> really<00:03:57.410> really<00:03:58.340> tiny<00:03:58.610> I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
wheels however are really really tiny I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.080 
wheels however are really really tiny I
mean<00:03:59.660> they<00:03:59.810> are<00:03:59.990> super<00:04:00.890> tiny<00:04:01.100> super<00:04:01.640> thin<00:04:01.880> and

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
mean they are super tiny super thin and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.810 
mean they are super tiny super thin and
super<00:04:02.720> flimsy<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.440> be<00:04:04.070> aware<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.490> if<00:04:04.730> you

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
super flimsy so be aware of that if you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.300 
super flimsy so be aware of that if you
pick<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:05.120> figure<00:04:05.420> up<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:06.530> can<00:04:06.740> also<00:04:07.010> mount

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
pick this figure up you can also mount

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.220 
pick this figure up you can also mount
the<00:04:07.520> weapons<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.090> vehicle<00:04:08.600> mode<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.990> I<00:04:09.020> think

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the weapons in vehicle mode and I think

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.020 
the weapons in vehicle mode and I think
the<00:04:09.320> weapons<00:04:09.650> work<00:04:09.950> well<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.700> have<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
the weapons work well you have the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.210 
the weapons work well you have the
swords<00:04:11.600> on<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.840> side<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> guns<00:04:12.770> on<00:04:13.070> the

swords on the side and the guns on the
back<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.700> pick<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.270> vehicle<00:04:14.600> mode<00:04:14.750> or

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
back of the pick of the vehicle mode or

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.780 
back of the pick of the vehicle mode or
you<00:04:15.380> could<00:04:15.560> switch<00:04:15.770> it<00:04:15.800> up<00:04:15.980> with<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.340> guns<00:04:16.549> on

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
you could switch it up with the guns on

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.220 
you could switch it up with the guns on
the<00:04:16.910> side<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.510> swords<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.080> back

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
there's just not enough ground clearance
