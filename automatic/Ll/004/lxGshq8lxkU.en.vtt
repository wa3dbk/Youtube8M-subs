00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hi, people here are pam and I'm here. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.600
 to tell you what I want 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.519
 August reading also begins some 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.030
 projects where I have not been much used in this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.160
 month 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 It's how I want to work other things. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.299
 it a lot last month 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.949
 I intend to get a little lighter. 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.050
 this month because there is a lot to come 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.340
 and I do not know if I'll handle it then 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 I selected some streets with lots of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 salsa is also bernal and others that the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 promised in the other months and will not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.369
 so I'm going to tell you everything now 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 read to recapture two readings that I 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 had promised for the month of June and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.770
 I did not realize and what I need to do 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 now 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
 one of them is the fireproof of them of this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 how the film will be released soon and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.770
 I really want to read before my movie. 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.360
 This time I want to see the movie on 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 movies because I did not see 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
 so I said sure fire proof I 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 I have not even seen the trailers yet because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.460
 recently took spoiler then 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.750
 I'm going to read this month for sure. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.250
 fire is one of my own 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.320
 first readings of the month that also 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 I intend to read since the continuation 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.190
 of ana carla and I really enjoyed it and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.989
 I'm leaving the post for you guys I did 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 a video about eva or once released 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 recently I introduced and was 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740
 one of the June readings that I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 I did not both readings are 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 never before presented 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.259
 I never had any air for you, one of them is a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 of the books I received last month that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 demand audio and her daughter 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 chelsea she comes to me not this year 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.090
 and this is one of the releases that she's going to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 have autographed and everything else go forward 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.869
 in the biennial this is the first to leave it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.880
 will talk about a 14 year old girl 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.490
 was also curious to know how she 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.220
 will not write to this public 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 talking only about girls and women of the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 almost 30 years and its problems then 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.430
 also curious to know how the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 She wrote the books of 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.280
 how she addressed the problems of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:53.189
 adolescents when they took to the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:58.829
 band wants and is the same as I discovered 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:01.619
 who is the same author of error once in 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.090
 ipiaÃº is the author of eva once and goes 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.009
 Talk about a girl she woke up 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.160
 on the train track and she does not know who 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.280
 she is nothing she just knows she has 11 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.750
 inscribed in his pocket with a bird and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 who is also winning the battle now 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.070
 she will start investigating and fleeing from 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.510
 who is trying to kill her and to be 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.100
 Interestingly, the pet 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.780
 that player I'm a little person 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.780
 chooses the author's book knows that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 I also voted for this but I said this 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.480
 month may also have to count is the book 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.370
 of skindÃ´ the two worlds of astro jones 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.200
 I really do not like this campaign. 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.040
 has no interest in law because of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.300
 cover 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880
 but I have an interest in law because of 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.010
 of the author, many people recommend 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.260
 very very good authorities 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.980
 including this book itself say that it is 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.160
 very good 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.800
 only it's another one in cecap but I'm going 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.600
 read to see what it is I do not know much 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.370
 You 're a girl from the story. 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.570
 that she sees the planes and I was imagining 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.800
 stories 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.660
 then I tell you what I 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.030
 I found the next books that I 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.100
 I promise to read this month only from here. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
