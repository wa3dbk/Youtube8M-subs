going to give an overview of this

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.610 
going to give an overview of this
particular<00:00:08.429> M<00:00:08.940> sky<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.139> then<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
particular M sky I and then I'm going to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.169 
particular M sky I and then I'm going to
give<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> more<00:00:10.830> generic<00:00:11.130> overview<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:12.059> how

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
give a more generic overview of how

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.999 
give a more generic overview of how
you'd<00:00:12.330> install<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.870> sky<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> successfully<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
you'd install the sky I successfully and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.070 
you'd install the sky I successfully and
why<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.160> would<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.299> unique<00:00:15.690> features

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
why you would do so so unique features

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.750 
why you would do so so unique features
about<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.470> particular<00:00:16.650> sky<00:00:17.010> iw<00:00:17.460> lightest

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
about this particular sky iw lightest

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.570 
about this particular sky iw lightest
that<00:00:18.210> has<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.539> f-type<00:00:19.189> connector<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.400> end

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that has an f-type connector in this end

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
that has an f-type connector in this end
so<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> means<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.240> screw<00:00:21.480> attached<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
so it means that we screw attached a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
so it means that we screw attached a
cable<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.090> it's<00:00:24.090> let<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.689> less<00:00:24.869> likely

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
cable here and it's let much less likely

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.019 
cable here and it's let much less likely
to<00:00:25.260> fall<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:26.099> give<00:00:26.430> us<00:00:26.519> difficulties

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to fall out are give us difficulties

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
to fall out are give us difficulties
than<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.750> traditional<00:00:28.529> coax<00:00:29.279> your

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
than with your traditional coax your

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.279 
than with your traditional coax your
portion<00:00:29.820> types<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.480> another<00:00:30.810> great<00:00:31.080> feature

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
portion types and another great feature

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.240 
portion types and another great feature
of<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> has<00:00:33.450> m<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.710> long<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of it is that it has m this long a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610 
of it is that it has m this long a
coaxial<00:00:36.210> lead<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> output<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.410> makes

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
coaxial lead on the output which makes

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
coaxial lead on the output which makes
it<00:00:37.800> ideal<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.309> easy<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> insert<00:00:39.090> into<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it ideal and easy to insert into a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
it ideal and easy to insert into a
flat-screen<00:00:39.719> TV<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
flat-screen TV where we don't need to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
flat-screen TV where we don't need to
push<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> sky<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> directly<00:00:42.600> into<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> thing

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
push the sky I directly into the thing

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
push the sky I directly into the thing
we<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> short<00:00:43.980> lead<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> if

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
we can use a short lead to do so and if

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.389 
we can use a short lead to do so and if
we<00:00:45.840> look<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.680> sensor<00:00:47.190> here

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
we look here then we have a sensor here

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.310 
we look here then we have a sensor here
which<00:00:47.879> would<00:00:48.090> normally<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> pick<00:00:49.200> up

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
which would normally use that to pick up

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.490 
which would normally use that to pick up
the<00:00:49.379> signal<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.760> detach<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> onto

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the signal and we detach this and onto

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
the signal and we detach this and onto
the<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.980> television<00:00:53.250> using<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.180> as

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the top of the television using this as

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
the top of the television using this as
a<00:00:54.390> pad<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.199> comes<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a pad that comes with it it's a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
a pad that comes with it it's a
double-sided<00:00:56.610> sticky<00:00:57.090> pad<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> few

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
double-sided sticky pad so there's a few

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.590 
double-sided sticky pad so there's a few
great<00:00:58.770> unique<00:00:59.129> features<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.910> finally

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
great unique features on it and finally

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
great unique features on it and finally
technically<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> great<00:01:02.010> sky<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
technically this is a great sky I in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
technically this is a great sky I in
test<00:01:03.510> we've<00:01:03.690> done<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:04.170> long<00:01:04.739> cable<00:01:05.220> runs<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
test we've done on long cable runs this

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.179 
test we've done on long cable runs this
will<00:01:06.119> definitely<00:01:06.330> stay<00:01:06.810> working<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.890> much

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
will definitely stay working on much

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.390 
will definitely stay working on much
lower<00:01:08.630> amperages<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:10.020> other<00:01:10.380> skies<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
lower amperages than other skies so it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
lower amperages than other skies so it
just<00:01:11.610> means<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.170> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
just means that you know it's more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
just means that you know it's more
robust<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.189> better<00:01:14.369> sky<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> think<00:01:15.000> in

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
robust it's a better sky I think in

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.700 
robust it's a better sky I think in
general<00:01:15.509> design<00:01:15.960> than<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.320> other<00:01:16.500> ones

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
general design than any other ones

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
general design than any other ones
repair<00:01:17.070> sir<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.330> now

repair sir so what I'm going to do now
is<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.900> talk<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:19.979> use

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is just talk about when would we use

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.660 
is just talk about when would we use
this<00:01:20.490> sky<00:01:20.759> i<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.450> basically<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.340> if<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
this sky i but basically and if we had a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.820 
this sky i but basically and if we had a
scenario<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.210> where<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> had<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> skybox<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
scenario here where we had a skybox and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
scenario here where we had a skybox and
say<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> living<00:01:26.460> room<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.090> wanted<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
say in a living room and we wanted to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
say in a living room and we wanted to
connect<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> second<00:01:28.380> television<00:01:28.860> for

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
connect it to a second television for

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.240 
connect it to a second television for
instance<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> kitchen<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.450> bedroom<00:01:30.810> on

instance in a kitchen or in a bedroom on
the<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> Sky<00:01:32.820> box<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> great

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the back of the Sky box is a great

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080 
the back of the Sky box is a great
feature<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.170> which<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> an<00:01:34.860> RF<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.549> output

feature here which is an RF to output
okay<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> there's<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:37.619> features<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
okay and there's two features to it it's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.270 
okay and there's two features to it it's
our<00:01:39.000> f'ing<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.049> gives<00:01:40.380> an<00:01:40.470> RF<00:01:40.710> output<00:01:41.130> which

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
our f'ing it gives an RF output which

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.740 
our f'ing it gives an RF output which
means<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.759> roll<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.909> ruin<00:01:42.270> our<00:01:42.360> good<00:01:42.600> watch

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
means we can roll it ruin our good watch

overview<00:02:06.990> how<00:02:07.410> would<00:02:07.530> install<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.280> what

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
overview how would install one and what

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
overview how would install one and what
I've<00:02:08.729> done<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.210> I've<00:02:09.390> preassembled<00:02:10.140> this

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
I've done here is I've preassembled this

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.890 
I've done here is I've preassembled this
cable<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.880> end<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.300> put<00:02:12.720> on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
cable and we can see on one end I put on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.290 
cable and we can see on one end I put on
this<00:02:13.080> coaxial<00:02:13.980> female<00:02:14.340> connector<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
this coaxial female connector and on the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.480 
this coaxial female connector and on the
far<00:02:15.510> end<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:15.930> terminated<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:17.130> an<00:02:17.340> F

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.370 
far end are terminated it with an F
connector<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.750> we'd<00:02:18.900> normally<00:02:18.990> be<00:02:19.290> doing

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
connector so what we'd normally be doing

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.750 
connector so what we'd normally be doing
here<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.770> we'd<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:20.010> running<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.310> cable<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:21.570> this

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
here is we'd be running a cable of this

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
here is we'd be running a cable of this
output<00:02:23.760> here<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.120> running<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> second

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
output here and running it to a second

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
output here and running it to a second
location<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> purpose<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.000> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
location now for the purpose of this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.310 
location now for the purpose of this
demonstration<00:02:27.360> we're<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.200> run

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
demonstration we're just going to run

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.080 
demonstration we're just going to run
into<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.590> guy<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.490> my<00:02:29.610> hand<00:02:29.820> here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
into this guy I that's in my hand here

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.390 
into this guy I that's in my hand here
so<00:02:32.630> we'll<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.660> notice<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.350> first<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.310> all

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
so we'll just notice here first of all

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640 
so we'll just notice here first of all
that<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> very<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:37.020> firm<00:02:37.320> connection

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
that we get a very good firm connection

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.400 
that we get a very good firm connection
here<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:39.030> quite<00:02:39.570> tight<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:39.990> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
here and it's quite tight like that and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.260 
here and it's quite tight like that and
the<00:02:41.250> other<00:02:41.370> thing<00:02:41.430> we'll<00:02:41.640> notice<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.180> LED

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
the other thing we'll notice is the LED

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.450 
the other thing we'll notice is the LED
light<00:02:42.990> hasn't<00:02:43.260> come<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.130> hasn't<00:02:44.280> come

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
light hasn't come on and it hasn't come

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.340 
light hasn't come on and it hasn't come
on<00:02:44.670> simply<00:02:45.060> because<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.540> haven't<00:02:45.900> turned<00:02:46.170> on

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
on simply because I haven't turned on

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.650 
on simply because I haven't turned on
the<00:02:46.560> 9-volt<00:02:46.950> or<00:02:47.250> if<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.240> box<00:02:48.450> yet

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
the 9-volt or if I put on this box yet

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.090 
the 9-volt or if I put on this box yet
so<00:02:49.140> what<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.320> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.980> I'm

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
so what I'm going to do here is I'm

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
simply<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.520> run<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.910> across<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
simply going to run this across here and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.480 
simply going to run this across here and
I'm<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.320> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.500> demonstrate<00:02:52.710> this<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
I'm just going to demonstrate this and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.760 
I'm just going to demonstrate this and
where<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> sky<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.690> more<00:02:55.050> or<00:02:55.140> less<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.350> path<00:02:55.530> by

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
where the sky is more or less in path by

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.370 
where the sky is more or less in path by
our<00:02:55.980> pasture<00:02:56.550> mode<00:02:56.760> initially<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.140> see

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
our pasture mode initially so if we see

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.490 
our pasture mode initially so if we see
here<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.790> coaxial<00:03:00.420> input<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.080> so

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
here we have a coaxial input here so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.420 
here we have a coaxial input here so
we're<00:03:01.680> going<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.160> we're<00:03:02.280> going<00:03:02.370> to

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.790 
we're going to do here is we're going to
connect<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.290> lead<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:07.080> push<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.500> firmly

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
connect this lead just push it in firmly

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430 
connect this lead just push it in firmly
there<00:03:08.100> I'm<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> rotate<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:10.290> can

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there I'm just going to rotate you can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.630 
there I'm just going to rotate you can
see<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.739> they're<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.489> going<00:03:11.580> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
see that they're now just going to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.520 
see that they're now just going to
rotate<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.120> television<00:03:12.600> around<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
rotate this television around so the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
rotate this television around so the
first<00:03:13.709> thing<00:03:13.890> we're<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.280> here<00:03:14.459> is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
first thing we're going to do here is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.170 
first thing we're going to do here is
actually<00:03:14.700> tune<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:20.190> take<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
actually tune this in to a to take the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.090 
actually tune this in to a to take the
output<00:03:21.390> from<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.380> there'd<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.770> certain

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
output from this so there'd be a certain

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.229 
output from this so there'd be a certain
channel<00:03:23.430> number<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.820> will<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.060> been

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
channel number that will have been

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.300 
channel number that will have been
chosen<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.900> box<00:03:25.080> already<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.920> what<00:03:26.160> we're

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
chosen on this box already so what we're

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.440 
chosen on this box already so what we're
going<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.520> do<00:03:26.640> at<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.880> point<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.270> we're

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
going to do at this point is we're

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.979 
going to do at this point is we're
simply<00:03:27.750> going<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.930> come<00:03:28.080> down<00:03:28.260> here<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.989> we

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
simply going to come down here and we

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.979 
simply going to come down here and we
will<00:03:31.170> tune<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.340> same<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.989> frequency

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
will tune in and the same and frequency

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.720 
will tune in and the same and frequency
here<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.650> what<00:03:34.739> we'll<00:03:34.860> do<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.190> I'll<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.550> go

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
here so what we'll do is I'll just go

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.470 
here so what we'll do is I'll just go
arrow<00:03:36.390> over<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:38.790> come<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> search

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
arrow over and we come down to search

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.729 
arrow over and we come down to search
and<00:03:39.780> I'm<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.050> going<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> begin<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.530> search

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
and I'm just going to begin a search

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.040 
and I'm just going to begin a search
here<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> work<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.360> way<00:03:42.390> true<00:03:42.780> here

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
here so to work all the way true here

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.030 
here so to work all the way true here
after<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.620> finds<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.220> end<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.550> channel<00:03:45.620> and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.229 

now<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.100> can<00:03:50.430> also<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.850> scenario<00:03:51.209> where

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
now you can also have a scenario where

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.120 
now you can also have a scenario where
be<00:03:51.480> mixing<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.170> with<00:03:52.380> existing<00:03:52.680> and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
be mixing this in with existing and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.979 
be mixing this in with existing and
terrestrial<00:03:54.000> channels<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.750> particular

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
terrestrial channels in this particular

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.050 
terrestrial channels in this particular
setup<00:03:55.380> it's<00:03:55.709> only<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.280> output<00:03:56.459> from<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> Sky

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
setup it's only the output from the Sky

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.250 
setup it's only the output from the Sky
box<00:03:57.269> that's<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:58.100> set<00:03:59.100> up<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.110> see

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
box that's in this set up so you can see

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.660 
box that's in this set up so you can see
here<00:04:04.470> we've<00:04:04.590> actually<00:04:04.709> come<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.040> I'm<00:04:05.400> going

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
here we've actually come down I'm going

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.850 
here we've actually come down I'm going
to<00:04:05.760> store<00:04:06.060> instead<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.870> I'll<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.560> arrow

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
to store instead and I'll just arrow

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.340 
to store instead and I'll just arrow
over<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.880> we've<00:04:09.120> storage<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.840> I'll<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.230> go

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
over and we've storage and I'll just go

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.870 
over and we've storage and I'll just go
to<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> menu<00:04:10.590> button<00:04:11.010> out<00:04:11.190> what<00:04:11.610> we<00:04:11.730> actually

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
to the menu button out what we actually

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.780 
to the menu button out what we actually
have<00:04:12.209> there<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:13.050> have<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.640> we<00:04:14.640> have<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
have there is we have and we have the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.060 
have there is we have and we have the
output<00:04:15.210> from<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.480> now<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.500> problem<00:04:16.950> is

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
output from this now but the problem is

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.500 
output from this now but the problem is
and<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.460> reason<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.760> I'm<00:04:18.239> demonstrating

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
and the reason that I'm demonstrating

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.970 
and the reason that I'm demonstrating
this<00:04:18.960> way

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
this way

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.770 
this way
with<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> sky<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.430> turned<00:04:20.880> off<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.630> can

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
with the sky I turned off we can

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.390 
with the sky I turned off we can
actually<00:04:21.930> look<00:04:22.200> at<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.500> but<00:04:22.890> only<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.370> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
actually look at this but only with the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.190 
actually look at this but only with the
sky<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.640> turned<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.630> we<00:04:24.750> actually<00:04:24.900> come

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
sky I turned on can we actually come

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.780 
sky I turned on can we actually come
along<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.740> pick<00:04:26.040> up<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.280> remote<00:04:26.640> control

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
along and pick up this remote control

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.510 
along and pick up this remote control
our<00:04:27.450> remotely<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.200> change<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.920> channels<00:04:29.250> now

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
our remotely a change of channels now

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.740 
our remotely a change of channels now
one<00:04:29.730> day<00:04:29.880> I'm<00:04:29.940> going<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.120> demonstrate<00:04:30.420> this

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
one day I'm going to demonstrate this

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.510 
one day I'm going to demonstrate this
piece<00:04:30.960> -<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.830> normally<00:04:32.130> where<00:04:32.280> we<00:04:32.340> used

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
piece - this is normally where we used

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.430 
piece - this is normally where we used
this<00:04:32.670> sticky<00:04:33.000> pad<00:04:33.180> we'd<00:04:33.630> simply<00:04:33.810> pull<00:04:34.110> off<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
this sticky pad we'd simply pull off the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.230 
this sticky pad we'd simply pull off the
white<00:04:34.590> front<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.070> back<00:04:35.190> on<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.640> use<00:04:36.030> this

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
white front and back on it and use this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.120 
white front and back on it and use this
to<00:04:36.450> stick<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> sensor<00:04:37.200> onto<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.860> front<00:04:37.980> of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
to stick the sensor onto the front of

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.650 
to stick the sensor onto the front of
the<00:04:38.220> television<00:04:38.460> atop<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.120> television<00:04:39.540> like

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the television atop the television like

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.810 
the television atop the television like
this<00:04:39.840> ok<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.770> that's<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.980> great<00:04:41.160> sort<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.520> handy

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
this ok so that's a great sort of handy

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.400 
this ok so that's a great sort of handy
different<00:04:42.060> feature<00:04:42.210> because<00:04:42.750> if<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:42.990> sensor

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
different feature because if this sensor

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.750 
different feature because if this sensor
keeps<00:04:43.560> falling<00:04:43.830> down<00:04:44.070> behind<00:04:44.220> television

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
keeps falling down behind television

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.090 
keeps falling down behind television
this<00:04:45.030> guy<00:04:45.270> just<00:04:45.630> won't<00:04:45.780> be<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:46.020> any<00:04:46.110> use<00:04:46.230> so<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
this guy just won't be of any use so the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.320 
this guy just won't be of any use so the
next<00:04:47.280> step<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.760> process<00:04:47.940> they're

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
next step in the process they're

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.000 
next step in the process they're
actually<00:04:48.660> going<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.020> installers<00:04:49.590> menu<00:04:49.890> on

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
actually going to the installers menu on

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.300 
actually going to the installers menu on
the<00:04:50.100> Sky<00:04:50.310> box<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.620> actually<00:04:52.620> demonstrate<00:04:52.770> how

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the Sky box and actually demonstrate how

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.760 
the Sky box and actually demonstrate how
to<00:04:53.340> turn<00:04:53.640> on<00:04:53.760> this<00:04:54.030> output<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.380> what<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:55.560> can<00:04:55.650> do

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
to turn on this output so what we can do

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.230 
to turn on this output so what we can do
with<00:04:55.890> this<00:04:56.010> point<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.490> will<00:04:56.700> actually<00:04:57.000> come

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
with this point is will actually come

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.420 
with this point is will actually come
we'll<00:04:57.720> hit<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.930> services<00:04:58.500> button<00:04:58.740> we'll<00:04:59.310> go

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
we'll hit the services button we'll go

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.670 
we'll hit the services button we'll go
to<00:04:59.490> option<00:05:00.030> number<00:05:00.060> 4<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.930> then<00:05:01.290> in<00:05:01.470> quick

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
to option number 4 and then in quick

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.270 
to option number 4 and then in quick
succession

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
succession

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.420 
succession
I<00:05:02.400> go<00:05:02.550> 0<00:05:03.030> 1<00:05:03.450> select<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.770> come<00:05:05.010> down<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
I go 0 1 select and I come down to the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.250 
I go 0 1 select and I come down to the
RF<00:05:05.790> outputs<00:05:06.270> which<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.690> see<00:05:06.840> here<00:05:07.110> I

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
RF outputs which you can see here I

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.460 
RF outputs which you can see here I
select<00:05:08.010> ok<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.910> we<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.120> see<00:05:09.450> here<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.440> can

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
select ok and we can see here that I can

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.750 
select ok and we can see here that I can
turn<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:11.070> from<00:05:11.280> an<00:05:11.400> off<00:05:11.580> position<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:13.320> on<00:05:14.250> and

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
turn this from an off position to on and

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.340 
turn this from an off position to on and
hit<00:05:15.600> there<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:16.080> save<00:05:16.500> settings<00:05:18.020> at<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.140> first

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
hit there at save settings at the first

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.900 
hit there at save settings at the first
thing<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.650> notice<00:05:19.980> here<00:05:20.160> is<00:05:20.220> if<00:05:20.550> we<00:05:20.670> actually

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
thing we notice here is if we actually

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.260 
thing we notice here is if we actually
come<00:05:21.270> along<00:05:21.510> here<00:05:21.780> now<00:05:22.610> we'll<00:05:23.610> see<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.760> LED

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
come along here now we'll see the LED

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.620 
come along here now we'll see the LED
light<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.540> on<00:05:24.840> so<00:05:25.050> if<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.530> come<00:05:25.770> along<00:05:25.950> now<00:05:26.280> I

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
light is on so if I come along now I

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.920 
light is on so if I come along now I
actually<00:05:27.630> aimed<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.590> remote<00:05:28.860> control<00:05:29.220> here<00:05:29.490> I

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
actually aimed the remote control here I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.390 
actually aimed the remote control here I
can<00:05:30.930> actually<00:05:31.200> change<00:05:31.440> channels<00:05:31.890> up<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.250> down

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
can actually change channels up and down

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.520 
can actually change channels up and down
so<00:05:32.850> what's<00:05:33.060> happening<00:05:33.420> here<00:05:33.600> is<00:05:33.780> it's<00:05:34.140> taking

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
so what's happening here is it's taking

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.080 
so what's happening here is it's taking
the<00:05:34.560> signal<00:05:35.010> from<00:05:35.460> this<00:05:35.640> remote<00:05:35.940> control

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
the signal from this remote control

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.690 
the signal from this remote control
picking<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.110> up<00:05:37.200> in<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.410> sensor<00:05:37.830> running<00:05:38.610> a

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
picking it up in the sensor running a

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.150 
picking it up in the sensor running a
true<00:05:38.940> this<00:05:39.090> cable<00:05:39.540> directly<00:05:40.380> into<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.010> back

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
true this cable directly into the back

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.740 
true this cable directly into the back
of<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.430> box<00:05:41.640> which<00:05:41.880> we<00:05:42.000> demonstrated<00:05:42.600> here

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
of the box which we demonstrated here

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.840 
of the box which we demonstrated here
earlier<00:05:43.170> and<00:05:43.620> it's<00:05:43.800> passing<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.340> signal<00:05:44.700> in

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
earlier and it's passing the signal in

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.490 
earlier and it's passing the signal in
there<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.240> Sky<00:05:45.420> box<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.870> saying<00:05:46.020> change

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
there to the Sky box and saying change

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.750 
there to the Sky box and saying change
channel<00:05:47.010> do<00:05:47.160> this<00:05:47.340> do<00:05:47.580> that

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
channel do this do that

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.570 
channel do this do that
ok<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:48.840> we<00:05:49.080> can<00:05:49.230> do<00:05:49.320> also<00:05:49.650> at<00:05:49.920> that<00:05:50.040> point<00:05:50.310> if<00:05:50.490> we

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
ok so we can do also at that point if we

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.940 
ok so we can do also at that point if we
wish<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:51.180> we<00:05:52.020> can<00:05:52.140> actually<00:05:52.500> come<00:05:52.620> along<00:05:52.800> we

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
wish to is we can actually come along we

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.590 
wish to is we can actually come along we
could<00:05:53.070> change<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.520> output<00:05:53.700> number<00:05:54.090> here<00:05:54.390> from

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
could change the output number here from

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.820 
could change the output number here from
68<00:05:55.080> or<00:05:55.260> something<00:05:55.530> else

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
68 or something else

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.410 
68 or something else
so<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:56.100> could<00:05:56.280> set<00:05:56.460> me<00:05:56.550> for<00:05:56.700> instance<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.120> 50

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
so I could set me for instance the 50

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.470 
so I could set me for instance the 50
for<00:05:57.980> the<00:05:58.980> first<00:05:59.160> thing<00:05:59.370> if<00:05:59.820> I<00:05:59.940> actually<00:06:00.180> save

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
for the first thing if I actually save

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.560 
for the first thing if I actually save
those<00:06:00.720> changes<00:06:01.280> this<00:06:02.280> screen<00:06:02.550> goes<00:06:02.790> back<00:06:03.030> but

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
those changes this screen goes back but

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.290 
those changes this screen goes back but
if<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:03.780> change<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.260> here<00:06:04.500> to<00:06:04.980> 68<00:06:05.490> now<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:05.940> reason

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
if I change it here to 68 now the reason

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.540 
if I change it here to 68 now the reason
it<00:06:06.390> allows<00:06:06.600> you<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:06.870> change<00:06:07.080> that<00:06:07.320> is<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.950> the

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
it allows you to change that is in the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.880 
it allows you to change that is in the
in<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.030> event<00:06:09.360> that<00:06:09.810> there's<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.200> frequency

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
in the event that there's a frequency

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.410 
in the event that there's a frequency
that<00:06:11.040> frequency<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.640> news<00:06:11.850> by<00:06:12.030> local

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
that frequency the news by local

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.790 
that frequency the news by local
transmitter<00:06:12.900> or<00:06:13.050> something<00:06:13.290> of<00:06:13.380> that<00:06:13.410> and

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
transmitter or something of that and

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.150 
transmitter or something of that and
allow<00:06:14.070> you<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.310> avoid<00:06:14.580> them<00:06:15.800> conflict<00:06:16.800> so<00:06:17.070> you

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
allow you to avoid them conflict so you

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.380 
allow you to avoid them conflict so you
can<00:06:17.280> pick<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.460> channel<00:06:17.730> that's<00:06:17.940> not<00:06:18.090> part

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
can pick a channel that's not part

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.580 
can pick a channel that's not part
currently<00:06:18.810> being<00:06:18.990> used<00:06:19.200> ok<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:20.330> am<00:06:21.330> I<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:22.440> want

it comes in a 2 and 4 wave version which
we<00:06:34.840> have<00:06:34.990> here<00:06:35.170> so<00:06:35.590> that<00:06:35.770> we<00:06:35.950> have<00:06:35.980> an<00:06:36.160> input

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
we have here so that we have an input

here<00:06:38.740> we<00:06:39.190> can<00:06:39.340> actually<00:06:39.460> do<00:06:39.730> that<00:06:39.880> we<00:06:40.120> could

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
here we can actually do that we could

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.210 
here we can actually do that we could
run<00:06:40.420> this<00:06:40.600> for<00:06:40.990> different<00:06:41.230> rooms<00:06:41.620> and<00:06:41.860> have

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
run this for different rooms and have

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.100 
run this for different rooms and have

certainly<00:07:18.310> you<00:07:18.760> can<00:07:18.910> you<00:07:19.150> can<00:07:19.270> just<00:07:19.450> use<00:07:19.660> this

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
certainly you can you can just use this

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.780 
certainly you can you can just use this

to<00:07:33.730> air<00:07:33.850> boxes<00:07:34.300> but<00:07:34.630> the<00:07:34.720> disadvantage<00:07:35.260> to

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.290 
to air boxes but the disadvantage to

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.520 
to air boxes but the disadvantage to
this<00:07:35.470> is<00:07:35.650> is<00:07:35.770> a<00:07:35.800> relatively<00:07:36.220> expensive<00:07:36.550> 4m

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
this is is a relatively expensive 4m

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.020 
this is is a relatively expensive 4m
piece<00:07:38.530> of<00:07:38.680> cage<00:07:38.830> both<00:07:39.340> of<00:07:39.430> them<00:07:39.580> but<00:07:39.880> it's

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
piece of cage both of them but it's

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.490 
piece of cage both of them but it's
certainly<00:07:40.300> extremely<00:07:40.630> effective<00:07:41.230> so

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
certainly extremely effective so

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.960 
certainly extremely effective so
hopefully<00:07:41.710> anybody<00:07:42.130> found<00:07:42.310> this<00:07:42.550> good<00:07:42.760> an
