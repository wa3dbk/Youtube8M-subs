details<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.820> basically<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
details on that but basically what you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.780 
details on that but basically what you
do<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> insert<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> chain<00:01:23.460> between

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
do is insert this in the chain between

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.859 
do is insert this in the chain between
your<00:01:24.299> power<00:01:24.659> supply<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.729> your<00:01:26.729> pedal<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.659> this

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
your power supply and your pedal in this

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.960 
your power supply and your pedal in this
case<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.259> using<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.650> Vic<00:01:28.829> Audio<00:01:29.159> fuzz<00:01:29.549> pedal

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
case I'm using a Vic Audio fuzz pedal

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.969 
case I'm using a Vic Audio fuzz pedal
this<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:30.750> work<00:01:30.900> great<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.409> any<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this will work great on any kind of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.999 
this will work great on any kind of
analog<00:01:32.310> pedal<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> fuzz's<00:01:33.509> waz<00:01:33.930> delays<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
analog pedal be it fuzz's waz delays and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.090 
analog pedal be it fuzz's waz delays and
it<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:35.729> treat<00:01:36.659> each<00:01:36.869> pedal<00:01:37.140> differently<00:01:37.890> so

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it will treat each pedal differently so

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910 
it will treat each pedal differently so
it's<00:01:38.250> fun<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> experiment<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.799> figure<00:01:40.799> out

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's fun to experiment and figure out

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.749 
it's fun to experiment and figure out
what<00:01:41.070> works<00:01:41.250> best<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.850> different<00:01:42.450> pedals<00:01:43.759> one

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
what works best on different pedals one

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
what works best on different pedals one
thing<00:01:44.970> you'll<00:01:45.149> notice<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.470> effect<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
thing you'll notice when the effect is

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.060 
thing you'll notice when the effect is
engaged<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> begin<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.740> dial

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
engaged is that as you begin to dial

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
engaged is that as you begin to dial
back<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.729> voltage<00:01:51.090> being<00:01:51.420> fed<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> pedal

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
back the voltage being fed to the pedal

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.010 
back the voltage being fed to the pedal
the<00:01:52.590> LED<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.340> start<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.729> dim<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.899> when

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the LED will start to dim and then when

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.899 
the LED will start to dim and then when
you<00:01:55.110> crank<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.189> feeding<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> full

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you crank it back up to feeding the full

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.649 
you crank it back up to feeding the full
nine<00:01:57.119> volts<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.350> bright<00:01:59.040> LED<00:01:59.659> so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
nine volts you get the bright LED so

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.179 
nine volts you get the bright LED so
there<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.590> let's<00:02:01.860> hear<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
there you have it let's hear what it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.160 
there you have it let's hear what it
sounds<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.750> there's<00:02:03.930> no

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
sounds like and I think there's no

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.500 
sounds like and I think there's no
better<00:02:04.469> choice<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:05.189> song

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
better choice of song

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.980 
better choice of song
and<00:02:06.980> scorpions<00:02:07.980> tune<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> 80s<00:02:09.450> so

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
and scorpions tune from the 80s so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:22.839 
and scorpions tune from the 80s so
here's<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.290> full<00:02:10.680> nine<00:02:10.890> volts

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.140 

85%<00:02:23.499> you'll<00:02:24.499> hear<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.799> tone<00:02:25.010> get<00:02:25.280> quieter<00:02:25.849> and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
85% you'll hear the tone get quieter and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.520 
85% you'll hear the tone get quieter and
also<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> little<00:02:26.780> softer

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.850 

50%<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.730> you'll<00:02:39.480> hear<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.900> starts<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.440> cut<00:02:40.740> out

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
50% and you'll hear it starts to cut out

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.340 
50% and you'll hear it starts to cut out
much<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> gated<00:02:41.790> fuzz<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.020> decays

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
much like a gated fuzz so the decays

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:55.180 
much like a gated fuzz so the decays
will<00:02:43.709> definitely<00:02:44.130> become<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.670> pronounced

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.650 

just<00:02:56.190> by<00:02:56.310> turning<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> knob<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.510> want

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
just by turning the knob so if you want

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.600 
just by turning the knob so if you want
a<00:02:57.720> little<00:02:57.870> bit<00:02:57.989> more<00:02:58.319> or<00:02:58.680> less<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.250> dial

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
a little bit more or less you can dial

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.640 
a little bit more or less you can dial
it<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:01.020> create<00:03:01.350> some

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it in and you can really create some

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.040 
it in and you can really create some
kind<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.920> nasty<00:03:02.160> snarling<00:03:02.940> effects<00:03:03.300> with<00:03:03.540> fuzz

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
kind of nasty snarling effects with fuzz

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.320 
kind of nasty snarling effects with fuzz
pedals

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.440 

down<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.590> about<00:03:10.740> 25%<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.880> at<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.060> point<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
down to about 25% so at this point the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.240 
down to about 25% so at this point the
pedals<00:03:12.750> only<00:03:13.020> getting<00:03:13.260> about<00:03:13.320> 6<00:03:13.740> volts<00:03:14.100> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
pedals only getting about 6 volts of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:25.490 
pedals only getting about 6 volts of
power

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.360 

so<00:03:26.500> there<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.769> have<00:03:26.830> it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
