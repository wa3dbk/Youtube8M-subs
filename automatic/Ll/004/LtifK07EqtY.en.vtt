00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.620
 good afternoon today i will cook 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.719
 apple marmalade 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 although it seems to everyone that marmalade 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.250
 getting ready is very complicated and easier to buy 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.609
 in the store he is actually preparing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.869
 very quickly principle is required of everything 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.840
 only with the ingredient 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 I have apple juice - 400 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 milliliters and 400 milliliters 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.529
 apple juice I need 3 teaspoons 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.300
 spoons agar-agar and half a glass of sugar i 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 I want my marmalade to be like this 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 so sour and sugar and I take 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840
 pretty little half glass if you want 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.750
 You can take a bit more 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.059
 Sahara 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 the juice I have is freshly squeezed and boiled 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 now in the pot I poured a little 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 juice 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.680
 somewhere literally milliliters 5070 and in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.610
 the remaining juice I will add 3 tea 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 spoons agar-agar 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 agar-agar is so natural 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 gelatin substitute can 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.549
 use and gelatin and carefully 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 mix and leave to swell for 20 minutes 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:28.140
 while in this cast juice 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.659
 add sugar and bring to a boil here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.900
 apple juice and brought to a boil to this 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.530
 I have already sweetened the agar-agar 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530
 add 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.299
 stir and boil again 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.850
 until the mass boils you can now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.259
 taste exactly if you 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.439
 read what is now at the moment 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.829
 a little sugar there is still the possibility 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:59.540
 add sugar is still very much a sine 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.610
 hot sugar still have time to dissolve 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.649
 Well, I have a little connection to run 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.780
 thickened she left a little bit like that 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.479
 has become 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.120
 and while it boils yet the mixture is very 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 hot and and I will spill on such 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.370
 silicone molds nothing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.400
 do not lubricate from silicone housing 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.250
 then marmalade and earlier will get and so 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.060
 it's very easy to be a little bit of an hour 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 it is necessary to pour in molds 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.530
 it is a hot mixture because 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.050
 agar-agar very quickly begins 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.090
 freeze 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.280
 I will spill on all remaining 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 Forms and section poured marmalade on 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.310
 I had this for this 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.160
 inside is pretty big silicone 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.550
 shape so it turns out a lot 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.060
 such marmalade and now leave to 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.120
 full cooling to full solidification 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.540
 somewhere it will take me about part 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.900
 2 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.150
 about an hour has passed the marmalade has already frozen 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.080
 over stay so beautiful glossy 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.720
 and now every marmeladin supplies i 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.370
 pulled out a silicone mold like this 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.100
 dip 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.750
 shake sugar a little 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.650
 here it turns out ready marmalade and so 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.650
 each was done 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.159
 the marmalade is completely ready I advise you 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.680
 cook this recipe 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.900
 very light marmalade is obtained 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.260
 very, very tasty 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.829
 different from store marmalade to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.829
