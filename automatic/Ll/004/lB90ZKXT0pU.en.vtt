00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
play this and what that was was a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
play this and what that was was a
c-sharp<00:01:14.340> Phrygian<00:01:14.939> minor<00:01:15.150> leg<00:01:15.900> which<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> from

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
c-sharp Phrygian minor leg which is from

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.480 
c-sharp Phrygian minor leg which is from
the<00:01:16.740> key<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> major

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the key of a major

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.780 
the key of a major
we're<00:01:18.330> alternate<00:01:18.750> picking<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.350> note<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
we're alternate picking every note and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.030 
we're alternate picking every note and
it's<00:01:20.790> four<00:01:21.119> fingers<00:01:21.570> per<00:01:22.290> string<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.860> you're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's four fingers per string so you're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
it's four fingers per string so you're
really<00:01:23.280> stretching<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
