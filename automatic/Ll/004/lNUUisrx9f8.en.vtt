now

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.910 
now
it's<00:01:36.300> best<00:01:36.830> but<00:01:37.830> on<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.310> downside<00:01:39.080> I<00:01:40.080> think

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's best but on the downside I think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's best but on the downside I think
it's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:42.690> isn't<00:01:43.020> very

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
it's a little bit this isn't very

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's a little bit this isn't very
intuitive<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.760> quite<00:01:45.000> heavy<00:01:45.150> obviously

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
intuitive and it's quite heavy obviously

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
intuitive and it's quite heavy obviously

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that leaving your waist down and so why

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.960 
that leaving your waist down and so why
did<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> work<00:01:51.240> um<00:01:52.400> there's<00:01:53.400> quite<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> straight

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
did it work um there's quite a straight

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.770 
did it work um there's quite a straight
for<00:01:54.150> reason<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.760> there's<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.820> price<00:01:57.120> tag<00:01:57.330> that
