00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.569
 the water level in Baikal dropped by 6 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.420
 centimeters below the critical mark 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.719
 this happened for the first time in the last 30 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.090
 years old 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.889
 shallowing of the lake has already led to problems 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 with water supply in a few 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 nearby locations 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.550
 experts also fear that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.900
 lack of water will harm the ecosystem 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.400
 Baikal 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 I think that huge damage is coming for 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.099
 ecology because not replaced 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 water level changes completely 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.530
 vegetation and flora and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 fauna everything goes change because if 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.629
 before this was not noticed what is already 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 it was created by nature 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 natural environment yes then 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 now comes the deepest violation and here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.489
 it is now on Wednesday it is changing and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 no one knows what the consequences for all 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 this will lead scientists and environmentalists say 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 that shoaling baikal affected so 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 dry summer so growing 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 water consumption lake 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.210
 Irkutsk hydroelectric flower 2014 was 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 about two thirds of the norm 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.189
 naturally 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 it is not allowed to fill the glass to give them 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.960
 marks that were usually previous 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.399
 September has already begun to decline 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:30.270
 therefore , in the autumn it became clear that 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:34.440
 mark 456 will be overcome there is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.600
 in view of the downside with this scientific 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.610
 cynological institute employee not 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 sees a big threat to baikal because 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.319
 lowering the water level in the water stories 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
 Baikal mode in the history of this system 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.860
 Baikal 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.979
 there were more significant fluctuations 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.940
 more they were you the same after when 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850
 level 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.130
 baikal and began to regulate the nasty 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.899
 piece gs 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 experts expect that the waters of Baikal will begin 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.069
 increase in volume only at the end 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.190
 April mid-May together with melting 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.600
 ices meanwhile a number of scientists and environmentalists 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.060
 criticize the decision of the Russian 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.130
 governments allow irkutsk hydroelectric station 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 use the water resources of baikal in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.140
 the time of his shallowing Buryatia already complain 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.209
 to reduce fish populations which 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.940
 affects the fish industry by region 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.070
 In addition, according to ecologists, there is shallow water. 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.640
 Baikal will lead more frequent forest 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.640
 fires
