00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.190 

okay<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.769> changing<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.210> fuel<00:00:12.900> pump

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
okay we are changing out the fuel pump

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.790 
okay we are changing out the fuel pump
for<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.670> 2000<00:00:14.670> GMC<00:00:14.900> Sierra<00:00:15.900> pickup<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.680> I

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
for a 2000 GMC Sierra pickup which I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.500 
for a 2000 GMC Sierra pickup which I
guess<00:00:16.949> would<00:00:17.100> also<00:00:17.279> be<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> Chevy<00:00:17.850> Silverado

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
guess would also be a Chevy Silverado

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.029 
guess would also be a Chevy Silverado
this<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> v8<00:00:20.570> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> small<00:00:22.140> v8<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> 305

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this is a v8 this is a small v8 the 305

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
this is a v8 this is a small v8 the 305
and<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> new<00:00:25.199> fuel<00:00:25.529> pump<00:00:26.599> this<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and this is the new fuel pump this is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.710 
and this is the new fuel pump this is
the<00:00:27.930> old<00:00:28.170> fuel<00:00:28.560> pump<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.160> had<00:00:29.880> two<00:00:30.090> problems

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the old fuel pump I had two problems

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.479 
the old fuel pump I had two problems
that<00:00:31.500> starts<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:32.610> were<00:00:32.669> irregular<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.540> I

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
that starts they were irregular and I

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.690 
that starts they were irregular and I
also<00:00:35.489> had<00:00:35.790> trouble<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:37.250> fuel<00:00:38.250> gauge<00:00:38.280> not

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
also had trouble with my fuel gauge not

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
also had trouble with my fuel gauge not
working<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.989> as<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> side

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
working which I can see now as a side

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.760 
working which I can see now as a side
piece<00:00:41.149> has<00:00:42.149> almost<00:00:42.780> no<00:00:42.989> connectivity<00:00:43.620> here

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
piece has almost no connectivity here

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380 
piece has almost no connectivity here
we're<00:00:43.980> supposed<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.399> touch<00:00:44.610> versus<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we're supposed to touch versus here I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
we're supposed to touch versus here I
can<00:00:45.600> tell<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> big<00:00:46.200> difference<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.860> those

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
can tell it's a big difference so those

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.700 
can tell it's a big difference so those
two<00:00:47.670> problems<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.360> both<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> same<00:00:48.960> unit

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
two problems are both from the same unit

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
two problems are both from the same unit
which<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> believe<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.789> new<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.420> about<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
which I believe I got new for about a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
which I believe I got new for about a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
did was take this unit a big ol thing

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.420 
did was take this unit a big ol thing
that<00:00:59.940> went<00:01:00.090> down<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> hole<00:01:00.980> real<00:01:01.980> simple

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that went down to that hole real simple

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
that went down to that hole real simple
to<00:01:02.609> take<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.239> once<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.559> hard

part is getting added you have to take
the<00:01:06.240> entire<00:01:06.470> top<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> truck<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the entire top of the truck off the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.609 
the entire top of the truck off the
entire<00:01:08.990> bed<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.159> our<00:01:11.280> case<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.820> used

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
entire bed off and in our case that used

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
entire bed off and in our case that used
18<00:01:13.619> millimeter<00:01:14.100> bolts<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:14.970> were<00:01:15.210> eight

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
18 millimeter bolts and there were eight

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
18 millimeter bolts and there were eight
of<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:16.170> four<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.590> each<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.640> see

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of them four on each side you can see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
of them four on each side you can see
where<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.060> bolt<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.979> main

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
where they bolt in down here on the main

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.310 
where they bolt in down here on the main
chassis<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.900> bolts

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
chassis so there that's two bolts

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
chassis so there that's two bolts
holders<00:01:23.100> there's<00:01:23.340> another<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:24.000> there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
holders there's another two down there

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.780 
holders there's another two down there
and<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.659> thing<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.080> side<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.790> we

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and the same thing on this side and we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
and the same thing on this side and we
also<00:01:26.820> had<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.390> disconnect<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.439> gas<00:01:30.350> tank

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
also had to disconnect the gas tank

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.410 
also had to disconnect the gas tank
feeder<00:01:31.619> line<00:01:32.090> from<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> side<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
feeder line from the side of that and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
feeder line from the side of that and
other<00:01:36.420> than<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.570> once<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.189> got<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.400> more

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
other than that once we got to have more

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
other than that once we got to have more
than<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:39.479> person<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.110> blocks<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.070> work<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
than one person or blocks to work it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.609 
than one person or blocks to work it
around<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.970> once<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.409> easy

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
around but once we got it back it's easy

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.980 
around but once we got it back it's easy
to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> gas<00:01:44.310> tank<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.210> right

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.620 

not<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.110> much<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.620> could<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:54.030> simply<00:01:54.420> take

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
not as much as we could you simply take

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
not as much as we could you simply take
these<00:01:54.870> three<00:01:55.260> lines<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.370> there<00:01:56.970> are<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
these three lines right here there are a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
these three lines right here there are a
quick<00:01:57.720> release<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.710> push<00:01:59.040> down<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.310> them

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
quick release and you push down on them

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
quick release and you push down on them
right<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.720> see<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> quick

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
right here you can see the quick

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.670 
right here you can see the quick
releases<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:03.360> push<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.960> those<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
releases and you push down on those and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.109 
releases and you push down on those and
that<00:02:04.860> releases<00:02:05.220> each<00:02:05.550> one<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:05.910> lines

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that releases each one of these lines

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
that releases each one of these lines
one<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.600> time<00:02:06.810> I'm<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> transfer

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
one at a time I'm going to transfer

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.790 
one at a time I'm going to transfer
those<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.280> guess<00:02:08.459> over<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.880> new<00:02:09.090> piece

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
those I guess over to this new piece

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
those I guess over to this new piece
when<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:10.950> ready<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.820> will<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.060> taking<00:02:12.360> this

fuel tank I also have to put this on so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.540 
fuel tank I also have to put this on so
if<00:02:19.020> yours<00:02:19.230> doesn't<00:02:19.560> come<00:02:19.680> attached<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.370> just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
if yours doesn't come attached you just

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.120 
if yours doesn't come attached you just
attach<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.260> right<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.410> through<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
attach it in right in through there and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.949 
attach it in right in through there and
run<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.820> bar<00:02:24.090> up<00:02:24.209> through<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
run the bar up through there and it

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.600 
run the bar up through there and it
should<00:02:25.200> look<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.100> when<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.459> up

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
should look just like that when it's up

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.720 
should look just like that when it's up
and<00:02:26.760> running<00:02:26.820> so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.860 

and<00:02:35.730> talk<00:02:36.030> about<00:02:36.060> gas

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.809 

which<00:02:41.349> here<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.860> old<00:02:41.980> unit<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.580> see

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
which here on the old unit you can see

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.729 
which here on the old unit you can see
the<00:02:42.970> gasket<00:02:43.180> here<00:02:43.599> comes<00:02:43.900> right<00:02:44.140> off<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
the gasket here comes right off and you

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.430 
the gasket here comes right off and you
will<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.129> two<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.510> new<00:02:46.629> unit<00:02:47.019> simply

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
will have two on the new unit simply

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.020 
will have two on the new unit simply
slide<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.890> back<00:02:48.040> up<00:02:48.250> into<00:02:48.400> place<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
slide that back up into place so it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.240 
slide that back up into place so it
looks<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:49.569> like<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.860> that's<00:02:51.040> already

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
looks just like that so that's already

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.309 
looks just like that so that's already
done<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.819> just<00:02:51.849> took<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> unit<00:02:52.690> carefully

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
done I just took the unit carefully

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.830 
done I just took the unit carefully
worked<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.129> there<00:02:54.430> set<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.180> down<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.690> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
worked it in there set it down as you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.780 
worked it in there set it down as you
can<00:02:55.930> see<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.440> guess<00:02:56.769> these<00:02:57.010> probably<00:02:57.489> go<00:02:57.640> in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
can see I guess these probably go in

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.339 
can see I guess these probably go in
several<00:02:58.120> different<00:02:58.239> types<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.660> gas<00:02:58.840> tanks<00:02:59.230> so

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
several different types of gas tanks so

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.869 
several different types of gas tanks so
it's<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> little<00:02:59.709> taller<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.310> that's<00:03:00.519> why<00:03:00.670> it's

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
it's a little taller but that's why it's

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.360 
it's a little taller but that's why it's
you'll<00:03:01.780> notice<00:03:02.080> they're<00:03:02.260> spring-loaded<00:03:02.620> so

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
you'll notice they're spring-loaded so

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.839 
you'll notice they're spring-loaded so
they<00:03:03.549> drop<00:03:03.819> up<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.209> down<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:06.459> is<00:03:06.640> the

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
they drop up and down so this is the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.850 
they drop up and down so this is the
retaining<00:03:07.510> clip<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.110> guess<00:03:08.319> for<00:03:08.530> lack<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
retaining clip I guess for lack of a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.410 
retaining clip I guess for lack of a
better<00:03:08.890> word<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:09.459> going<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.790> take<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.390> I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
better word I'm going to take this and I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.000 
better word I'm going to take this and I
will<00:03:10.569> be<00:03:10.690> popping<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.290> carefully<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.310> here

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
will be popping it carefully in here

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.440 
will be popping it carefully in here
okay<00:03:15.010> well<00:03:15.190> after<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.489> little<00:03:15.610> bit<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.819> grief<00:03:16.180> I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
okay well after a little bit of grief I

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.089 
okay well after a little bit of grief I
managed<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.200> unit<00:03:17.470> pushed<00:03:17.680> down<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
managed to get the unit pushed down you

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.650 
managed to get the unit pushed down you
kind<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.519> work<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.970> gasket<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
kind of have to work the gasket in a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.000 
kind of have to work the gasket in a
little<00:03:19.870> bit<00:03:19.959> around<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.680> want<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.890> make

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
little bit around and you want to make

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.000 
little bit around and you want to make
sure<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:22.510> guess<00:03:23.200> we<00:03:23.560> call<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.920> a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
sure this little I guess we call it a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.339 
sure this little I guess we call it a
tooth<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.819> guide<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.329> has<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.810> line<00:03:26.019> up<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
tooth to guide it in has to line up to

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.710 
tooth to guide it in has to line up to
come<00:03:26.500> back<00:03:26.680> into<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.190> base<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.090> gas<00:03:28.450> tank

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
come back into the base of a gas tank

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.979 
come back into the base of a gas tank
here<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> now<00:03:30.220> had<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.610> flush<00:03:31.030> where<00:03:31.930> it

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
here so I now had it flush where it

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.229 
here so I now had it flush where it
needs<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.410> lined<00:03:32.799> up<00:03:33.040> now<00:03:33.910> I'm<00:03:34.060> going<00:03:34.180> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
screwdriver and a hammer the same way we

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220 
screwdriver and a hammer the same way we
took<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.519> off<00:04:03.670> just<00:04:04.060> vice-versa<00:04:04.660> needed

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.710 
that so you do that three times it's
middle<00:05:18.910> ones<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.150> little<00:05:19.360> different<00:05:19.690> you

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
middle ones a little different you

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.590 
middle ones a little different you

actually Tinch it on both sides at the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.880 
actually Tinch it on both sides at the
same<00:05:22.660> time<00:05:23.170> and<00:05:23.500> then<00:05:24.160> slide<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.730> over<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.890> lip

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
here okay so what I ended up how to do

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.240 
here okay so what I ended up how to do
here<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.970> way<00:05:31.090> this<00:05:31.270> unit<00:05:31.570> came<00:05:31.810> is<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.290> the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
here the way this unit came is the the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.210 
here the way this unit came is the the
old<00:05:33.550> adapter<00:05:34.740> whatever<00:05:35.740> reason<00:05:36.070> they've

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
old adapter whatever reason they've

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.280 
old adapter whatever reason they've
switched<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.820> different<00:05:36.910> one<00:05:37.390> so<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.900> had<00:05:38.170> to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
switched to a different one so I had to

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.100 
switched to a different one so I had to
cut<00:05:38.500> this<00:05:38.680> one<00:05:38.890> off<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.720> take<00:05:40.720> all<00:05:40.900> these<00:05:41.050> and

cut this one off and take all these and
splice<00:05:41.530> them<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.920> using<00:05:42.460> clamps<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.210> came

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420
