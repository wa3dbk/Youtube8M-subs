00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.680
 in the second game of group b 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.759
 already in the first 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 it looks like that 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.870
 the CeBIT offer both teams because 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.870
 Eicher Ramirez 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 important the TweetDeck 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 her own some 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 3 presents a gift 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.160
 with a good defense on 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
 and who just at ten 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.290
 should be played 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 that means more 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.780
 now still far meadow next door 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.680
 Gabriele violence 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 and there is the next corner he so before 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 Martin Harnik 1 slightly injured 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 so it seems in the Dow no changed 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.700
 Harnik replaced 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 Heribert Werr gave 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 Of course that is not Sharia law 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 but that stela somewhere else 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 Dreieich surprised but by a nice evening 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.709
 Ivanschitz 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:12.779
 with the shot broke 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.779
 and he is still strong 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.189
 Ole Maschaie to deep sleep after the 5 2 1 against the German team 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.429
 the German team before the AG 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.899
 just under two hours 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.109
 2 pm against 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.919
 Martin want to win 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
 great victory and construction 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
 this is IT Resources 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.749
 to run a little better for the Austrians 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.429
 with the arrangement in Innsbruck 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.429
 But now as I said 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 already on the left side Ebert Berg 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.069
 so the SG Obwalden read her here 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 it is good that here 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.239
 the former no 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 and how do you do that too 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 Left corner free but he 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840
 Budai had gone too far 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.330
 for the austrians 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 because there are the voices 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:59.240
 The national team 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 maybe also a success 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.639
 but that's all 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.189
 the Berlin market 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.589
 continue over the corner 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:43.619
 it looks good and the Poles enjoy fishing 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:46.619
 or doubted 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.550
 Anette way again 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.610
 Matthias Lehmann 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.610
 Florian Stücker brought 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.869
 Picture Sven Black was 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.330
 the animal rights activists 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.210
 we at least the eni shares park-like he sits on the bench though 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.740
 Poland's best 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.059
 should be brought 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.300
 that is then as I said made two major mistakes 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.599
 but my team 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.599
 what brings your eyes Vienna 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.939
 because most players of the Austrian national team yes 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.939
 are under contract in their own country 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.159
 the band just not the last one about Panathinaikos Athens 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.729
 But it was a mistake for both of us 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.729
 Fuchsstadt self-employment 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.309
 and a minute at 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.930
 And if you keep it otherwise in the ground Robert Walser too "I am also an impulse 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.930
 ready 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.719
 downstairs it was a room 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.719
 Küster knows a well-deserved result 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.979
 Matthias Finger from the host 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:36.409
 finally certainty
