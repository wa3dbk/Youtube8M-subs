cross<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.190> which<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
cross in which we all know as the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.240 
cross in which we all know as the
pedestrian<00:00:18.359> gates

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
pedestrian gates

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
pedestrian gates
now<00:00:20.250> I'm<00:00:20.670> thinking<00:00:20.730> putting<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.630> electric

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
now I'm thinking putting in electric

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.050 
now I'm thinking putting in electric
railroad<00:00:22.680> crossing<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.640> your

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
railroad crossing but I want your

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.689 
railroad crossing but I want your
opinion<00:00:24.600> I'm<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> build<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> electric

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
opinion I'm going to build the electric

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.349 
opinion I'm going to build the electric
railroad<00:00:27.269> crossing<00:00:27.980> well<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:30.210> mean

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
railroad crossing well now I don't mean

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.049 
railroad crossing well now I don't mean
like<00:00:30.510> electric<00:00:31.109> by<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.160> sa<00:00:32.550> XR<00:00:32.880> Keys

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
like electric by me like with sa XR Keys

like electric by me like with sa XR Keys
railroad<00:00:33.480> crossings<00:00:34.430> now<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:36.590> am<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> use

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
railroad crossings now I am going to use

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
railroad crossings now I am going to use
them<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.579> left<00:00:38.790> repel<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
them with you left repel so it's kind of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
them with you left repel so it's kind of
like<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.050> new<00:00:40.260> ones<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> building

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
like the new ones I'm kind of building

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
like the new ones I'm kind of building
the<00:00:41.940> new<00:00:42.030> ones<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.500> opinion<00:00:43.710> if

I've gotten this routed to Wisconsin so
I'm<00:01:22.860> making<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:23.939> good<00:01:24.060> progress

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.390 

and<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.330> have<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> trained<00:01:30.930> Colleen<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and we do have a trained Colleen just to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980 
and we do have a trained Colleen just to
show<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.730> a<00:01:32.850> video<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.510> after<00:01:33.690> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
show you a video and then after this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
show you a video and then after this
video<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.530> show<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.830> video<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> old

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
video I will show you a video of the old

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
video I will show you a video of the old
river<00:01:35.790> crossing<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.660> I<00:01:36.690> have<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.500> then

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
river crossing that I have and then

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.560 
river crossing that I have and then
basically<00:01:38.970> shown<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> previous<00:01:39.870> videos<00:01:41.570> and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
basically shown in previous videos and

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
basically shown in previous videos and
that's<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.260> using<00:01:46.790> that's<00:01:47.790> mean

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that's what I will be using that's mean

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's what I will be using that's mean
these<00:01:48.660> two<00:01:48.930> arrow<00:01:49.110> crossings<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.710> 9th<00:01:49.920> Street

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these two arrow crossings at 9th Street

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
these two arrow crossings at 9th Street
workshop<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> two<00:01:50.970> most<00:01:51.150> important<00:01:51.690> ones<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
workshop the two most important ones I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.890 
workshop the two most important ones I
will<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.800> changing<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> others<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.570> using

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
will be changing the others to to using

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.750 
will be changing the others to to using
these<00:01:54.990> railroad<00:01:55.350> crossings<00:01:55.830> most<00:01:56.400> of<00:01:56.550> them<00:01:56.640> at

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
these railroad crossings most of them at

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.990 
these railroad crossings most of them at
least<00:01:58.730> so<00:01:59.730> yeah<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:01.410> that<00:02:02.310> train<00:02:02.640> should<00:02:02.880> be

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
least so yeah and that train should be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.060 
least so yeah and that train should be
coming<00:02:03.330> now<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.790> unless<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.150> checked<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
coming now so unless I checked and it is

00:02:08.070 --> 00:04:07.440 
coming now so unless I checked and it is
a<00:02:08.100> BNSF<00:02:08.780> intermodal

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.949 

okay<00:04:08.140> now<00:04:08.319> bomb<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:09.250> keeps<00:04:10.240> bumping<00:04:10.569> for

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
okay now bomb that keeps bumping for

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.690 
okay now bomb that keeps bumping for
some<00:04:11.140> reason<00:04:11.470> not<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.890> railroad<00:04:12.310> cross<00:04:12.520> is

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
some reason not the railroad cross is

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.089 
some reason not the railroad cross is
