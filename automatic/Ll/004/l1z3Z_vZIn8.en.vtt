 completely thick as you can see is 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.600
 very simple has no problems if 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.000
 boil or not 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.250
 it is cut like the egg that curdles already 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.600
 Once it's only turned over and we're going 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.100
 to let cool well covered in the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.110
 refrigerator to harden and what 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.320
 will come out is to be here is that I the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.360
 mind interest oil but it is very 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.430
 very spanish what the written song 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.080
 please with oil the tray people 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 that collaborates painting was not painting the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.440
 needs to 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.650
 so we will prepare what I have 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
 hot oil to be fried and 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.560
 let's make a basic batter that is 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.840
 flour and then egg 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.520
 this comes delicious we're going to put it 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.550
 here 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.020
 and in a little dish with a little paper 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.910
 absorbent we are putting all of milk 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.860
 fried to remove excess fat 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.210
 So, good, I keep telling you, there's 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.310
 get to cut the size they are looking for 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.140
 they can be big squares guys 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.700
 these little ones can use them 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.700
 to drain a few shells the little horns 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.440
 besides the smell that I'm perceiving 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.780
 here nothing more to be like this counting the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.220
 here that will end this smells very rich 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.480
 and apart especially the children who do not 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.130
 They can consume eggs today 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.410
 we have a lot of that problem can you 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.150
 do it perfectly well then 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.640
 I cut it, I'm going to pass the pieces with a 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.290
 little bit of flour and then the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.340
 egg all this tale of the courses was 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.480
 in the children's is going to be something 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.520
 wonderful because apart they have 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
 outdoor activities departed to your 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.580
 dog of water thefts and everything that I 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.950
 I think it's important that you enjoy 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.240
 surround besides confess to do things 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.220
 that are fun to the school that 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.500
 can cook etc etc always 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.660
 under the supervision of a chef and a 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.280
 adult to yemen to a chef instructor by 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.080
 every three children with them so they do not 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.080
 there is no problem that for all 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.620
 TV show has already been with me 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.490
 talking about Mesoamerica talking to 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.290
 her and it's a date that basically already 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.910
 is stretched completely with plastic 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.410
 of the kitchen can hit another point was 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.650
 butter with is hot they release it 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.210
 above and generates a capita capita 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.450
 so that it does not dry out and they can 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.450
 cut 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.210
 here and then of the cream the fried milk 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.490
 which is passed through flour I went through 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.140

 where the boys make their had 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.530
 practices in front of the client then there 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.220
 what it does is a coarse subject of a bar 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.570
 beautiful real kitchen in sight and everything 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.810

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.670
 I was having to take the class 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 all of that can be seen directly in 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.840
 the chain 2 dotcom district page and 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.550
 there you can really see the courses that 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.920
 are when they start that the cep the 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.300
 imparts et cetera because we have several 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.220

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.760
 we have since pastry we have 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.760
 oenology 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.630
 cold kitchen there is also Maghrebi cuisine 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.220
 we have everything good as you see it is already 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.080
 Very confronted milk is a fried dessert 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.670
 but completely sweet very important 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.220
 as you know of the oil that is hot 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.630
 in the fried milk we put a mixture of 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.970
 sugar and ground cinnamon in equal parts 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.590
 so that the sugar la in bbva 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.850
 good absorb what fat is 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.850
 found and chew 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.400
 then already once it is me 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.650
 I recommend that the cold seems nothing 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.500
 plus a small little big detail 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.330
 detail has three bits nothing more and 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.800
 the dish that I am using is a plate 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.930
 large enough for 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.760
 you see nothing bad being eating and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.870
 someone outside but nothing more simple 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.190
 that the presentation that you are doing 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.990
 Here, what a raul I think is something very 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.020
 simple what can the house do we are going to 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.220
 put a little sugar and cinnamon to 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.870
 decorate the plate and what it does is put 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.400
 a few leaves of mint leaves nothing more 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.170

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.630
