it I will talk with a customer about
what<00:00:29.800> kind<00:00:30.009> of<00:00:30.099> design<00:00:30.910> they're<00:00:31.270> wanting<00:00:31.779> once

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
what kind of design they're wanting once

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.810 
what kind of design they're wanting once
the<00:00:32.619> customer<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.070> I<00:00:33.100> figure<00:00:33.400> out<00:00:33.519> what<00:00:33.640> kind

of<00:00:33.850> design<00:00:34.180> we<00:00:34.360> want<00:00:34.600> or<00:00:34.900> if<00:00:35.140> I'm<00:00:35.260> building<00:00:35.470> my

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
of design we want or if I'm building my

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.979 
of design we want or if I'm building my
own<00:00:35.739> cars<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.519> design<00:00:37.269> them<00:00:37.480> myself

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
own cars and design them myself

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.180 
own cars and design them myself
we<00:00:38.500> start<00:00:39.160> by<00:00:39.570> building<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.839> block<00:00:41.080> and<00:00:41.320> so<00:00:41.890> back

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
we start by building a block and so back

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.630 
we start by building a block and so back
here<00:00:42.220> we<00:00:42.730> have<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.910> wooden<00:00:43.360> structure<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.489> way

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
here we have a wooden structure the way

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.960 
here we have a wooden structure the way
that<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:45.879> design<00:00:46.300> my<00:00:46.510> buck<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:47.519> completely<00:00:48.519> from

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
that I design my buck is completely from

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.439 
that I design my buck is completely from
scratch<00:00:49.330> using<00:00:49.960> pencil<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:51.100> start<00:00:51.970> on<00:00:52.150> paper

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
scratch using pencil I start on paper

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.250 
scratch using pencil I start on paper
and<00:00:52.869> then<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:54.129> translate<00:00:54.879> my<00:00:55.180> design<00:00:55.629> onto<00:00:55.960> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and then I translate my design onto a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.549 
and then I translate my design onto a
sheet<00:00:56.619> of<00:00:56.739> plywood<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.420> just<00:00:59.049> start

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
sheet of plywood and I just start

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.039 
sheet of plywood and I just start
cutting<00:00:59.920> piece<00:01:00.190> by<00:01:00.369> piece<00:01:00.400> I<00:01:00.970> don't<00:01:01.809> use<00:01:01.900> any

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
cutting piece by piece I don't use any

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.829 
cutting piece by piece I don't use any
computers<00:01:02.619> I<00:01:02.890> build<00:01:03.790> my<00:01:04.000> buck<00:01:04.239> typically

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
computers I build my buck typically

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.750 
computers I build my buck typically
directly<00:01:05.379> onto<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.799> chassis<00:01:06.040> that's<00:01:06.460> going

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
directly onto the chassis that's going

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.429 
directly onto the chassis that's going
to<00:01:06.850> be<00:01:06.939> used<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.930> rolling<00:01:08.260> chassis

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
to be used so I have the rolling chassis

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.260 
to be used so I have the rolling chassis
here<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.070> wheels<00:01:09.250> tires<00:01:09.580> everything<00:01:10.180> in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
here the wheels tires everything in

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.859 
here the wheels tires everything in
place<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.750> then<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.850> wooden<00:01:12.850> buck<00:01:13.630> is

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
place and then the wooden buck is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.920 
place and then the wooden buck is
designed<00:01:14.380> wrapped<00:01:15.189> right<00:01:15.490> around<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.119> the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
designed wrapped right around that the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.260 
designed wrapped right around that the
next<00:01:17.200> step<00:01:17.409> is<00:01:17.439> taking<00:01:18.159> sheet<00:01:18.460> aluminum<00:01:19.030> like

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
next step is taking sheet aluminum like

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.600 
next step is taking sheet aluminum like
what<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.540> see<00:01:19.720> over<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.610> making

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
what you see over here and making

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.630 
what you see over here and making
patterns<00:01:22.210> off<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.170> buck<00:01:23.350> laying<00:01:24.310> them<00:01:24.550> out

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
patterns off of the buck laying them out

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.270 
patterns off of the buck laying them out
on<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.090> sheet<00:01:25.270> aluminum<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.990> then<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:26.860> take<00:01:27.250> a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
on the sheet aluminum and then I take a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.130 
on the sheet aluminum and then I take a
flat<00:01:27.580> sheet<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.970> aluminum<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.540> just<00:01:28.810> start

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
flat sheet of aluminum and just start

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.140 
flat sheet of aluminum and just start
start<00:01:29.890> shaping<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.340> over<00:01:30.640> tree<00:01:30.850> stove's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
start shaping it over tree stove's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.610 
start shaping it over tree stove's
shaping<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.050> over<00:01:32.260> my<00:01:32.409> knee<00:01:33.060> hammers

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
shaping it over my knee hammers

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.290 
shaping it over my knee hammers
every<00:01:35.620> once<00:01:35.800> in<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.980> while<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.430> design<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.060> car

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
every once in a while to design a car

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.490 
every once in a while to design a car
without<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.600> bucket<00:01:37.870> I'll<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.290> do<00:01:38.470> it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
without a bucket I'll just do it

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.420 
without a bucket I'll just do it
straight<00:01:39.100> from<00:01:39.610> scratch<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.960> car<00:01:41.320> was<00:01:42.220> built

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
straight from scratch this car was built

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.310 
straight from scratch this car was built
in<00:01:42.790> three<00:01:43.690> sections

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
in three sections

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.590 
in three sections
I<00:01:44.440> built<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.159> way<00:01:45.370> so<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:45.670> if<00:01:46.210> you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
I built it this way so that if you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.180 
I built it this way so that if you
wanted<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.020> remove<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.440> front<00:01:47.680> clip<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.100> can

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
wanted to remove the front clip you can

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.920 
wanted to remove the front clip you can
do<00:01:48.370> that<00:01:48.580> we<00:01:48.729> can<00:01:48.880> remove<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.360> entire<00:01:49.600> front

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
do that we can remove the entire front

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.750 
do that we can remove the entire front
clip<00:01:50.110> on<00:01:50.290> this<00:01:50.409> car<00:01:50.650> if<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.280> want<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.550> remove

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
prototype is the very first one I ever

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.809 
prototype is the very first one I ever
built<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.989> was<00:02:11.200> built<00:02:11.890> obviously<00:02:12.099> right<00:02:12.670> off

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
built it was built obviously right off

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.089 
built it was built obviously right off
of<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.120> buck<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.140> saw<00:02:14.319> over<00:02:14.349> there<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
of the buck that you saw over there and

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.100 
of the buck that you saw over there and
then<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:15.849> being<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.269> prototype<00:02:16.720> I've<00:02:16.930> done<00:02:17.080> a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
then this being a prototype I've done a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.229 
then this being a prototype I've done a
lot<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.349> things<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.890> over<00:02:18.069> time<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.580> made<00:02:19.299> the

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
lot of things to it over time I made the

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.630 
lot of things to it over time I made the
the<00:02:20.510> removable<00:02:20.959> cockpit<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.219> have

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the removable cockpit so you can have

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.020 
the removable cockpit so you can have
this<00:02:22.909> car<00:02:23.239> as<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:24.200> roadster<00:02:24.709> with<00:02:25.549> just<00:02:25.909> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
this car as a roadster with just a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.000 
this car as a roadster with just a
little<00:02:26.269> short<00:02:26.569> competition<00:02:27.319> windscreen<00:02:27.799> or

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
little short competition windscreen or

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.190 
little short competition windscreen or
you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.700> run<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> coupe<00:02:29.870> with<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
you can run it as a coupe with the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880 
you can run it as a coupe with the
aluminum<00:02:30.980> top<00:02:31.189> on<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:32.409> it's<00:02:33.409> pretty<00:02:33.590> fun

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
aluminum top on it and it's pretty fun

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.520 
aluminum top on it and it's pretty fun
the<00:02:34.099> coupe<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.900> gives<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.319> car

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
the coupe really just gives the car

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.699 
the coupe really just gives the car
totally<00:02:37.099> different<00:02:37.489> lines<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:39.349> kind<00:02:39.620> of

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
totally different lines and it's kind of

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.640 
totally different lines and it's kind of
an<00:02:39.799> evolution<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.629> new<00:02:41.989> project<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.560> I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
an evolution of the new project that I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.009 
an evolution of the new project that I
have<00:02:42.859> coming<00:02:43.129> up<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.579> Avis<00:02:44.239> prototype<00:02:44.810> that

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
have coming up that Avis prototype that

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.860 
have coming up that Avis prototype that
I'm<00:02:45.139> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.379> build<00:02:46.030> which<00:02:47.030> will<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.359> fixed

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
I'm going to build which will be a fixed

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.539 
I'm going to build which will be a fixed
coupe<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.709> will<00:02:48.859> not<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.219> a<00:02:49.250> removable

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
coupe so it will not have a removable

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.580 
coupe so it will not have a removable
shell<00:02:50.150> at<00:02:50.299> all<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.599> will<00:02:50.719> be<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> solid<00:02:51.200> true

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
shell at all it will be a solid true

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.960 
shell at all it will be a solid true
proof<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.659> this<00:02:53.659> car<00:02:53.989> has<00:02:54.439> also<00:02:54.970> Volkswagen

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
proof and this car has also Volkswagen

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.589 
proof and this car has also Volkswagen
and<00:02:56.180> Porsche<00:02:56.989> components<00:02:57.680> underneath<00:02:58.010> it

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
and Porsche components underneath it

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.530 
and Porsche components underneath it
it's<00:02:59.599> obviously<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.079> single-seat<00:03:00.590> car<00:03:00.889> so<00:03:01.669> it's

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
it's obviously a single-seat car so it's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.580 
it's obviously a single-seat car so it's
really<00:03:03.230> fun<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.439> drive<00:03:03.739> on<00:03:04.250> your<00:03:04.629> set<00:03:05.629> position

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
really fun to drive on your set position

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.250 
really fun to drive on your set position
right<00:03:06.889> in<00:03:06.919> the<00:03:07.340> center<00:03:07.969> of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.750> chassis<00:03:09.019> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
right in the center of the chassis and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.280 
right in the center of the chassis and
everything<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:09.980> car<00:03:10.219> is<00:03:10.459> within<00:03:11.030> 1%<00:03:11.450> weight

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
everything this car is within 1% weight

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.080 
everything this car is within 1% weight
distribution<00:03:12.980> at<00:03:13.129> each<00:03:13.340> wheel<00:03:13.609> so<00:03:13.939> it's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
distribution at each wheel so it's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.059 
distribution at each wheel so it's
almost<00:03:14.299> complete<00:03:14.719> almost<00:03:15.439> perfectly

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
almost complete almost perfectly

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.780 
almost complete almost perfectly

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
balanced
that<00:03:17.359> kind<00:03:17.599> of<00:03:17.689> gives<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> look<00:03:18.139> at<00:03:18.319> how<00:03:18.530> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that kind of gives you a look at how the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.240 
that kind of gives you a look at how the
process<00:03:18.919> goes<00:03:19.219> for<00:03:19.790> for<00:03:20.540> me<00:03:20.750> shaking<00:03:21.409> a<00:03:21.620> body

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
process goes for for me shaking a body

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.569 
process goes for for me shaking a body
over<00:03:22.790> one<00:03:22.969> of<00:03:23.090> these<00:03:23.180> chassis<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.620> over<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
over one of these chassis so over the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.339 
over one of these chassis so over the
years<00:03:25.819> our<00:03:26.060> barns<00:03:26.510> have<00:03:26.659> been<00:03:26.750> used<00:03:26.959> for<00:03:27.169> a<00:03:27.199> lot
