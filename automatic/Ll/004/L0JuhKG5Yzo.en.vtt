and I

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.660 
and I
don't<00:03:00.170> think<00:03:00.320> I'll<00:03:00.500> ever<00:03:00.650> play<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.340> team

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
don't think I'll ever play on a team

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.930 
don't think I'll ever play on a team
like<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.140> that's<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.500> special<00:03:03.920> part<00:03:04.130> I'll

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
like that so that's a special part I'll

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220 
like that so that's a special part I'll
never<00:03:05.120> probably<00:03:05.540> be<00:03:05.630> anything<00:03:05.840> like<00:03:06.170> that

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
never probably be anything like that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.990

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I think we've been through so much but

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.910 
I think we've been through so much but
to<00:03:10.520> finally<00:03:11.030> win

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920

we were all best friends and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.809 
we were all best friends and
it<00:03:18.530> was<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:18.770> such<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:18.980> special<00:03:19.280> moment<00:03:19.580> for

to play the national team but I never

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.000 
to play the national team but I never

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
knew the process that I don't have to go

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.980 
knew the process that I don't have to go
with<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.220> order<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.550> get<00:03:25.700> there<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.660> she<00:03:26.870> was

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
with in order to get there so as she was

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.860 
with in order to get there so as she was
saying<00:03:27.260> ODP<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> mean<00:03:28.340> I'm<00:03:28.880> from<00:03:29.180> Kalamazoo<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
saying ODP I mean I'm from Kalamazoo and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.440 
saying ODP I mean I'm from Kalamazoo and
to<00:03:30.709> be<00:03:30.830> honest<00:03:31.069> we<00:03:31.700> didn't<00:03:31.910> really<00:03:32.060> know<00:03:32.270> much

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
to be honest we didn't really know much

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.800 
to be honest we didn't really know much
about<00:03:32.510> ODP<00:03:33.200> at<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.470> time<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:35.690> i<00:03:35.720> think

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
about ODP at that time and so i think

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.020 
about ODP at that time and so i think
that<00:03:36.020> i<00:03:36.140> think<00:03:36.260> on<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.890> same<00:03:37.070> lines<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.610> we

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
that i think on the same lines is we

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.520 
that i think on the same lines is we
just<00:03:38.180> kind<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.540> enjoy<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.990> journey<00:03:39.140> together
