00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
because really anything with a plan was

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
because really anything with a plan was
just<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:32.730> too<00:00:32.759> expensive<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.600> even<00:00:33.840> think

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
charges and stuff with plans so just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
charges and stuff with plans so just
prepaid<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.590> best<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.280> phone

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
prepaid is the best way to go phone
itself<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.809> expensive<00:00:46.170> than<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
itself was a bit more expensive than I

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
itself was a bit more expensive than I
wanted<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.960> super

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wanted it to be but it's super

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
wanted it to be but it's super
convenient<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> guess<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.030> worth<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
convenient so I guess it was worth it is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.029 
convenient so I guess it was worth it is
