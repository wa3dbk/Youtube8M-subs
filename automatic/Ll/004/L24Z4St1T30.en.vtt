something<00:01:06.409> for<00:01:06.530> 5.1<00:01:06.920> most<00:01:07.189> likely<00:01:07.549> it'll<00:01:07.759> be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
something for 5.1 most likely it'll be

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.830 
something for 5.1 most likely it'll be
he'll<00:01:08.450> then<00:01:08.719> continue<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.200> work<00:01:09.350> on<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.840> new

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
he'll then continue to work on the new

he'll then continue to work on the new
software<00:01:12.520> that's<00:01:13.520> what<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.670> was<00:01:13.789> assuming<00:01:13.969> he

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
software that's what I was assuming he

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.459 
software that's what I was assuming he
would<00:01:14.210> do<00:01:14.360> i'm<00:01:14.509> not<00:01:14.630> positive<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.079> that<00:01:15.170> just

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
would do i'm not positive on that just

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:16.719 
would do i'm not positive on that just
saying<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.890> he<00:01:16.130> gives<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.340> short<00:01:16.549> explanation

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
saying and he gives a short explanation

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.120 
saying and he gives a short explanation
is<00:01:17.210> why<00:01:17.359> it<00:01:17.420> might<00:01:17.600> be<00:01:17.750> at<00:01:17.869> lon<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.320> i<00:01:18.619> feel<00:01:18.859> he

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
is why it might be at lon and i feel he

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.950 
is why it might be at lon and i feel he
shouldn't<00:01:19.369> have<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.670> explain<00:01:19.759> himself<00:01:20.090> he's

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
shouldn't have to explain himself he's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.420 
shouldn't have to explain himself he's

seems to have some problems and it seems

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.509 
seems to have some problems and it seems
very<00:02:29.780> difficult<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.469> managed<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.099> do<00:02:31.189> it<00:02:31.219> once

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
very difficult I managed to do it once

but after that I try to do it again and
I<00:02:33.439> couldn't<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:33.829> so<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.620> seems<00:02:36.799> like

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
