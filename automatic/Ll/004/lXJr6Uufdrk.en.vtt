articulation<00:02:28.950> Baxter<00:02:29.459> Stockman's<00:02:29.909> head<00:02:30.090> does

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
articulation Baxter Stockman's head does

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.970 
articulation Baxter Stockman's head does
move<00:02:31.440> left<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.829> right<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.870> could<00:02:34.319> fully

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
move left to right it it could fully

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.710 
move left to right it it could fully
rotate<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> would<00:02:36.299> be<00:02:36.450> little

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
rotate but you know it would be little

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.600 
rotate but you know it would be little
hard<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.049> don't<00:02:37.260> fully<00:02:37.470> recommend<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.129> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
hard so I don't fully recommend it the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.809 
hard so I don't fully recommend it the
arms<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.379> go<00:02:40.379> forward<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.769> back<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.670> out

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
arms to go forward and back in and out

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.729 
arms to go forward and back in and out
they've<00:02:42.659> been<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.079> elbow<00:02:43.319> pretty<00:02:43.560> nice

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
they've been at the elbow pretty nice

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.030 
they've been at the elbow pretty nice
elbow<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.519> full<00:02:45.060> 90-degree<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.410> wrist<00:02:46.829> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
elbow on full 90-degree the wrist you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.849 
elbow on full 90-degree the wrist you
rotate<00:02:47.370> which<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.609> do<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.329> fingers<00:02:48.859> don't

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
rotate which I do like the fingers don't

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.830 
rotate which I do like the fingers don't
move<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.879> are<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.450> kind<00:02:51.750> of

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
move but they are on this kind of

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.259 
move but they are on this kind of
pliable<00:02:52.170> plastic<00:02:52.319> where<00:02:52.829> they're<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
pliable plastic where they're if you

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.509 
pliable plastic where they're if you
want<00:02:54.480> him<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.870> hold<00:02:55.109> something<00:02:55.410> they<00:02:55.859> they'll

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
want him to hold something they they'll

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.460 
want him to hold something they they'll
let<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.420> know<00:02:57.540> they're<00:02:58.019> pliable

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
let you like you know they're pliable

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
let you like you know they're pliable
enough<00:02:58.549> where<00:02:59.549> they<00:02:59.730> won't<00:02:59.970> break<00:03:00.299> if<00:03:00.629> you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
enough where they won't break if you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.330 
enough where they won't break if you
move<00:03:01.049> them<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.409> that's<00:03:01.530> that's<00:03:01.859> really<00:03:02.099> good
