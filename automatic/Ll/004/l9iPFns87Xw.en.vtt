 Hello 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.850
 I'm interested in rahmon's question 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.219
 central processor 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.609
 I have 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.019
 cpu title 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 but to sense from the hem 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.799
 she is 7 thousand 400 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.739
 clocked at 2 and very 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.150
 anti-raiding 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.779
 what is my question this is how 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.810
 right 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.989
 overclock this processor 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.989
 I'll say right away that I am climbing 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.570
 standard ie boxing vaikulis 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.130
 Now I will just try 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 nothing I looked more than once 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.070
 the procession of work in the process of divorce 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.850
 follow him 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.650
 and tell me what I did that they are wrong 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.200
 what to add 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.730
 Levochkin 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.740
 What do you think 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.200
 let's get started 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 liza try 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.710
 motherboard 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.670
 and find 5 yu 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.420
 pripyat 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 Kirov ul pro 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 bribe taker 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.560
 but 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.060
 what i have 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 At the beginning of the articles, that is, the basic 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 yusch 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 system corruption 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.050
 eight 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.920
 them on the bike 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.079
 we leave 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.469
 mmmm start december 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.469
 we go 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 correspondent 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.049
 cramped despondency 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.459
 ten 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.929
 but residents 10 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.929
 and a half 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 prim 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.909
 an excellent student 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.659
 and a half 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.909
 km h how much 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.639
 that is, the account is partly native 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.639
 and we need for example on 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.289
 how much would 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.349
 more more 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.209
 half a fight 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.869
 3 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.729
 note 360 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.109
 a little bit 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.109
 so many 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 there are such 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.729
 new Year 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.929
 by half 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.929
 probably so 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.469
 highly 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 list 300 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.219
 then 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.589
 choose 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.699
 no no tons 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.529
 m 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.059
 he 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:03.679
 clean cook 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:05.709
 so why are we her in approximate too 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.239
 Kohl cows 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.369
 we think the flow of the robbers was written 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.089
 120 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.089
 she will rise 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 pcs tons 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.169
 square according to need 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.879
 and how is he day boxing me boxing smile 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.169
 I will not lift alternate 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.659
 voltage 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.659
 so I don't want ul to have time to process 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 I won't go to the front anymore 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.409
 and customizable 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.409
 percentage rotational speed 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.069
 Well, the field is configured 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.620
 was on it 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.290
 standard is no one else rub it hard 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.290
 need care summit 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.430
 that's just the same h 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.659
 yes how are you 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.659
 Dushanbe 5 10 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.319
 computer is off the main thing completely 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.650
 hook 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.650
 but it started 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.589
 look means 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.589
 Now the actress is walking stock exchanges 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
 WG look with something to the information 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.400
 but 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.639
 so-called 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.419
 and the central processor is expensive 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.240
 fourth 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.279
 third term 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.069
 four 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.069
 chip cost 2 does not move 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.819
 however 2 8 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.729
 d and more 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.159
 work frequency he 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.159
 I saw somewhere now 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.729
 in neighboring g 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.729
 please help 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.069
 that's when here 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.919
 often weakened 1326 change the world with 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.909
 dispersed on 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.309
 we are about 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.839
 50 something 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.029
 a heart 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.649
 in that it seems 1280 gadget can 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.649
 check 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:52.349
 1322 something i'm wrong and outside 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.129
 anyway 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.830
 what is the computer and see 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.520
