ghana's saw the clamshell design there's
no<00:00:13.890> hinge<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> middle<00:00:14.550> instead<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.360> just

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
no hinge in the middle instead it's just

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.080 
no hinge in the middle instead it's just
one<00:00:15.720> singular<00:00:16.230> block<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.910> name

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
one singular block and also as the name

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
one singular block and also as the name
suggests<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.779> 2ds<00:00:19.080> early<00:00:19.619> runs<00:00:19.800> games<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.220> 2d

the 2ds it's got the same features as
the<00:00:24.210> 3d<00:00:24.660> s<00:00:24.749> in<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> 3dsxl<00:00:25.349> obviously<00:00:26.039> they're

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the 3d s in the 3dsxl obviously they're

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.380 
the 3d s in the 3dsxl obviously they're
a<00:00:26.159> few<00:00:26.339> little<00:00:26.460> minor<00:00:26.669> differences<00:00:27.150> now

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
a few little minor differences now

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
a few little minor differences now
become<00:00:27.720> trailed<00:00:28.199> art<00:00:28.380> design<00:00:28.679> is<00:00:28.829> gone<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:29.220> so

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
become trailed art design is gone and so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
become trailed art design is gone and so
r<00:00:29.909> example<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.419> put<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.659> sleep<00:00:30.900> mode

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
r example to put it in sleep mode

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
r example to put it in sleep mode
there's<00:00:31.289> now<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.409> little<00:00:31.529> toggle<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.400> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there's now a little toggle here so you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.770 
there's now a little toggle here so you
can<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.610> press<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.390> screen<00:00:33.570> will<00:00:33.690> go

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
can just press that the screen will go

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.040 
can just press that the screen will go
off<00:00:33.900> put<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> back<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.190> comes<00:00:35.370> back<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
off put it back on it comes back and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.209 
off put it back on it comes back and
elsewhere<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.199> got<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> mono<00:00:37.559> speaker<00:00:37.680> but

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
elsewhere it's got a mono speaker but

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.410 
elsewhere it's got a mono speaker but
obviously<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:38.820> headphone<00:00:39.120> jack<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
obviously it's got a headphone jack so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.500 
obviously it's got a headphone jack so
that's<00:00:39.690> no<00:00:39.809> problem<00:00:40.820> also<00:00:41.820> there's<00:00:42.059> no<00:00:42.180> switch

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
that's no problem also there's no switch

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.060 
that's no problem also there's no switch
for<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> wireless<00:00:43.320> connector<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.980> can

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
for the wireless connector so it can

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459 
for the wireless connector so it can
still<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> Street<00:00:44.879> pasok<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> still<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.719> eshop

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
still do Street pasok and still do eshop

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
still do Street pasok and still do eshop
features<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.039> example<00:00:47.429> but<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
features for example but now you just

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
features for example but now you just
have<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.269> go<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> menu<00:00:48.660> press<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.199> button

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
problem it's prepared to previous 3d s

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
problem it's prepared to previous 3d s
models<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.609> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.480> 2d<00:00:54.750> s<00:00:54.839> compared<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
models and this is the 2d s compared to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
models and this is the 2d s compared to
the<00:00:55.289> original<00:00:55.350> 3ds<00:00:55.859> as<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.640> screens

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the original 3ds as you see the screens

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.329 
the original 3ds as you see the screens
are<00:00:57.149> exactly<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> same<00:00:57.570> size<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.339> battery

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
are exactly the same size and battery

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.939 
are exactly the same size and battery
life<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.719> tds<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.170> better<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> also

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
life on the tds is better and it also

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
life on the tds is better and it also
weighs<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.670> than<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
weighs a little bit more than the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.840 
weighs a little bit more than the
previous<00:01:03.210> original<00:01:04.080> 3ds<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:05.400> compared<00:01:05.730> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
previous original 3ds but compared to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.420 
previous original 3ds but compared to
the<00:01:05.940> XL<00:01:06.480> as<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.650> imagine<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> screens

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the XL as you can imagine the screens

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.830 
the XL as you can imagine the screens
are<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.759> lot<00:01:09.150> bigger<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.640> and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
are a lot bigger so there you go and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
are a lot bigger so there you go and
also<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:13.020> bet<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.290> life<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> 3ds<00:01:14.040> XL

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
also has bet about life on the 3ds XL

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.819 
also has bet about life on the 3ds XL
and<00:01:14.640> also<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.200> weighs<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.650> heavier

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
and also it weighs a little bit heavier

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.319 
and also it weighs a little bit heavier
as<00:01:16.950> well<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.030> take<00:01:18.180> into

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
as well so that's to take into

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.210 
as well so that's to take into
consideration<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> near<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.829> other<00:01:20.040> thing

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
consideration and near the other thing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
consideration and near the other thing
really<00:01:20.399> it<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> mention<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.590> important

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
really it to mention is that important

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.889 
really it to mention is that important
factor<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.399> example<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.850> 3ds<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.780> few

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
factor so for example the 3ds and a few

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.499 
factor so for example the 3ds and a few
d/s<00:01:25.049> XL<00:01:25.409> Ltd<00:01:26.130> fit<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.880> pocket<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.420> if
