release my only thing is it's far away
but<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.300> think<00:05:59.630> we<00:05:59.779> can<00:05:59.900> all<00:06:00.020> still<00:06:00.380> deal<00:06:00.710> with

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
but I think we can all still deal with

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.450 
but I think we can all still deal with
NASCAR<00:06:01.849> 14<00:06:02.389> with<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.139> NASCAR<00:06:03.620> 15<00:06:04.039> update

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
NASCAR 14 with the NASCAR 15 update

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.279 
NASCAR 14 with the NASCAR 15 update
though<00:06:04.789> we<00:06:04.909> all<00:06:05.060> know<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.330> new<00:06:05.870> Nash<00:06:06.050> cream

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
though we all know that new Nash cream

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.129 
though we all know that new Nash cream
is<00:06:06.469> coming<00:06:06.800> not<00:06:07.009> from<00:06:07.039> eutechnyx<00:06:07.699> and<00:06:08.150> it's

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
is coming not from eutechnyx and it's

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.450 
is coming not from eutechnyx and it's
something<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.590> really<00:06:09.620> be<00:06:09.889> looking<00:06:10.009> forward

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
