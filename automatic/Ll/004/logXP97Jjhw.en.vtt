00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.730
 in this with more than meter of growth 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 that has grown and we is me 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.000
 Wondering why I used to grow up? 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.650
 your lines tips and I make a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 a little bit about the other times I 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 I already let my hair grow once I 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.230
 I had my forehead cut here and she 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 it was always so short that such 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 and I will give some tips to you what 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 it works for me what to do if you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 want to let your hair grow good I 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.890
 I found it a good start, but it was 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.480
 that helps more in the time of the hair because 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 we have to stop making five goals and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.989
 led always had her hair one more 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.730
 little and I've always tried corinthians 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.200
 Turns out maybe the last thing I did 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 was to bring animals to the natural color 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 of him that was when I made an encore him 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 with tonalizante there in celso kamura and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 After that I did not do anything and it's 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 just had done californiana 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680
 people had not done anything like that just 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 popular account that discolored and stopped 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 tweak the root and try to put the hair 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.440
 blue red is another after all this 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 It helps a lot because when you do not 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 little by your hair it stops 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.330
 break then it will grow more 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.740
 fast and will get healthier 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
 beautiful and you will not be with the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.520
 accounts broken people that need 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 to cut the hair does a lot 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 The time that I cut the hair is 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 urgently needing a cut I 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.659
 take the tips here leave 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.189
 growing healthier and stronger but 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.290
 I did not cut my button points 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.030
 You did not have quadruplets so you can 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.070
 you holding so if you want to do 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.409
 hair grows have bands and chemistry 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.610
 make a weekly hydration so all 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 I make a moisturizing mask 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 when your hair with a better shampoo 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.460
 Another thing that helps is you, too. 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 always varying the shampoo is a lot 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.340
 We spoke so ah but my hair 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.530
 one year and it's called but what happens with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 hair is the following imagine you eating 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 every day, this does not make me 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 well to the body such then carrots and 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.320
 was not used but he has a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.180
 carrot-only diet for six months 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.829
 you see that your body but feels 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 lack of other proteins and other 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.100
 nutrients he will prove that he lives 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.899
 with your hair it 's the same thing when 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 you had not for a month it is like 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.020
 you had to eat broccoli by a shaft 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.909
 every day is a very common thing 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.770
 so sometimes a shine and shampoo 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.079
 Suddenly your hair super shiny but 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 He's kind of like he is, he's kind of like 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.060
 brittle 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.189
 her that you go using multiple fields 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.040
 during the week variance buyer of 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.349
 shampoos and intercalating it already adianta south 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.030
 another tip if you have oily hair and 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.860
 You want your hair to grow more than 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.530
 it was my case I used the line grows 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.569
 pmr crescendo collaborates colleague is to have a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.670
 imported credit line is written 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.620
 wrong according to our grammar but 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 The second grammar of the country is 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.090
 he is a big help in the growth of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.190
 hair if they were too much your problem is 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.859
 that the oiliness as the follicle of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.650
 hair grows it will help a lot more 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.359
 Do you have dry hair dry arraes it already? 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.040
 it will not do any good because he will 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.510
 fix a problem or there is a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 Your hair, then for me, it grows. 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.590
 theme of a tour for damn I used 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.750
 half of the fragile my hair grew 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.909
 Paulo without two months I made my 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.829
 guitar watched the line so well the line 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.170
 with this theme had a complete has 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.389
 magic has a little bar you pass by 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.819
 high school I used only the shampoo because the 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.769
 price of the rest and then added if you 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.599
 want to invest invests only in the shampoo and 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.639
 then you will buy another product or 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.319
 a whole kit too because you 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.150
 moisturizing hair here in length 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.099
 will also cause it not to break 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.690
 and appear to grow faster then 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.489
 this line is very worthwhile 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.959
 something else I did not do this year but 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.660
 I did when my fringe was with 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.329
 two of them was to use a brand new one in shampoo 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310
 My name is a cosmetic by the oxen 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.019
 horses third glittering and grow 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.760
 while I used it I felt that 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.470
 he complained and I complained about my 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.599
 hair stronger I know this is a 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.340
 very contradictory story on the internet 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.109
 A lot of people say that a lot of people work. 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.510
 says that the experience that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.949
 I had mixing in the shampoo I think 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.690
 mask is not that 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.220
 it worked yes because the dog started to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.440
 grow older than the child grows 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.629
 thicker brighter I do not know it worked 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.239
 for me but like very desperate 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.829
 try a couple of weeks you see what 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.290
 happens in your hair is the same as in 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.510
 psp has lots of people who love because it's the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.980
 Oily hair beat right or people 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.629
 that says it does not work because after 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.519
 have dry hair and really do not 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.440
 works because her problem of falling 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.889
 and a hair growth was not 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.269
 that 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.090
 another thing that helps the hair a lot 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.280

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.100

 Styling is even hair and nail I 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.310
 I think it's the yoki is the most suitable 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.470
