00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.760
What are we gonna do now?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.080
'Cause they're working for the clampdown

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.300
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.700
Because we're working for the clampdown

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.300
We will teach our twisted speech ...

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.200
... to the young ...

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.260
To the young believers

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.760
We'll train our blue-eyed men ...

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.560
... to the young ...

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.940
To the young believers

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.660
Now, the judge said five to ten,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.800
but I say double that again, I'm not ...

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.600
... working for the clampdown

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.280
No man born with a living soul can be ...

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.320
... working for the clampdown

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.040
Kick over the wall ...

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.100
... 'cause government's to fall

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.900
How can you refuse it?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.860
Let fury have the hour,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.400
anger can be power

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.400
D'you know that you can use it?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.060
The voices in your head are calling

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.780
Only a fool would think someone could save you

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.120
The men at the factory are old and cunning

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.580
You don't owe nothing,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.360
so boy get running

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
The best years of your life ...

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.160
... they want to steal

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.880
You grow up ...

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.460
... and you calm down

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.680
Working for the clampdown

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.560
You start wearing ...

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.120
... blue and brown

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.120
Working for the clampdown

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.540
So you got somebody to boss around

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720
It makes you feel a big man

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.620
You drift until you brutalize

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.120
You made your first kill now

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.140
In these days of evil presidentes

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.440
Working for the clampdown

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.340
But lately one or two ...

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.040
... has fully paid their due

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.000
For working for the clampdown

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.380
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.300
Working for the clampdown

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.620
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.520
Working for the clampdown

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.760
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.660
Working for the clampdown

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.960
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.520
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.600

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.280
Ha, gitalong, gitalong!
