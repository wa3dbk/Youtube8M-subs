with<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> variation<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
with a little bit of variation as a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.490

similar weapon you're gonna get bored

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
similar weapon you're gonna get bored
there's<00:00:52.920> no<00:00:53.100> weapons<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.180> discover<00:00:54.600> there's

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
there's no weapons to discover there's

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
there's no weapons to discover there's
not<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> trick<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.920> learning<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> use

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
not like a trick to learning how to use

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.810 
not like a trick to learning how to use
each<00:00:56.640> gun<00:00:57.059> they're<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.039> pretty<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.190> equal

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
each gun they're all pretty much equal

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
each gun they're all pretty much equal
and<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.420> fine<00:01:00.899> i<00:01:00.930> guess<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and that's fine i guess for the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.429 
and that's fine i guess for the
competitive<00:01:02.670> scene<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.120> takes<00:01:03.359> away<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.199> kind

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
competitive scene it takes away the kind

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
competitive scene it takes away the kind
of<00:01:04.559> random<00:01:05.040> variables<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> game<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of random variables in the game and it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
of random variables in the game and it
makes<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.780> one-on-one<00:01:07.350> skill<00:01:07.770> base

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
makes it more one-on-one skill base

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
makes it more one-on-one skill base
which<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> people<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.600> like

like great i unlock the 70 for you it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.249 
like great i unlock the 70 for you it
has<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> same<00:01:35.070> traits<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> mp5<00:01:36.270> which<00:01:37.020> i

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
has the same traits as the mp5 which i

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.590 
has the same traits as the mp5 which i
already<00:01:37.470> use<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.310> i<00:01:38.640> guess<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> looks

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
already use so i guess it looks

in the world right now it's awesome and
I<00:02:20.490> play<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.820> all<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> time<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.990> here's<00:02:22.770> what

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I play it all the time now here's what

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.130 
I play it all the time now here's what
it<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.640> perfect<00:02:24.150> balance<00:02:24.390> really<00:02:24.930> means

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
it in perfect balance really means

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.440 
it in perfect balance really means
instead<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.190> having<00:02:26.490> every<00:02:26.910> single<00:02:27.270> weapon

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
instead of having every single weapon

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.350 
instead of having every single weapon
being<00:02:27.960> exactly<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.770> same<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.790> are<00:02:29.940> certain

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
being exactly the same there are certain

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360 
being exactly the same there are certain
weapons<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:30.960> better<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.560> certain

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
weapons that are better and certain

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.700 
weapons that are better and certain
weapons<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:33.000> worse<00:02:33.210> than<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.110> average

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
weapons that are worse than the average

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.460 
weapons that are worse than the average
so<00:02:35.310> every<00:02:35.970> game<00:02:36.180> has<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.750> pretty<00:02:37.080> much<00:02:37.290> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
so every game has that pretty much so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.410 
so every game has that pretty much so
let's<00:02:37.650> look<00:02:37.770> at<00:02:37.950> call<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> duty<00:02:38.430> 4<00:02:38.460> i'm<00:02:39.060> using

the 70 for you this is one of the best
guns<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> game<00:02:43.110> let<00:02:43.500> alone<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.890> best<00:02:44.100> SMG

guns in the game let alone the best SMG
right<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.270> think<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.930> agree<00:02:45.960> what<00:02:46.650> are

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
playing new guns and I think the way

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.720 
playing new guns and I think the way
that<00:04:10.290> call<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.680> duty<00:04:10.980> could<00:04:11.130> solve<00:04:11.400> kind<00:04:11.640> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
that call of duty could solve kind of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.449 
that call of duty could solve kind of
this<00:04:11.880> life<00:04:12.090> great<00:04:12.630> I'm<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:13.110> my<00:04:13.140> 9th<00:04:13.560> prestige<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
this life great I'm on my 9th prestige I

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.870 
this life great I'm on my 9th prestige I
get<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.880> play<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.240> same<00:04:15.540> guns<00:04:16.130> again<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
get to play the same guns again for the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.180 
get to play the same guns again for the
ninth<00:04:18.120> time<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.780> get<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:18.989> do<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.410> again<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.130> i

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
ninth time I get to do it again and i

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.610 
ninth time I get to do it again and i
think<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> easiest<00:04:21.840> way<00:04:21.960> to<00:04:22.020> do<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.290> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
think that the easiest way to do this is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.060 
think that the easiest way to do this is
if<00:04:22.890> i<00:04:23.010> have<00:04:23.220> something<00:04:23.390> always<00:04:24.390> continue

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
if i have something always continue

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.010 
if i have something always continue
