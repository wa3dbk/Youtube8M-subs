00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.420
 I'm here with my brother, I 'm very 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 happy to participate with gospel radio 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.790

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.420
 God we are from santo domingo savio 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.759
 karpin elos a little bit above the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 holy season sunday and it's a very place 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.590
 special because it's a place where 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.680
 I came a while ago and I knew many 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329
 stories and I also fell in love with the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.220
 lives of people from their stories and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 of what is in them the fact of 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.449
 listen and the need of god and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.789
 also your company at very 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.170
 difficult to make you think big 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.170
 what it is to have those in your heart 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.800
 I am a doctor to the missions so much 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.170
 time it's that good doctor to travel and 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.810
 do everything you can do with my 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.340
 hands with my voice with everything I can 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.840
 use to talk about God's love 'that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.760
 It is basically what I do my brother 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.280
 he is a youth pastor and he is also going to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 share a little of what it is to show 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.430
 the love of God 'with what there is without 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.229
 import you do not have to put limits of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.250
 time or that I do not have this or that 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.170
 is what is there 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.030
 yes to complement what my sister 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.370
 he says there's a need to provide love 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 I left your highlights of most things 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.360
 what he emphasized the most is the fact that he 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.060
 transcended the appearance of people 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.979
 and understood that beyond what they did 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.950
 of the sins of the errors there is a 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.240
 wounded heart there is a motivation 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 wrong and I think that's the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 called that song and that god we 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.970
 does is transcend a little bit more and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.660
 see beyond and see the heart and 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.660
 worry about that 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.130
 love is a song that obviously 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.190
 the word is born in the heart of God 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.770
 says that God is love and it is like his 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.410
 definition he is love has many 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 attributes but love is as if your 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.140
 essence then I was thinking about that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.150
 Europe usually say well to him is all love 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.740
 and me that I kept thinking about one of the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.320
 occasions when my dad said that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.630
 as he is all love when he is everything 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.030
 love there is no fear there is not all 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.100
 fractionated half love is judging me 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.140
 avenger or not but even his trial 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.120
 is subject to love then like him 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 is all love anything that can 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680
 pass anything that I can go 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.300
 to him to ask him in his love and in his 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.040
 will he be the best for me 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.600
 so that's not what I want 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.220
 many times but as he is all love 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 I can rest in that and that's what 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.910
 that I want to communicate to people 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.370
 by means of this song that he is everything 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.980
 love that he wants to rescue us 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 He wants to save us and if he has given us 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.360
 so many things just because it's love that's 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.799
 the reason why he loves us so much this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.190
 boy 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.760
 43 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.760

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:13.780

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:20.010
 for you are all sad for my being and now 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 I know he will never leave me anything 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:35.370
 you gave me your peace because you are all love if 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:38.610
 I deserve it because you are you and my prayer 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.890
 will always respond 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.710

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.340

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:14.420
