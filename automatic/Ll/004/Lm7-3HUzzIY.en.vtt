66<00:00:34.800> ARS<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.879> very<00:00:35.999> free<00:00:36.359> blowing<00:00:36.749> and

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
66 ARS it's still very free blowing and

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.479 
66 ARS it's still very free blowing and
fat<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.499> don't<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.280> really

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
fat I don't think it's really

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
fat I don't think it's really
directional<00:00:38.999> it<00:00:39.089> kind<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.269> has<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.449> big<00:00:39.690> bottom

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
directional it kind of has a big bottom

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
directional it kind of has a big bottom
end<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.499> has<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.739> expansive<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.609> of<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
end and it has an expansive kind of to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
end and it has an expansive kind of to
it<00:00:42.749> the<00:00:43.320> way<00:00:43.409> that<00:00:43.440> silver<00:00:44.010> works<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.429> think<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it the way that silver works I think is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.419 
it the way that silver works I think is
it's<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:46.019> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> rigid<00:00:46.499> sound<00:00:46.949> like<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
it's more of a rigid sound like it's

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.919 
it's more of a rigid sound like it's
less<00:00:47.609> flexible<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> felt<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.899> about

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
less flexible and I felt that way about

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.380 
less flexible and I felt that way about
vintage<00:00:49.409> silver<00:00:50.159> horns<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> modern<00:00:50.940> ones<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
vintage silver horns and modern ones and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049 
vintage silver horns and modern ones and
so<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.679> the<00:00:52.920> sound<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.370> silver<00:00:53.789> if

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so if you like the sound of silver if

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.189 
so if you like the sound of silver if
that<00:00:54.239> appeals<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.659> you<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:54.929> it's<00:00:55.079> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that appeals to you then it's really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
that appeals to you then it's really
locked<00:00:55.499> in<00:00:55.679> it's<00:00:55.949> probably<00:00:56.039> exactly<00:00:56.609> what<00:00:56.729> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
locked in it's probably exactly what you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
locked in it's probably exactly what you
want<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.620> want<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
want but if you if you want to have the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.919 
want but if you if you want to have the
flexibility<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.579> move<00:00:59.760> around<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.899> all

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
flexibility to move around and do all

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.739 
flexibility to move around and do all
sorts<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.379> crazy<00:01:01.530> things<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:03.359> change<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
sorts of crazy things and change the

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.180 
sorts of crazy things and change the
tone<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.790> buy<00:01:05.790> something<00:01:06.090> else
