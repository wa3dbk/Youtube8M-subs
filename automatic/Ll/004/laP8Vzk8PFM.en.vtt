 professional extreme climbers and skiers 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.229
 the native South Tyrolean role as the sixth child of a mountain farming family 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.989
 born already in his early teens began to live in the mountains of his nearer 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.750
 Environment to climb 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 Overall, Hans Kammerlander 000 was home 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 as a student of risen together with Reinhold Messner 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.230
 Dr. Berlin every understanding 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.780
 Kids just easy 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.610
 I am 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.010
 and allowed the five points down 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.960
 I want to emphasize 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 not that one 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.220
 For ten years Hans Kammerlander held the record for the fastest 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 Climbing the highest mountain in the world 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 the Mount Everest 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.900
 he did not particularly like me that it was here with me either 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 Hans Kammerlander 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.450
 that gave the Cameroonian lost 4 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.049
 Here you can explain to me something is so fascinating at work 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.780
 you of course 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.670
 not only the movement Pascal Kainz on various points 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.190
 plays the wonderful nature 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.810
 and of course 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.060
 the tension is always 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.329
 Air under her feet all together what makes me this 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.380
 this sport too interesting 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.430
 if we now see Canaries posts 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.090
 Ott Reinhold Messner with the resident Arndt Achttausender they are important 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.630
 he also has very nice that he speaks to the system instinct 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.360
 because not everyone has something on the other side then Reinert 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.210
 Messer so fascinated 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.550
 Of course, here a very crucial person expects me to do it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.729
 the door to the new b 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.369
 makes the prelude 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.529
 and if you are fascinated then 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.309
 his tactics on the mountain 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.240
 At the right moment students go off 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.570
 but even in light moments it did not fit quickly 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.589
 Budenheim Franconia now lacked to learn 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.269
 and when I realize that I am going to continue but also recognize the situation 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.249
 1 Munich 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.089
 who participates 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.909
 then with long sounding competitions the lecture coach would have been 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.319
 Doreen Meier 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.450
 ten of the 13th 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.429
 and from 14 to eight thousand ten they count up 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.609
 when is the 14 meters 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.639
 No, I think we'll be more like you if I have you 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.069
 but who does not miss that 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.039
 polished already 20 years ago 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:56.299
 is one of the lightest of the 14 eight-thousand-meter red numbers 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.299
 Coma terrible snow chaos with it had to Rome 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.799
 Amongst these, my two friends are fatally assaulted north 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.009

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.159
 Do not fight back the party is no more that's understandable 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.899
 Geislingen a point where they have shown 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.220
 you can not miss do not want to call 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.709
 it can not go on anymore yes it was 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.029
 really back then after this serious accident 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.169
 Deuster devastated 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.259
 and if I'm looking for more kids 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.790
 Moan No Cry Lighting 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.899
 let explain to the little boy 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.629

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.989

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.809
 So high I went with the little scene was so carefree Minsk lead 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:48.180
 can 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.149
 the last remnants of childhood 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.449
 luck has happened to these terrorists I have lost 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.449
 and then, no, the far it laughs up to the word 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:02.189
 EA Islam gem is just a formerly pure accident happened 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.799
 because of the allegation of the series were due to human trafficking numbers 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.979
 I've come to insight for a quarter now go on is the best 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.669
 Do you want to promote medicine something you should do with driving 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.400
 happened in an old Opel and then sits down despite the car and on 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.600

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.020
 made that he is not the best dr 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.290
 then there were two encounters with the Dalai Lama 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.569
 yes that fits 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.029
 Ahlmann is for me always a person according to NI not 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.639
 indescribably 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.959
 appreciated and admired and then a man of course 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.639
 Bishopric with him together at a table dancing the traveling media speak 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.550
 but is so fascinated this man because Michael follows it seriously 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.120
 fascinated 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.000
 and who there are children where he belongs and then this himself 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.490
 Talk of tulips www TeleTrusT 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.430
 but also 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.430
 Wichmann made mentality Phil 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.849
 Philosophy they have 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.860
 and so even that became him up in this great heights with that 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.720
 EADS 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.240
 then they can live 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.009
 and it was magical that Switzerland was not hollow 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.699
 the emphasis to point out 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.960
 suppressed by the children 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.840
 that's why Uibel took 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.439
 Things you can not explain with Burgener 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.669
 Well, I also said that many were many 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.949

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.900

 come to an end now 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.150
 if in the background the European airspace is the table for 8 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.650
 a possibility 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.650
 hopes to draw attention to these abuses 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.719
 Pay attention to one today not to learn about customer issues such as travel maps 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.960
 because there is not so much 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.860
 a torch relay to himself 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.690

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.669
 down financial year lock-downs allowed to take off 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.270
 a Finn is not a journalist 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.970
 and then came to the media everything was already the girls so let such 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.270
 Do not polite things more 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.770

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.069
 just as many people have gone to the highest peaks that the 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.919
 well-known Sellrain is nothing 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:51.999
 for one thing missing 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:55.919
 the second highest victory over the continent and now hope for one 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.499
