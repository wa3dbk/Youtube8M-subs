00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.450
 good regards here we are going to show you how 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.240
 make a battery charger here have 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.300
 a fountain 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.370
 a sacred way of the year a diode of 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.720
 four paws 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:30.190
 the tin we have several screws about 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 wires of about 30 we also carry 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.550
 ready to be saved 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 well leave me here we have a terminal 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 that we can connect here in the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.339
 diodes but we would need 4 for the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 four legs but I'm going to say hello 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.690
 wire because at the moment I do not have 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.410
 the terminals 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.989
 I wanted to make videos 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.610
 good when we have the day you what 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.220
 they buy see and say 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.880
 the specifications of where the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.670
 positive battery cables and here 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.340
 says until from the coming stream 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 from the source what are we going to 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.409
 fix the strong on the wood 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.190
 good if we already look at god can see 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.360
 here is the current that comes from the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.030
 home to know that this 110 there are some 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.420
 610 and here we go to every 12 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.610
 volts 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.670
 good as I said right now 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.740
 we connect the two the two cables 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.490
 makes them are the current that comes from 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.259
 the good street of the house or wherever 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 so here we have the god of you 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.270
 that says so is this comes towards the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.329
 source 7 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.250
 the other does this must always be 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.280
 finish 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.420
 with winfrey and this is what the battery 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.870
 this device is this and this negative 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.580
 that goes to the battery well then here 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.950
 we have several exits because it is a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.040
 source that gave us I volt then 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.360
 everything stable that only come from him or 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 diode they go to everything to two kisses that I do not know 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.110
 still because I have not measured it I have to 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.110
 try those here here go to the battery 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.390
 good this 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.190
 the last part where we are going to concur 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.360
 the video of the battery charger 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.410
 so 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.800
 and already you know I said that here 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.600
 current street bullet and these are 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.700
 the exit 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.480
 remember that we only go to the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.310
 output cables to this 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.019
 that we measure it are the ones that gave us 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.019
 less voltage is not giving 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.340
 twenty and thirty last humans 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.510
 different then only that way 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.180
 it went like I told you it was going diodes 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.989
 so that we put a new one 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:19.010
 resistance is not necessary but use the 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 support of the press here we have to 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.400
 state if they put it in does this 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.489
 current 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.240
 to test the voltage that comes out of the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.150
 diode place to assembly 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.420
 but if we put it in 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.470
 in battery charge but for the voltage 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.470
 because for example 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.690
 - It's not giving 21 volts actually 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.690
 It is 9 voltage 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.450
 because that assembly of space that comes out 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.450
 must have demonstrated what 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.630
 he has paid 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.840
 Diego 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.769
 is the same with success we have that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.259
 voltage is real 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.639
 to the first thing I was not giving 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.289
 mind that he only did it but 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.419
 it's good that they take it into account because 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.999
 I was already trying to do it invented 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.729
 worlds error that I did not get like from 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:35.949
 how to lower the current a little though 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.529
 there is one that is being removed they put to 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.479
 downloaded and may decrease a bit the 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:45.330
 current I hope you like this idea 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:49.620
 because things can ask you what 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.620
 we will answer as soon as possible
