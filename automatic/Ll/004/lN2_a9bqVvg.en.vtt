but seeing some people's goal weight be
the<00:05:21.870> weight<00:05:22.050> i<00:05:22.080> started<00:05:22.680> at<00:05:24.020> made<00:05:25.020> me<00:05:25.259> a<00:05:25.289> little

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
the weight i started at made me a little

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.140 
the weight i started at made me a little
worried<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.830> i<00:05:29.009> was<00:05:29.159> at<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.310> healthy<00:05:29.699> BMI<00:05:29.880> to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
worried so and i was at a healthy BMI to

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.620 
worried so and i was at a healthy BMI to
begin<00:05:30.539> with<00:05:31.400> but<00:05:32.400> i<00:05:32.460> was<00:05:32.610> teetering<00:05:33.180> on

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
begin with but i was teetering on

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.879 
begin with but i was teetering on
overweight<00:05:34.199> so<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:36.030> kind<00:05:36.599> of<00:05:36.630> got<00:05:36.780> scared<00:05:37.500> of

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
overweight so I kind of got scared of

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.730 
overweight so I kind of got scared of
that<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.550> didn't<00:05:38.820> want<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.090> get<00:05:39.180> into<00:05:39.360> that

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
that and I didn't want to get into that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.800 
that and I didn't want to get into that
range<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:42.380> that's<00:05:43.380> my<00:05:43.590> story<00:05:43.620> i<00:05:44.659> started<00:05:45.659> at

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
range so that's my story i started at

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.499 
range so that's my story i started at
145<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.039> i'm<00:05:47.219> now<00:05:47.460> at<00:05:47.930> 125<00:05:49.789> and<00:05:50.789> i'm<00:05:50.849> five<00:05:51.479> foot

145 and i'm now at 125 and i'm five foot

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.969 
145 and i'm now at 125 and i'm five foot
five<00:05:52.169> so<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:52.500> puts<00:05:52.889> me<00:05:53.039> out<00:05:53.130> of<00:05:53.250> BMI<00:05:53.639> of<00:05:54.949> 20<00:05:55.949> or

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
five so that puts me out of BMI of 20 or
