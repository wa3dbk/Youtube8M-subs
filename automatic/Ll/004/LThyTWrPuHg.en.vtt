pretty much that was a famous saying I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.809 
pretty much that was a famous saying I
probably<00:02:10.590> said<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.979> wrong<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.700> I'm

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819

nagas at the end of this so right there
that's<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.370> symbolic<00:02:17.910> meaning<00:02:18.270> saying<00:02:18.510> she's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
that's a symbolic meaning saying she's
most<00:02:18.930> likely<00:02:19.020> dead<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.190> said<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.790> me

most likely dead like I said this is me

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
most likely dead like I said this is me
just<00:02:21.420> spitting<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.020> theories<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.740> mean

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
just spitting out theories but I mean

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.160 
just spitting out theories but I mean
still<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.760> sounds<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.360> possible<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:25.020> more

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

okami<00:02:43.080> nog<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.650> episode<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.100> find<00:02:44.370> out

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
okami nog of this episode we find out

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.979 
okami nog of this episode we find out
that<00:02:44.580> she<00:02:44.910> was<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.150> some<00:02:45.360> form<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.600> Catholic

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
that she was in some form of Catholic

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.870 
that she was in some form of Catholic
Church<00:02:46.230> guessing<00:02:46.980> working<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.520> Pope<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
Church guessing working for the Pope and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.240 
Church guessing working for the Pope and
she<00:02:48.239> had<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.510> assassinate<00:02:49.320> someone<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.100> most

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
she had to assassinate someone that most

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
she had to assassinate someone that most
likely<00:02:50.459> was<00:02:50.550> working<00:02:50.850> for<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> higher<00:02:51.270> figure

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
likely was working for a higher figure

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
likely was working for a higher figure
like<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.930> Pope<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.350> something<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> church

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like the Pope or something in the church

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.430 
like the Pope or something in the church
and<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.000> she<00:02:54.060> was<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.570> assassinate<00:02:55.200> someone

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and so she was to assassinate someone

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.560 
and so she was to assassinate someone
