if<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> new<00:02:15.569> player<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.489> really<00:02:17.489> urge

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
if you are a new player I really urge

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.539 
if you are a new player I really urge
you<00:02:17.939> do<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.360> play<00:02:18.750> free<00:02:19.049> for<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.409> it's<00:02:19.890> really

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
you do not play free for all it's really

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.059 
you do not play free for all it's really
not<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.939> good<00:02:21.150> choice<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:22.319> get<00:02:22.620> your<00:02:22.799> feet<00:02:23.040> wet

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
not a good choice to get your feet wet

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.089 
not a good choice to get your feet wet
in<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.700> multiplayer<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.540> actually<00:02:25.379> suggest

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
in the multiplayer I actually suggest

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.119 
in the multiplayer I actually suggest
you<00:02:26.280> should<00:02:26.370> try<00:02:26.700> out<00:02:26.730> combat<00:02:27.720> training<00:02:28.129> if

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
you should try out combat training if

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.530 
you should try out combat training if
you<00:02:29.280> want<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.489> play<00:02:29.579> free-for-all<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.090> combat

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.199 
you want to play free-for-all in combat
training<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.290> might<00:02:31.590> help<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.069> bit<00:02:32.129> but<00:02:33.030> i

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
training that might help you a bit but i

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.910 
training that might help you a bit but i
would<00:02:33.510> suggest<00:02:33.659> playing<00:02:34.079> team<00:02:34.409> deathmatch

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
would suggest playing team deathmatch

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
would suggest playing team deathmatch
that<00:02:35.370> way<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.609> have<00:02:35.730> teammates<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.750> can

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that way you have teammates that you can

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.640 
that way you have teammates that you can
rely<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:39.269> entire<00:02:39.629> burden<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.349> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
rely on and the entire burden of the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.619 
rely on and the entire burden of the
game<00:02:40.859> is<00:02:41.099> not<00:02:41.250> solely<00:02:41.670> resting<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.599> your

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
game is not solely resting on your

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.589 
game is not solely resting on your
shoulders<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.939> is<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.209> reason<00:02:45.239> i

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
shoulders because that is one reason i

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.379

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
free-for-all and I think that it makes

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.280 
free-for-all and I think that it makes
for<00:03:05.370> some<00:03:05.579> interesting<00:03:05.730> gameplay<00:03:06.540> commentary
