right into the band's friendly and we

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.580 
right into the band's friendly and we
can<00:02:47.769> get<00:02:47.830> on<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.069> gas<00:02:52.230> again<00:02:53.230> looking<00:02:53.470> at

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
can get on the gas again looking at

can get on the gas again looking at
sparse<00:02:54.310> hair<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.670> see<00:02:54.880> see<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.360> clump<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.690> hoses

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
sparse hair can see see a clump of hoses

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.380 
sparse hair can see see a clump of hoses

and the nearside own business we're
coming<00:02:58.660> up<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.959> crest<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.500> hill<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:01.180> what

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
coming up to a crest of a hill so what

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.520 
coming up to a crest of a hill so what
we<00:03:01.420> want<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.630> do<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.930> get<00:03:02.049> ourselves<00:03:02.170> into

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
we want to do is get ourselves into

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.210 
we want to do is get ourselves into
position<00:03:02.920> one<00:03:03.100> nice<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.519> early<00:03:05.040> check<00:03:06.040> nodes

near side hoses and driveways they're

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.199 
near side hoses and driveways they're
clear<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:09.489> safe<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.760> proceed<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.150> the

your<00:03:16.450> Arlene<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:18.880> cut<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> daisies

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
your Arlene so when we cut the daisies

your Arlene so when we cut the daisies
as<00:03:19.570> it's<00:03:19.720> known<00:03:19.810> as<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:21.250> gives<00:03:21.430> us<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.670> much

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
as it's known as it gives us a much

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.819 
as it's known as it gives us a much

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.000 
can see around you and then get yourself
in<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.600> correct<00:06:27.810> position<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.440> D<00:06:28.590> without

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
in the correct position to D without

in the correct position to D without
each<00:06:29.160> hazard<00:06:29.610> get<00:06:29.910> yourself<00:06:30.210> in<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.330> correct

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
each hazard get yourself in the correct

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.050 
each hazard get yourself in the correct
speed<00:06:30.780> and<00:06:31.130> very<00:06:32.130> essentially<00:06:32.580> make<00:06:32.880> sure<00:06:33.000> you

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
speed and very essentially make sure you

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.330 
speed and very essentially make sure you
pick<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.390> correct<00:06:33.660> gear<00:06:33.919> little<00:06:34.919> clue<00:06:35.070> here

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
pick the correct gear little clue here

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.890 
pick the correct gear little clue here
look<00:06:35.520> at<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:35.669> modern<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.090> road<00:06:36.240> is<00:06:36.450> it<00:06:36.630> fresh

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
look at the modern the road is it fresh

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.610 
look at the modern the road is it fresh
if<00:06:37.440> so<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.669> know<00:06:39.540> disappear<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.290> tractor<00:06:40.560> up

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
if so you know disappear the tractor up

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.790 
if so you know disappear the tractor up
ahead<00:06:40.770> again<00:06:41.460> looking<00:06:41.820> up<00:06:41.940> ahead<00:06:42.060> we<00:06:42.330> see

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
ahead again looking up ahead we see

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.930 
ahead again looking up ahead we see
built-up<00:06:43.800> area<00:06:44.070> so<00:06:44.340> we<00:06:44.430> can<00:06:44.460> ticipate<00:06:44.790> to

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
built-up area so we can ticipate to

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.640 
built-up area so we can ticipate to
change<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.180> speed<00:06:45.360> limit<00:06:45.630> we<00:06:45.720> change<00:06:45.990> we<00:06:46.500> can

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
change the speed limit we change we can

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.020 
change the speed limit we change we can
anticipate<00:06:46.860> pedestrians<00:06:47.610> we<00:06:47.729> can<00:06:47.880> anticipate

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
anticipate pedestrians we can anticipate

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.420 
anticipate pedestrians we can anticipate
vehicles<00:06:48.720> and<00:06:48.870> so<00:06:48.990> on<00:06:49.110> and<00:06:49.890> there<00:06:50.040> we<00:06:50.100> go<00:06:50.160> there

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
vehicles and so on and there we go there

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.520 
vehicles and so on and there we go there
to<00:06:50.550> change<00:06:50.729> the<00:06:50.790> speed<00:06:50.970> limits<00:06:51.470> using<00:06:52.470> the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
to change the speed limits using the

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.840 
to change the speed limits using the
system<00:06:52.680> flexible<00:06:53.160> here<00:06:53.340> we<00:06:53.460> would<00:06:53.580> just<00:06:53.700> use

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
system flexible here we would just use

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.520 
system flexible here we would just use
correct<00:06:54.360> acceleration<00:06:54.960> since<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.260> roll<00:06:55.440> off

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
correct acceleration since the roll off

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.590 
correct acceleration since the roll off
the<00:06:55.680> throttle<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.040> just<00:06:56.639> Mary<00:06:56.850> 30<00:06:57.270> miles<00:06:57.510> an

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
the throttle and just Mary 30 miles an

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.200 
the throttle and just Mary 30 miles an
