00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello welcome to this new video and in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.060
 this time I want to show you the process 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.919
 to download google box books 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.290
 because this only allows us 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.730
 visualize them online for this we are going to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
 use a call tool 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 google box download that works so much 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.199
 for windows and for mac in windows 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 it works both for windows xp view and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.019
 windows 7 the format in which they are saved 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 It is in pdf format as well as in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 jpg and png format so you can 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.809
 visualize on any device with 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.800
 different resolutions then let's see 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.059
 the process 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.610
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.440
 then it is to download the application and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.610
 follow the installation processes as 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 any other program 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.450
 once installed the program opens 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.910
 automatically what we have to do 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.290
 then it is to look for our book or 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.110
 magazine that we want to download 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.850
 remember that some books are not 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.449
 complete due to copyright 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.060
 they have this so google 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.070
 restricts some pages then one 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 Once we have our book we open it 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.899
 completely that is displayed 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 and simply what we have to do 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.780
 is to copy the address of this book the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.090
 we copy we go to the program we paste 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.850
 here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.950
 and we select the format in 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.109
 The most recommended is the format 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.040
 pdf we select the resolution 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.960
 depending on our device 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.820
 and once the resolution is selected 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.410
 we select our folder where 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 going to save in this case I'm going to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.970
 place on the desk and once done 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 this simply what we have to 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.410
 do is click start 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 Here it shows us the number of pages 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 in this case they are 84 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.180
 we wait a few minutes not 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 delay depending on the size of the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.310
 book of the magazine and ready 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.180
 here I finish downloading and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.130
 convert it to pdf format we are going to 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 open it and as you see here they are 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.520
 a total of 84 pages if you want 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.560
 convert it to another type of format for 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.989
 that you can read it much more comfortable in 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.690
 a device for example of readers 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.400
 of electronic books what you have to 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.890
 do what I recommend is a page 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.900
 that is called on line convert is a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.850
 page that allows us to convert everything 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.459
 file type here select that 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.750
 format for electronic books 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.540
 selections as the format that supports 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.150
 your device and the only thing you have to 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.959
 do is go here where it says select 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.630
