00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
let's go through the ports on top I can

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.449 
let's go through the ports on top I can
see<00:03:25.380> I've<00:03:25.769> got<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> switch<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
see I've got this is the switch on and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.310 
see I've got this is the switch on and
off<00:03:30.000> button<00:03:30.480> it's<00:03:30.720> also<00:03:31.019> says<00:03:31.380> play<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.160> pose

off button it's also says play and pose

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.320 
off button it's also says play and pose
I'm<00:03:34.320> not<00:03:34.890> quite<00:03:35.130> sure<00:03:35.160> what<00:03:35.550> these<00:03:35.730> are<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
I'm not quite sure what these are I

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.009 
I'm not quite sure what these are I
think<00:03:36.810> that's<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.440> go<00:03:37.560> back<00:03:38.480> use<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.510> bottom

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
think that's to go back use the bottom

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.130 
think that's to go back use the bottom
button<00:03:40.850> on<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:42.030> side<00:03:42.269> I've<00:03:42.540> got<00:03:42.720> nothing

let's try to pour this up for it
batteries<00:04:17.910> off<00:04:18.239> no<00:04:18.480> it's<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:19.049> actually

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
working

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:31.230 
working
so<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.180> says<00:04:22.040> untreated<00:04:23.040> 4.0

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240
