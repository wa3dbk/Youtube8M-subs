pellet<00:00:14.880> reactor<00:00:15.560> now<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.010> these

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
pellet reactor now the way that these

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.359 
pellet reactor now the way that these
things<00:00:17.400> work<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.270> there<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.960> pellets<00:00:19.949> inside

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
things work is there is pellets inside

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.580 
things work is there is pellets inside
that<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.720> made<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.789> biodegradable<00:00:23.789> polymer

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
that are made of a biodegradable polymer

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
that are made of a biodegradable polymer
now<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:25.830> these<00:00:26.039> pellets<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.970> they

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
now what these pellets do is they

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
now what these pellets do is they
actually<00:00:27.359> need<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.380> certain<00:00:28.920> kind<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.340> bacteria

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually need a certain kind of bacteria

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually need a certain kind of bacteria
that<00:00:30.650> assimilates<00:00:31.650> nitrates<00:00:32.369> phosphates<00:00:34.700> now

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that assimilates nitrates phosphates now

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
that assimilates nitrates phosphates now
the<00:00:35.760> tumbling<00:00:36.390> effect<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.200> sheds<00:00:37.980> these

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the tumbling effect actually sheds these

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.209 
the tumbling effect actually sheds these
bacteria<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.440> bacteria<00:00:40.680> are

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
bacteria off and these bacteria are

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
bacteria off and these bacteria are
large<00:00:41.520> enough<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.879> stick<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> water

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
large enough to stick to the water

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
large enough to stick to the water
tension<00:00:43.649> created<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> bubbles<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
tension created in the bubbles and a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.060 
tension created in the bubbles and a
protein<00:00:45.600> skimmer

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
protein skimmer

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.270 
protein skimmer
so<00:00:47.070> those<00:00:47.340> bacterias<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.000> shed<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.440> then

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so those bacterias are shed off and then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240 
so those bacterias are shed off and then
moved<00:00:50.520> by<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.960> by<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> protein<00:00:52.469> skimmer<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
moved by the by the protein skimmer and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.700 
moved by the by the protein skimmer and
then<00:00:53.699> more<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.660> growing<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
then more of them are growing and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.849 
then more of them are growing and
feeding<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.420> bacteria<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.140> our<00:00:58.440> sorry<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
feeding on bacteria and our sorry the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
feeding on bacteria and our sorry the
nitrates<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> phosphates<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> create<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
nitrates and phosphates to create or to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.390 
nitrates and phosphates to create or to
assimilate<00:01:02.250> them<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.719> basically<00:01:04.400> continuing

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
assimilate them and basically continuing

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.960 
assimilate them and basically continuing
the<00:01:05.519> phosphates<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> nitrates

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the phosphates and nitrates

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.600 
the phosphates and nitrates
these<00:01:08.210> pallets<00:01:08.690> do<00:01:08.960> eventually<00:01:09.860> dissolve

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
these pallets do eventually dissolve

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.040 
these pallets do eventually dissolve
because<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:12.560> bacteria<00:01:12.740> needs<00:01:13.430> also<00:01:14.150> on<00:01:14.750> them

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
because the bacteria needs also on them

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.860 
because the bacteria needs also on them
they<00:01:15.260> does<00:01:15.440> simply<00:01:16.160> what<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.090> actually<00:01:17.270> uses

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
they does simply what it actually uses

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.780 
they does simply what it actually uses
with<00:01:18.140> managing<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.070> eventually<00:01:19.400> these

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
with managing so eventually these

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.490 
with managing so eventually these
eventually<00:01:20.420> dissolving<00:01:21.080> need<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.380> be

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
eventually dissolving need to be

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.180 
eventually dissolving need to be
replaced

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
replaced

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.640 
replaced
now<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.090> tumbling<00:01:23.630> effect<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:24.380> sheds

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
now the tumbling effect is what sheds

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.240 
now the tumbling effect is what sheds
the<00:01:24.890> bacteria<00:01:25.370> off<00:01:25.520> again<00:01:25.880> as<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.150> mentioned

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the bacteria off again as I mentioned

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
the bacteria off again as I mentioned
the<00:01:28.250> flow<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.910> water<00:01:29.240> comes<00:01:29.570> out<00:01:29.750> here

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the flow of that water comes out here

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.110 
the flow of that water comes out here
and<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> caught<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> protein

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
and it is caught up with the protein

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.830 
and it is caught up with the protein
skimmer<00:01:33.320> as<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.710> lots<00:01:34.950> miss<00:01:35.190> me

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
skimmer as you can see lots miss me

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
skimmer as you can see lots miss me
that's<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.020> gone<00:01:37.170> pellet<00:01:37.620> reactors<00:01:38.550> work

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that's all gone pellet reactors work

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
that's all gone pellet reactors work
they<00:01:39.090> work<00:01:39.270> quite<00:01:39.600> effectively<00:01:40.370> there's<00:01:41.370> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
they work quite effectively there's a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
they work quite effectively there's a
couple<00:01:41.670> different<00:01:42.030> brands<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.450> markets

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
couple different brands in the markets

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
couple different brands in the markets
but<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:43.080> highly<00:01:43.380> recommend<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.190> do<00:01:44.369> work

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
but I highly recommend them they do work

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.380 
but I highly recommend them they do work
great<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.690> take<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.290> time<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:47.390> cycle

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
great that you take some time to cycle

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990 
great that you take some time to cycle
and<00:01:48.479> start<00:01:48.780> working<00:01:49.400> they<00:01:50.400> told<00:01:50.610> me<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.910> would

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and start working they told me it would

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
and start working they told me it would
be<00:01:51.180> four<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> six<00:01:51.750> weeks<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.229> ended<00:01:52.650> up<00:01:52.770> being

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
be four to six weeks I ended up being

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.590 
be four to six weeks I ended up being
about<00:01:53.190> three<00:01:53.490> months<00:01:53.759> before<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.270> started

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
about three months before they started

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
about three months before they started
working<00:01:54.780> effectively<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.040> did<00:01:56.280> start

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
working effectively when they did start

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420 
working effectively when they did start
working<00:01:56.910> we're<00:01:57.420> great<00:01:57.890> there<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> hope

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
working we're great there you go I hope
