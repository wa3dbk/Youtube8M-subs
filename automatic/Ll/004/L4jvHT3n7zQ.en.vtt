00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.749
 hello welcome to this tutorial in Spanish 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.749
 about cobos and cyberbullying by sexist 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.570
 as you will know in no page that in my life there crowd 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.330
 that explains in a simple way how to dictate the game so we can 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 jump high with the island 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.109
 lidia can show you 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 those who have to modify it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 and as we do not have to do it in a very simple way 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.480
 dover program files 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 I was looking for the hospital folder for the game 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.820
 in all going to see you I said more confident 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 we went in there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 and the file that we have to modify if hamas jandrín point cfg 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.740
 the stretch is cobo goat because he avoided respect in this case bushehr bloc 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.890
 notes 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.620
 once inside 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.670
 let's give all this not be all 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.630
 e this unit of which we can 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.760
 we can modify the permeable jobo to this we do not care 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 let's go down 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.140
 go deciding month 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.990
 and we're going to this part and and jungle licks 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 guess maybe in the list of all the bicycle that are in the game 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.040
 we also have the matinee so 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 which we can not modify for any reason 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.110
 It does not matter if they avoid these names that are there 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.470
 they will not be able to modify it because if the game is programmed 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.490
 but the new bicycle if we can modify it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.390
 then this case 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.760
 in the bulli warned the file 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.090
 original that I obviously do not have backup so that this could not be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 confuse 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.620
 there they are then 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.060
 you should appear to you these values ​​not true 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.790
 what are the values ​​of fabol 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.979
 who what we have to avoid us 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.850
 to avoid the speed 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 to change the speed 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.020
 the gesture 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.140
 where is the drunkness 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.510
 in front of your home you can 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.460
 this x peking 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.259
 this one in the speed 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.259
 that we are going to give us another bicycle 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.459
 I'm not willing and if I broke it in 62 points 0 5 3 points 0 as you can see 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.609
 Much was uncomfortable with the success siena 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.559
 or yesterday is always a process 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.939
 we copy 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.060
 and let's go changing reads the whole bike the value 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.479
 If you do not want to print by pulling 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.709
 one by one the bicycles 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.749
 ceded in that and change everything 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.279
 all the speeds of the visible points in the visit because bicycle and 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.939
 wait 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.029
 it's a spa center to wet it xix 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.169
 any incident that this one grabs 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.479
 percent 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.339
 bandar faster in a bad 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:59.919
 this to laugh at has no greater incidence entering the game no no 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.969
 will influence nothing if what they often change 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.839
 it is unpredictable to change it in green rehn 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.069
 up there indicate the values ​​that you have to return 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.919
 here 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.049
 fr or four 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.699
 from poper 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.539
 Kiko Moya has said he has no influence from the euro 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.179
 Well, this is the one who investigates 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:28.149
 this is what it is to respect the speed now let's move on to the jump 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 and for that we have to go down 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.550
 and we come to this line 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.129
 so you can 27 harlan 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.379
 easily 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 when they see this command line that I'm marking 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.589
 ap low of that 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:45.629
 there they have to go 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.629
 nocetti liquidated again the list of bicycles 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.789
 and that it does not matter to modify 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.799
 in this case we are going to modify them all 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.799
 we go to the last line does not hit there 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.989
 from the last line we count back 6 paci 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.609
 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.559
 and we got to this part 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:15.889
 here we are going to change it 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.269
 to three 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.419
 because three of a is going to be a pretty acceptable jump even though she 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.240
 fairly tall 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.479
 but that will not cost us as it will not influence the mobile too much 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:32.379
 percent of the game 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.430
 what happens if you put a value too high efe 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.189
 the country loses 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.589
 lose balance let's say when you land after the jump when 

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.599
 they are only loses playoff then 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.150
 so as not to influence too much, do not set values ​​very high or very 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.729
 the belches that yes no 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.680
 is going to happen falling the truth thing and 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.639
 and the other thing is that it becomes playable powel 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.569
 so 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:58.930
 put values 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.050
 not so high 3 I advise you that it is ok can now I am going to show you 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.070
 I'm going to show you what happens with these values ​​that did not change so much that 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.169
 the bike arrives all that 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.749
 Well, we close you, keep them on a stretcher after boarding because 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.479
 I have and tano 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.089
 we open the game 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.089
 yar'adua move 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.809
 what effect did he have had we did this 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.020
 let's go directly to the eta building 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.809
 with you by means of still not modified 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:53.309
 in the part of the doctor vitorio also madelan I'll show you how to do 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:54.509
 that 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.319
 it's like changing objects like removing objects 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.809
 as well as the students 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.809
 the perishable cce 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.050
 that it is not difficult to do either 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.499
 but now it's going to happen directly league 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.499
 it summons us and on the left 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.990
 good to be this filmmaker is called crack 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.990
 bm who allegedly recognize her 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.710
 and let's see with three points 0 0 0 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.159
 I love the height they reach 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.069
 that is not for nothing 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.270
 discreet or can see is quite the bbc hague 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 try it in height and reach them 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.139
 i am the buck and sending him 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.960
 When he falls to the ground he did not accept that it is comfort the character sees it 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.839
 sideways 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.929
 that is why they try not to put a table too high because they are inevitably going to 

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:56.929
 have poor mobility on the part of the eu 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.680
 of the character 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.599
 and with 100 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.430
 achieve this speed 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.729
 that is not for nothing and that either 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.750
 which is pretty fast 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.439
 i fiz hilde 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:12.159
 way 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.530
 but that would be all that I could share with you 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.759
 I hope you liked it and it has served all the people who walk 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.289
 looking for this information 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.369
 and they swim against thug no side 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:28.590
 but that of utah I forget that was done with a lot of affection 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.660
 I will soon watch other videos showing them how to continue and tam 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.219
 go 

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.209
 other things said
