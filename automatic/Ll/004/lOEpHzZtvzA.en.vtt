seeing<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.720> clan<00:03:18.140> castle<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.590> middle<00:03:18.830> as

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
seeing the clan castle in the middle as

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.710 
seeing the clan castle in the middle as
always<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:19.640> well<00:03:19.850> as<00:03:20.000> these<00:03:20.180> triangulated

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
always as well as these triangulated

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.680 
always as well as these triangulated
expose<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:22.010> awesome<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:23.209> mortars<00:03:23.540> are

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
expose that is awesome the mortars are

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.449 
expose that is awesome the mortars are
triangulated<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.500> well<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.100> one<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.430> a

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
triangulated as well but this one is a

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.400 
triangulated as well but this one is a
little<00:03:25.519> bit<00:03:25.970> far<00:03:26.269> out<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.750> would<00:03:27.170> try<00:03:27.380> to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
little bit far out I would try to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.990 
little bit far out I would try to
reorganize<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.550> somehow<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:30.080> bring<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.470> in

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
reorganize it somehow to bring that in

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.250 
reorganize it somehow to bring that in
because<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.150> very<00:03:32.360> very<00:03:32.570> important<00:03:33.140> for

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
because it's very very important for

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.199 
because it's very very important for
that<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.620> be<00:03:33.800> a<00:03:34.010> little<00:03:34.400> more<00:03:34.580> centralized

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
that to be a little more centralized

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.420 
that to be a little more centralized
your<00:03:36.080> air<00:03:36.230> defenses<00:03:36.650> are<00:03:36.860> within<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.160> walls

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
your air defenses are within the walls

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.130 
your air defenses are within the walls
and<00:03:37.790> they're<00:03:37.970> pretty<00:03:38.269> well-protected<00:03:38.690> down

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
and they're pretty well-protected down

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.590 
and they're pretty well-protected down
here<00:03:39.470> but<00:03:39.620> these<00:03:39.830> ones<00:03:40.040> up<00:03:40.220> here<00:03:40.250> are<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> little

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
here but these ones up here are a little

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.140 
here but these ones up here are a little
vulnerable<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.410> attack<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.100> i<00:03:43.700> might<00:03:44.120> even

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
vulnerable to attack so i might even

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.240 
vulnerable to attack so i might even
spread<00:03:44.630> them<00:03:44.810> out<00:03:44.959> because<00:03:45.290> at<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.709> point<00:03:45.830> if

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
spread them out because at this point if

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.350 
spread them out because at this point if
a<00:03:46.340> giant<00:03:46.550> gets<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.000> he's<00:03:47.150> going<00:03:47.300> to

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
a giant gets in there he's going to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.080 
a giant gets in there he's going to
destroy<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.930> air<00:03:48.110> defenses<00:03:48.760> one<00:03:49.760> right<00:03:49.940> after

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
destroy to air defenses one right after

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.580 
destroy to air defenses one right after
the<00:03:50.239> other<00:03:50.330> which<00:03:50.660> could<00:03:50.840> be<00:03:50.959> bad<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.410> i<00:03:51.440> would

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the other which could be bad so i would

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.630 
the other which could be bad so i would
definitely<00:03:51.620> at<00:03:51.980> least<00:03:52.040> spread<00:03:52.400> them<00:03:52.519> out

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
definitely at least spread them out

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.900 
definitely at least spread them out
maybe<00:03:53.540> put<00:03:53.810> them<00:03:53.930> where<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.910> elixir

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
maybe put them where the elixir

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.370 
maybe put them where the elixir
collectors<00:03:56.300> are<00:03:56.450> or<00:03:56.600> put<00:03:56.780> one<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.080> them<00:03:57.200> where

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
collectors are or put one of them where

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.890 
collectors are or put one of them where
it<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.590> something<00:03:57.860> along<00:03:58.130> those<00:03:58.280> lines<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:59.510> i

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
it is something along those lines but i

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.780 
it is something along those lines but i
like<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.170> layout<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.680> base<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:01.489> whole

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
like the layout of the base this whole

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.640 
like the layout of the base this whole
section<00:04:02.180> right<00:04:02.450> here<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.810> open<00:04:03.140> which<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.410> good

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
section right here is open which is good

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.520 
section right here is open which is good
for<00:04:03.680> kiting<00:04:04.340> if<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:05.150> will<00:04:05.360> guiding<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
for kiting if you will guiding the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.530 
for kiting if you will guiding the
Giants<00:04:07.280> around<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.850> base<00:04:08.000> which<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.269> going<00:04:08.480> to

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
Giants around the base which is going to

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.479 
Giants around the base which is going to
be<00:04:08.660> good<00:04:08.810> because<00:04:09.050> your<00:04:09.290> exposé<00:04:09.709> can<00:04:10.280> just

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
be good because your exposé can just

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.009 
be good because your exposé can just
continue<00:04:10.730> shooting<00:04:11.060> at<00:04:11.330> them<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:11.660> definitely

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
continue shooting at them so definitely

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.509 
continue shooting at them so definitely
a<00:04:12.080> good<00:04:12.200> job<00:04:12.350> with<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:13.130> main<00:04:13.310> thing<00:04:13.489> is

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
a good job with that the main thing is

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.770 
a good job with that the main thing is
going<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:13.910> upgrading<00:04:14.330> your<00:04:14.360> Wizards

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
going to be upgrading your Wizards

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.699 
going to be upgrading your Wizards
moving<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.680> mortar<00:04:16.100> somehow<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.709> yeah

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
moving in this mortar somehow and yeah

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.020 
moving in this mortar somehow and yeah
it's<00:04:18.830> slowly<00:04:19.070> upgrading<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.609> rest<00:04:19.790> of<00:04:19.910> them

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
it's slowly upgrading the rest of them

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.779 
it's slowly upgrading the rest of them
you<00:04:20.299> did<00:04:20.450> rush<00:04:20.690> as<00:04:20.840> well<00:04:21.049> but<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:22.430> base<00:04:22.580> isn't

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
you did rush as well but the base isn't

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.029 
you did rush as well but the base isn't
too<00:04:23.030> bad<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.510> good<00:04:24.020> job<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.289> that<00:04:24.320> frosty<00:04:24.860> I'm

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
too bad so good job with that frosty I'm

I<00:04:51.810> know<00:04:52.230> it's<00:04:52.740> unfortunate<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.700> looked<00:04:53.910> at
