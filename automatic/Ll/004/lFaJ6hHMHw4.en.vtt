through these different settings and

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.629 
through these different settings and
then<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.389> optimizes<00:01:17.109> another<00:01:17.859> cool<00:01:18.159> thing<00:01:18.189> too

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
then it optimizes another cool thing too

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:23.819 
then it optimizes another cool thing too
is<00:01:18.789> if<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:19.299> have<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:20.460> USB<00:01:21.460> Drive<00:01:21.880> or<00:01:22.590> let's<00:01:23.590> say

for example let's say you use your

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.440 
for example let's say you use your
computer<00:04:36.530> also<00:04:36.800> as<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.190> fax<00:04:37.639> machine<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.330> know

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
computer also as a fax machine you know

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.810

how<00:04:38.539> you<00:04:38.600> have<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.960> fax<00:04:39.229> modem<00:04:39.710> well<00:04:40.610> that's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
how you have a fax modem well that's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.340 
how you have a fax modem well that's
great<00:04:41.120> then<00:04:41.389> you<00:04:41.479> don't<00:04:41.690> want<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.960> shut<00:04:42.139> this

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
great then you don't want to shut this

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.260 
great then you don't want to shut this
one<00:04:42.560> off<00:04:42.620> right<00:04:42.889> here<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.250> says<00:04:43.430> fax<00:04:43.820> but<00:04:44.060> let's

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
one off right here it says fax but let's

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.510 
one off right here it says fax but let's
say<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.450> never<00:04:44.660> even<00:04:44.990> use<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.320> well<00:04:46.310> that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
say you never even use that well that

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.330 
say you never even use that well that
takes<00:04:47.150> up<00:04:47.450> part<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.500> your<00:04:48.710> computer's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.610 
takes up part of your computer's
resources<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.600> can<00:04:50.900> actually<00:04:51.260> disable

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
resources so you can actually disable

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.500 
resources so you can actually disable
that<00:04:51.979> this<00:04:52.190> doesn't<00:04:52.550> remove<00:04:52.940> anything<00:04:53.300> from

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
that this doesn't remove anything from

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.350 
that this doesn't remove anything from
your<00:04:53.840> computer<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:54.590> disables<00:04:55.310> all<00:04:55.550> these

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
your computer it just disables all these

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.690 
your computer it just disables all these

real<00:05:02.810> fast<00:05:03.050> computer<00:05:03.530> and<00:05:03.680> then<00:05:03.770> they're

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
real fast computer and then they're

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.680 
real fast computer and then they're
disappointed<00:05:04.669> that<00:05:04.700> it's<00:05:04.910> not<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.120> fast

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
disappointed that it's not that fast
