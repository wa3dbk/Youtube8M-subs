 characters as caricatured as they are 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.520
 charismatic sporting prowess and rivalry 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.140
 worthy of the worst soap opera in a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 appreciable minestrone from large and

 take root as in the states also a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 cause of some pieces of commentators 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.640
 who preferred to do commentary 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.350
 matches weren't even matches of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 football instead of explaining them 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 subplots but in the land of the sol 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.619
 Levante has had a certain grip and energy 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 flames of this passion that have been 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.430
 yoox forgings a team of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.020
 IT developers for years now 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.180

 the series of titles created by the team 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.190
 Japanese seemed dead and buried but you 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.899
 who did not let the greedy escape 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.520
 opportunity to appropriate the license 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.860

 let's start from the contents forever 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 the strength of the software house 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.209
 Japanese well you will be pleased to know 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 that linux have surpassed this year 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.229
 until almost doubling by inserting into the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.590
 years of wrestlemania 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.690
 the new operation is not a simple one 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.610
 match collection in which to use the big ones 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.470
 glories of the past is a loyal one 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.569
 virtual reproduction of some of the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.970
 highest and unforgettable moments of the 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.190
 wwe where everything is repeated with a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.070
 obsessive attention to detail i 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.420
 videos introduced 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.550
 there are the original ones of the era le

 presentation in overlay e 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 even the granular TV filter 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.480
 they are reused during the clashes 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.490
 in addition to a series of objectives from 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.110
 complete to overcome emissions e 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.730
 carry on the events of the great 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.410
 fighters of the past 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.150
 hulk hogan was not exactly an actor 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.650
 from oscar but you must have a heart of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.840
 stone not to be moved even one 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.120
 little in front of his goal celebrations or 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.590
 goods of the mythical macho man or anchor e 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 spectacular rivalries they have given 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.520
 form to today's federation for a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
 passionate thirty years of rust 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.030
 armenia is a dream mode 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.770
 there's not much else to say about yoox 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.810
 however they didn't just push 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.880
 the pedal on the nostalgia factor have 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.950
 in fact reinserted the wwe universe mode 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.630
 expanding the excess in parallel 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.459
 possibility of customization of the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.830
 game to the player practically granted 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.110
 everything from moving the tabs 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.239
 all of rho and smackdown to the creation of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.220
 more or less long-lived cruel rivalries there 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.320
 you are wrestling maniacs then you will have to 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.360
 provision a suite of creation of 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.680
 elaborate characters like never before whose 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.720
 you can create your own version 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.430
 wiry to launch into matches o 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.100
 any kind of amanita you want 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.810
 you can even customize it 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.060
 the billboards of the public based on 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.620
 pre-existing superstar template o 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.049
 even create new leagues 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.610
 complete with custom belts and i 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.500
 federation logos not included in the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.329
 roster to all this, yes, yes 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.850
 then adds another new feature 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.070
 streak a dedicated undertaker mode 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.410
 the script can be played in two ways 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.209
 or as a survival man of powerful boss 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 fight undertaker can be 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.299
 checked to defend his 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.070
 endless list of victory you would have the 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.079
 better from a series of fighters 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.060
 or it will be faced with a difficulty 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.769
 clearly very high and with 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.910
 modified skill statistics to give 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.860
 hard to anyone 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.570
 in boss version fight the streak is one 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.130
 come to the ker art fans 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.840
 probably will not appreciate more than 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.910
 so much the survival variation of the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.680
 modality that has little to do with the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.670
 the gigantic royal record of victory 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.959
 wrestler 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.489
 obviously every type of match can 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.180
 to be tackled also in the match 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.160
 fast 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 avoid listing them all if followed 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.340
 wrestling you already know that mac mahon e 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.750
 comrades managed to invent themselves 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.799
 events of all kinds during their 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.510
 career 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.459
 the gameplay by its name 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.379
 the light of its own how many contents there 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.879
 dead 2 series is fun this is 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.349
 undeniable but the system of 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.090
 fighting always left a little 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.489
 wish for choices not always 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.320
 brilliant game design games this year 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.510
 in yoox in collaboration with visuals 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.010
 concepts have retouched the system 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.020
 increasing the speed of the shots 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.610
 adding various intermediate animations 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.560
 and adjusting the responsibility of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.780
 commands but they have not settled anyway 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.100
 the problems seen in the past 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 storm can have everything revolves around 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.280
 to counter-moves 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.570
 each shot can be countered with the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.190
 trigger pressure dedicated to 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.780
 counter and then start a series 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.889
 of attacks or country capable of overturning 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.479
 the match 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.490
 the resistance of the fighters is a lot 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.410
 sure high if it must be said that this year 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.250
 encounter are more responsive than easy to 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.110
 use 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.699
 however they maintain a random element 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.680
 which annoys not a little during 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.000
 match their timing depends on 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.860
 variable statistics based on 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.210
 fighters that force you to get used to 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.039
 at the pace of a limited number of 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.449
 characters and all too often the 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.520
 successful response appears 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.020
 depend on the case it is a 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.710
 fundamental of the structure created by 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.449
 Yoox 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.490
 yet it is certainly not a stable column 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.260
 on which to base the entire gameplay and not 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.660
 he is helped by a technical department that 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.520
 now he is showing his age heavily 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.530
 the animations in fact improved 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.510
 are still rather unrelated to each other 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.190
 strokes sometimes miss at random 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.169
 Please positions that the engine fatigue 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.150
 process and all launch moves 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.190
 dive or cage dedicated maneuvers 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.620
 environmental attacks return a 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.630
 feeling raw and forced complexity 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.970
 of the gra pling the spectacularity of the 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.500
 projections and the general dance of sockets 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.750
 and against taking them anyway 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.340
 the adrenaline-like experience against 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.840
 a friend but it is clear that the whole 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.900
 combat system should be reviewed by 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.280
 principle is that in wwe you that you have 14 i 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.630
 improvements are still too much 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.090
 marginal if you have listened 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.440
 however, you will have already been shaken 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.449
 the head when we talked about 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.830
 backward technical compartment not 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.449
 expect fighters for 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.340
 realistic a fine audience 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.810
 detailed or other miracles of the 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.460
 modern videogame 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.530
 the die in dublin with graphics passes through 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.240
 force of things in the background i 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 fighters albeit very loyal to the 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.510
 features in dresses 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.250
 are not polygons maxini 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.560
 particularly detailed by the forms 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.720
 even the enemy is in too much grainy 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.060
 does not make sparks falling in love sometimes 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.950
 without a why we did n't notice for 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.690
 the least big banks so few 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.700
 polygonal interpolation problem 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.320
 during the creation of the characters e 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.120
 dancer 's impacts of little subscribers 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.280
 above nothing to complain about instead 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.540
 sound a sampler of real events 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.670
 of the era is a soundtrack 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.650
 exceptional with regard to the 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.450
 longevity we imagined that you are already there 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.160
 realized the mass that title you that 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.840
 offers we are in front of a game 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.120
 potentially endless for a lover 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.030
 of wrestling that not only offers further 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.770
 40 in the legendary and unforgettable but 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.860
 also a universe mode managed by 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.820
 pleasure customization options 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.730
 impressive and a lot of unlock 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.800
 balls you won't get tired easily dab 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.540
 dab lewitt that 14 is still sweet 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.240
 serenade for every wrestling fan who 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.890
 the works must be respected in content 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.270
 of yoox are unparalleled 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.400
 and also the developers this year 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.540
 Nipponese have surpassed themselves by making 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.940
 some of the most playable events 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.920
 spectacular of wwe history 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.660
 pity that once again the real 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.760
 improvements concern only the contents e 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.560
 customizable elements and that the 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.480
 fighting system for a long time 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.460
 marked to some sensitive deficiencies 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.050
 has not yet been properly reviewed 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.600
 expect a dip in the memories 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.580
 but not a game with impeccable gameplay 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.760
 for that perhaps there is to wait for the 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:33.460
 next chapter 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.460
