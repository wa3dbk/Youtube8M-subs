00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
be bullish but I think after we've had

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.430 
be bullish but I think after we've had
our<00:00:37.910> heads<00:00:38.120> handed<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.690> us<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.989> last<00:00:39.140> several

our heads handed to us the last several

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.290 
our heads handed to us the last several
years<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:39.890> think<00:00:40.130> we're<00:00:40.730> all<00:00:40.850> trying<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.210> be

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.760 
years I think we're all trying to be
more<00:00:41.570> cautiously<00:00:42.440> optimistic<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:44.809> feels<00:00:45.440> like

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
more cautiously optimistic it feels like

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.460 
more cautiously optimistic it feels like
there's<00:00:46.070> changes<00:00:46.670> coming<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:47.470> welcome

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.930 
changes for us in this sector anyway and
I<00:00:51.620> would<00:00:51.830> say<00:00:52.040> that<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:53.650> probably<00:00:54.650> if<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.760> were

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
really have to take it all with a grain

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.959 
really have to take it all with a grain
of<00:01:26.659> salt<00:01:26.810> right<00:01:27.409> there's<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.219> lot<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.460> smoke<00:01:28.759> and

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
of salt right there's a lot of smoke and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.090

mirrors<00:01:29.329> there's<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.630> lot<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.840> deception<00:01:30.799> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
mirrors there's a lot of deception and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.609 
mirrors there's a lot of deception and
subterfuge<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.969> all<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.270> stuff<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:32.810> was<00:01:33.439> of

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
subterfuge and all this stuff I was of

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.559 
subterfuge and all this stuff I was of
the<00:01:33.799> opinion<00:01:33.889> that<00:01:34.310> when<00:01:34.999> they<00:01:35.119> were<00:01:35.209> saying

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
the opinion that when they were saying

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.599 
the opinion that when they were saying
they<00:01:35.719> were<00:01:35.780> doing<00:01:36.020> 80<00:01:36.319> billion<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.889> month<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.340> QE

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
they were doing 80 billion a month of QE

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.429 
they were doing 80 billion a month of QE
I<00:01:37.759> actually<00:01:38.209> believed<00:01:38.630> they<00:01:38.780> were<00:01:38.840> doing<00:01:39.109> 200

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
I actually believed they were doing 200

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.730 
I actually believed they were doing 200
billion<00:01:40.069> a<00:01:40.130> month<00:01:40.159> right<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.689> when<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.499> said

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
billion a month right so when they said

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.379 
billion a month right so when they said
they<00:01:42.859> were<00:01:42.920> stopping<00:01:43.490> huy<00:01:43.789> what<00:01:44.119> they<00:01:44.329> were

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
they were stopping huy what they were

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.719 
they were stopping huy what they were
probably<00:01:44.749> stopping<00:01:45.200> was<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.770> 80<00:01:45.950> billion<00:01:46.369> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
probably stopping was the 80 billion a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.519 
probably stopping was the 80 billion a
month<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.299> they're<00:01:47.479> still<00:01:47.569> doing<00:01:47.929> this<00:01:48.229> other

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
month but they're still doing this other

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:52.149 
month but they're still doing this other
amount<00:01:49.009> which<00:01:49.450> very<00:01:50.450> hard<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.810> verify<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.950> I

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
amount which very hard to verify but I

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.399 
amount which very hard to verify but I
that's<00:01:52.850> my<00:01:53.029> take<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.509> given<00:01:54.289> the

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
that's my take on it given the

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.160 
that's my take on it given the
circumstances<00:01:55.240> there's<00:01:56.240> no<00:01:56.509> way<00:01:56.689> they<00:01:56.929> can

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
circumstances there's no way they can

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
the whole shenanigan going if you look

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.889 
the whole shenanigan going if you look
at<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.249> chart<00:02:07.459> of<00:02:07.609> the<00:02:07.729> velocity<00:02:07.999> of<00:02:08.330> money

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
at a chart of the velocity of money

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.630 
at a chart of the velocity of money
see<00:02:09.019> you<00:02:09.349> know<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> money<00:02:09.739> supply<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.220> set<00:02:10.610> a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
see you know the money supply is set a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.420 
see you know the money supply is set a
sharp<00:02:11.150> drop<00:02:11.480> off<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.019> because<00:02:12.430> they've

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
sharp drop off is that because they've

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.729 
sharp drop off is that because they've
you<00:02:13.939> know<00:02:13.970> been<00:02:14.239> tapering<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.930> sort<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.379> well

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
you know been tapering and sort of well

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.410 
you know been tapering and sort of well
I<00:02:15.950> think<00:02:16.220> part<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:16.879> part<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
I think part of that part of the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.030 
I think part of that part of the
velocity<00:02:17.659> of<00:02:17.959> money<00:02:18.140> changes<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
velocity of money changes that the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.690 
velocity of money changes that the
wealthy<00:02:19.459> people<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:20.180> America<00:02:20.659> let's<00:02:20.870> say<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
wealthy people in America let's say you

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000 
wealthy people in America let's say you
know<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.120> retirees<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.989> haven't<00:02:24.290> saved<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
know the retirees that haven't saved a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.039 
know the retirees that haven't saved a
million<00:02:25.280> dollars<00:02:25.640> during<00:02:26.209> their<00:02:26.450> during

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
million dollars during their during

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.990 
million dollars during their during
their<00:02:27.170> lifetimes<00:02:27.650> they<00:02:27.890> were<00:02:27.950> putting<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.849> in

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
their lifetimes they were putting it in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.089 
their lifetimes they were putting it in
t-bills<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.659> five<00:02:29.870> percent<00:02:30.349> in<00:02:30.470> making<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.920> nice

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
t-bills at five percent in making a nice

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.610 
t-bills at five percent in making a nice
return<00:02:31.340> right<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:33.079> they<00:02:33.200> were<00:02:33.260> having<00:02:33.560> a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
return right and so they were having a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.960 
return right and so they were having a
nice<00:02:33.769> lifestyle<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.459> were<00:02:34.519> able<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.849> spend

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
nice lifestyle they were able to spend

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.449 
nice lifestyle they were able to spend
money<00:02:35.329> right<00:02:35.900> well<00:02:36.439> the<00:02:36.650> sudden<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.189> can't

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
money right well the sudden they can't

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.059 
money right well the sudden they can't
make<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:37.819> five<00:02:38.180> percent<00:02:38.420> yield<00:02:38.930> anymore<00:02:39.530> so

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
make that five percent yield anymore so

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.399 
make that five percent yield anymore so
they're<00:02:40.370> getting<00:02:40.760> worried<00:02:41.180> right<00:02:41.930> how<00:02:42.139> am<00:02:42.319> I

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
they're getting worried right how am I

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.199 
they're getting worried right how am I
going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.829> this<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.129> I<00:02:43.190> think<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.579> saw<00:02:43.849> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
going to do this so I think you saw a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.110 
going to do this so I think you saw a
pullback<00:02:45.139> this<00:02:45.769> year<00:02:46.069> in<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.639> the<00:02:46.670> retail

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
pullback this year in the in the retail

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.849 
pullback this year in the in the retail
holiday<00:02:47.420> sales<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:48.590> were<00:02:48.650> off

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
holiday sales I think they were off

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.039 
holiday sales I think they were off
fifteen<00:02:49.310> sixteen<00:02:49.819> percent<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.450> last<00:02:50.510> year

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
fifteen sixteen percent from last year

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.460 
fifteen sixteen percent from last year
so<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:51.739> think<00:02:51.859> that<00:02:52.250> fear<00:02:52.639> index<00:02:53.090> right<00:02:53.750> how<00:02:54.409> do

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
so I think that fear index right how do

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.830 
so I think that fear index right how do
i<00:02:54.590> how<00:02:55.069> do<00:02:55.129> I<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.730> my<00:02:55.909> good<00:02:56.120> lifestyle<00:02:56.599> I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
i how do I have my good lifestyle I

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.569 
i how do I have my good lifestyle I
think<00:02:57.109> people<00:02:57.290> are<00:02:57.500> worried<00:02:57.769> about<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.129> and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
think people are worried about that and

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.670 
think people are worried about that and
that's<00:02:59.000> decreasing<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.930> velocity<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> money

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
that's decreasing the velocity of money

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.849 
that's decreasing the velocity of money
how<00:03:01.609> close<00:03:01.879> do<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.150> think<00:03:02.239> we<00:03:02.840> are<00:03:03.019> too<00:03:03.049> you

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
how close do you think we are too you

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.869 
how close do you think we are too you

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
has been saying that they're going to be

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.729 
has been saying that they're going to be
raising<00:03:10.939> race<00:03:11.150> later<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.720> year<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.319> lot<00:03:12.709> of

raising race later this year a lot of

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.710 
raising race later this year a lot of
people<00:03:12.829> are<00:03:13.099> skeptical<00:03:13.430> about<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.269> do

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
people are skeptical about that so do

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.059 
people are skeptical about that so do
you<00:03:14.810> think<00:03:14.840> we're<00:03:15.109> still<00:03:15.349> in<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.560> edge<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.889> a

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
you think we're still in the edge of a

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.970 
you think we're still in the edge of a
major<00:03:16.639> collapse<00:03:17.030> right<00:03:17.389> now<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:18.500> know<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> lot

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
major collapse right now you know a lot

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.979 
major collapse right now you know a lot
of<00:03:19.040> us<00:03:19.280> I've<00:03:19.519> been<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.269> opinion<00:03:20.569> that

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
of us I've been of that opinion that

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.420 
of us I've been of that opinion that
this<00:03:21.109> is<00:03:21.319> coming<00:03:21.560> there's<00:03:21.919> no<00:03:22.069> way<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.250> avoid

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
this is coming there's no way to avoid

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.430 
this is coming there's no way to avoid
it<00:03:22.849> but<00:03:23.030> trying<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.449> get<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.750> timing<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.290> this

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
it but trying to get the timing on this

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.770 
it but trying to get the timing on this
is<00:03:24.500> ridiculous<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.519> know<00:03:25.549> i'm<00:03:25.819> i'm<00:03:26.510> usually

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
doesn't mean America is going to survive

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.909 
doesn't mean America is going to survive
it<00:05:16.240> just<00:05:16.449> means<00:05:16.660> they<00:05:16.960> may<00:05:17.169> survive<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.650> little

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
it just means they may survive a little

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.550 
it just means they may survive a little
bit<00:05:18.160> longer<00:05:18.539> once<00:05:19.539> this<00:05:19.720> thing<00:05:19.780> goes<00:05:20.169> it's<00:05:20.470> a

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
bit longer once this thing goes it's a

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.650 
bit longer once this thing goes it's a
it's<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.919> global<00:05:21.220> event<00:05:21.490> everyone<00:05:22.419> will<00:05:22.539> be

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
it's a global event everyone will be

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.740 
it's a global event everyone will be
effective<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:24.060> unfortunately<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:25.120> think<00:05:25.360> when

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
effective and unfortunately I think when

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.690 
effective and unfortunately I think when
history<00:05:26.020> shows<00:05:26.320> that<00:05:26.349> when<00:05:26.800> governments

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
history shows that when governments

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.430 
history shows that when governments
central<00:05:28.060> banks<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.450> their<00:05:28.510> politicians<00:05:29.050> get

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
central banks and their politicians get
