if we had not replaced it the process

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.290 
if we had not replaced it the process
would<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.670> same<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.300> condenser<00:01:38.300> keep

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
would be the same for the condenser keep

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.640 
would be the same for the condenser keep
the<00:01:39.390> line<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> flush<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> be

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the line we want to flush is going to be

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.750 
the line we want to flush is going to be
our<00:01:40.770> liquid<00:01:41.160> line<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.550> line<00:01:41.730> you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
our liquid line this is a line you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.880 
our liquid line this is a line you
normally<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.330> not<00:01:42.480> replace<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.620> I'll<00:01:43.710> tell

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
normally would not replace and I'll tell

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.290 
normally would not replace and I'll tell
you<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.130> whenever<00:01:44.490> possible<00:01:44.760> you<00:01:45.120> want<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
you what whenever possible you want to

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.730 
you what whenever possible you want to
take<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> line<00:01:45.750> off<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> vehicle<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.650> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
take a line off the vehicle and the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.790 
take a line off the vehicle and the
reason<00:01:46.980> for<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.520> when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.330> flush<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.800> you

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
reason for that is when you flush it you

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.080 
reason for that is when you flush it you
said<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.160> straight<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.760> down<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> your

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
said it's straight up and down in your

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
said it's straight up and down in your
container<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.660> way<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:51.990> debris<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
container that way all the debris and a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.720 
container that way all the debris and a
flush<00:01:52.740> slop<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
flush slop is going to go right to the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.400 
flush slop is going to go right to the
bottom<00:01:54.150> if<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> was<00:01:54.690> still<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:54.990> vehicle

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
bottom if it was still on the vehicle

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.570 
bottom if it was still on the vehicle
you<00:01:55.500> might<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.800> loop<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.190> something<00:01:56.310> you

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
you might have a loop or something you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.650 
you might have a loop or something you
might<00:01:56.730> not<00:01:56.970> be<00:01:57.090> able<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> debris

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
might not be able to get all the debris

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.590 
might not be able to get all the debris
out<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> taste<00:01:58.770> something<00:01:59.010> else<00:01:59.280> too<00:01:59.600> now

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
out of it taste something else too now

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000 
out of it taste something else too now
when<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.930> were<00:02:01.020> taking<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.500> good<00:02:01.620> look<00:02:01.800> at<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
when we were taking a good look at this

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.710 
when we were taking a good look at this
we<00:02:02.130> replaced<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.760> line<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.600> was

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
we replaced this line because it was

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.910 
we replaced this line because it was
stripped<00:02:04.080> right<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.470> we're<00:02:04.590> connected

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
stripped right there we're connected

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.050 
stripped right there we're connected
onto<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.130> condenser<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.700> had<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.970> be

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
onto the condenser so it had to be

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.850 
onto the condenser so it had to be
replaced<00:02:06.210> once<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.050> had<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.290> off<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.590> took<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
replaced once I had this off I took a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.830 
replaced once I had this off I took a
good<00:02:08.040> look<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.520> did<00:02:08.820> my<00:02:08.940> inspection<00:02:09.570> on<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
good look at it did my inspection on it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
good look at it did my inspection on it
tell<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> found<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.980> problem<00:02:11.250> now<00:02:12.090> if

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
tell you what I found a problem now if

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.730 
tell you what I found a problem now if
you<00:02:12.300> look<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> there's<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you look here you can see that there's a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680 
you look here you can see that there's a
split<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.610> our<00:02:14.700> rubber<00:02:14.940> covering<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.570> our

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
split in our rubber covering for our

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.660 
split in our rubber covering for our
luminal<00:02:16.170> line<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.680> that's<00:02:17.490> actually

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
luminal line here that's actually

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.370 
luminal line here that's actually
corrosion<00:02:18.330> from<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.570> battery<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
corrosion from the battery this is the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.750 
corrosion from the battery this is the
location<00:02:19.890> right<00:02:20.040> above<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.610> where<00:02:20.730> our

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
location right above this is where our

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.700 
location right above this is where our
battery<00:02:21.180> rests<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.500> where<00:02:22.620> it's

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
battery rests so you see it where it's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.380 
battery rests so you see it where it's
corroded<00:02:23.040> into<00:02:23.280> there<00:02:23.430> even<00:02:24.210> though<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.330> don't

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
corroded into there even though I don't

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.850 
corroded into there even though I don't
see<00:02:24.510> any<00:02:24.690> leak<00:02:24.870> detection<00:02:25.230> died<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.710> just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
see any leak detection died I'm just

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.780 
see any leak detection died I'm just
kind<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> curious<00:02:26.250> what's<00:02:26.430> underneath<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
kind of curious what's underneath a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.040 
kind of curious what's underneath a
let's<00:02:26.910> open<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.450> take<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.570> look<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.990> can

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
let's open it up and take a look we can

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.870 
let's open it up and take a look we can
take<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.320> knife<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.800> cut<00:02:34.890> our<00:02:35.100> insulation<00:02:35.700> off

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
take a knife and cut our insulation off

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.140 
take a knife and cut our insulation off
and<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.989> see<00:02:37.140> exactly<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.770> have

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.090 

yeah<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:42.959> battery<00:02:43.500> acid

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
yeah you see that's all battery acid

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.770 
yeah you see that's all battery acid
right<00:02:44.580> there<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> I'll<00:02:48.180> tell<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.450> what<00:02:48.630> I'm

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
right there and I'll tell you what I'm

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120 
right there and I'll tell you what I'm
starting<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.080> eat<00:02:49.140> into<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.530> line<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.040> can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
starting to eat into this line you can

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.290 
starting to eat into this line you can
see<00:02:50.220> pissing<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.850> way<00:02:50.940> around<00:02:51.030> there

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
see pissing it all the way around there

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.120 
see pissing it all the way around there
it<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.050> matter<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.440> time<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:53.040> would

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it be just a matter of time and it would

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.500 
it be just a matter of time and it would
eat<00:02:53.250> through<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.520> line<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.300> all

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
eat through this line and then that all

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.810 
eat through this line and then that all
the<00:02:54.630> refrigerant<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.680> lost<00:02:55.950> when<00:02:56.700> you're

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820

solvent<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.519> said<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.850> take<00:03:23.940> just

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
solvent like I said it's going take just

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.670 
solvent like I said it's going take just
a<00:03:24.150> small<00:03:24.300> amount<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.019> want<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.500> kind<00:03:25.590> of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
a small amount you want to be kind of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.780 
a small amount you want to be kind of
conservative<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.430> make<00:03:26.640> sure<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
conservative with this make sure you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.040 
conservative with this make sure you
have<00:03:26.880> enough<00:03:27.090> solvent<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> flush<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
have enough solvent to flush all the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.710 
have enough solvent to flush all the
components<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:29.400> system

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.480 

right<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.590> should<00:03:34.770> be<00:03:34.800> plenty<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.310> do

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
right there that should be plenty to do

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:49.520 
right there that should be plenty to do
our<00:03:35.610> job<00:03:40.490> reattach<00:03:41.490> our<00:03:41.910> tank<00:03:48.530> then

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
our job reattach our tank then

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.000 
our job reattach our tank then
pressurize<00:03:49.980> our<00:03:50.250> tank<00:03:50.880> there<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.270> are<00:03:52.010> now

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
pressurize our tank there we are now

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.950 
pressurize our tank there we are now
this<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.310> exactly<00:03:53.790> like<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.180> our<00:03:54.300> evaporator

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
this is exactly like on our evaporator

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.210 
this is exactly like on our evaporator
we've<00:03:55.110> got<00:03:55.260> our<00:03:55.380> flush<00:03:55.620> gun<00:03:55.830> we've<00:03:55.950> got<00:03:56.100> our
