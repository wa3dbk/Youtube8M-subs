00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.690 

the<00:00:41.180> first<00:00:41.420> thing<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.810> do<00:00:41.990> is<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.710> prepare<00:00:43.340> to

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
the first thing to do is to prepare to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.490 
the first thing to do is to prepare to
paint<00:00:44.590> in<00:00:45.590> other<00:00:45.770> words<00:00:46.360> do<00:00:47.360> some<00:00:47.500> thinking

paint in other words do some thinking

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.110 
paint in other words do some thinking
before<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:48.950> paint<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.000> painting<00:00:50.930> begins<00:00:51.320> I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
before the paint the painting begins I

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.730 
before the paint the painting begins I
think<00:00:53.120> I'll<00:00:53.480> bring<00:00:53.630> that<00:00:53.690> tree<00:00:54.080> over<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.500> little

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
think I'll bring that tree over a little

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.460 
think I'll bring that tree over a little
bit<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:56.200> this<00:00:57.200> isn't<00:00:57.440> like<00:00:59.830> that<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.220> then<00:01:01.430> the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
bit so this isn't like that and then the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.300 
bit so this isn't like that and then the
this<00:01:03.850> riverbank<00:01:04.850> comes<00:01:05.180> down<00:01:05.740> like<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.979> then

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
this riverbank comes down like that then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.700 
this riverbank comes down like that then
there's<00:01:07.609> all<00:01:07.789> of<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:08.119> business<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.049> here's

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710

want<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.210> be<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.479> loose<00:01:17.689> painting<00:01:18.170> and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
want this to be a loose painting and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.999 
want this to be a loose painting and
that's<00:01:18.560> why<00:01:19.030> well<00:01:20.030> one<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.390> reasons<00:01:21.009> that

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
that's why well one of the reasons that

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.910 
that's why well one of the reasons that
I'm<00:01:22.219> using<00:01:22.460> such<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:26.469> such<00:01:27.469> a<00:01:27.499> loose<00:01:29.920> technique

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
I'm using such a such a loose technique

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.069 
I'm using such a such a loose technique
for<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.219> drawing<00:01:31.759> because<00:01:31.969> you<00:01:32.749> set<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> standard

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
for a drawing because you set a standard

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.819 
for a drawing because you set a standard
in<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.619> beginning<00:01:33.920> okay<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:34.939> now<00:01:38.649> what<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:39.710> am

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
in the beginning okay so now what I am

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:47.469 
in the beginning okay so now what I am
where<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.789> am<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.359> on<00:01:41.569> my<00:01:41.810> way<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:46.479> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
where I am now is on my way to to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.870 
where I am now is on my way to to
painting<00:01:47.959> in<00:01:48.139> the<00:01:50.859> masses<00:01:51.859> as<00:01:52.549> much<00:01:52.729> as

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
painting in the masses as much as

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.620 
painting in the masses as much as
possible<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.709> very<00:01:55.039> good<00:01:55.310> idea<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:58.630> to

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
possible it's a very good idea to to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.410 
possible it's a very good idea to to
paint<00:01:59.899> back<00:02:00.139> to<00:02:00.350> front

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
paint back to front

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.059 
paint back to front
these<00:02:02.420> darks<00:02:02.869> will<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.289> darker<00:02:03.679> than<00:02:03.709> anything

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
these darks will be darker than anything

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.770 
these darks will be darker than anything
back<00:02:04.429> here<00:02:04.459> because<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.850> will<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.450> an<00:02:08.539> aid

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
back here because that will be an aid

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.490 
back here because that will be an aid
for<00:02:09.729> recession<00:02:11.349> now

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
shapes much darker over here now there's

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.280 
shapes much darker over here now there's
a<00:03:57.570> mountain<00:03:58.170> way<00:03:58.410> over<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.860> that's<00:04:00.290> that's

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
a mountain way over there that's that's

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.560 
a mountain way over there that's that's
really<00:04:01.890> quite<00:04:02.040> blue<00:04:04.460> and<00:04:05.460> it'll<00:04:06.150> give<00:04:06.390> me

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
really quite blue and it'll give me

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:14.290 
really quite blue and it'll give me
another<00:04:06.900> run

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.110 

I'm<00:04:15.300> going<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.780> make<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.990> come<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.880> come<00:04:17.880> down

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I'm going to make it come in come down

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.790 
I'm going to make it come in come down
that<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:18.959> motion<00:04:19.820> moving<00:04:20.820> down<00:04:21.030> toward<00:04:21.480> the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.100 

toward<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.890> focus<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.460> would<00:04:26.850> be<00:04:27.110> is

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
toward the focus I think would be is

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.620 
toward the focus I think would be is
better<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.680> gives<00:04:28.830> me<00:04:28.980> another<00:04:29.630> layer

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
better and it gives me another layer

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.470 
better and it gives me another layer

my<00:04:55.170> teaching<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.950> Colette<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.690> action<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
my teaching is to Colette the action the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:07.280 
my teaching is to Colette the action the
motion<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:01.290> direction<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.780> I'm<00:05:07.050> going<00:05:07.200> to

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
motion the direction and I'm going to

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.130 
motion the direction and I'm going to
make<00:05:07.440> sure<00:05:07.910> that<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.180> dark<00:05:09.480> is<00:05:09.630> dark<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:10.050> the

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
make sure that the dark is dark in the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.590 
make sure that the dark is dark in the
painting<00:05:10.820> he's<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.090> here<00:05:12.300> someplace

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.430 

and<00:05:15.600> then<00:05:16.410> these<00:05:16.620> come<00:05:16.860> up<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.310> sometimes

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
and then these come up and sometimes

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:31.320 
and then these come up and sometimes
actually<00:05:19.440> some<00:05:20.240> branches

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.860 

so<00:05:31.870> we<00:05:31.960> get

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.100 

these<00:05:36.470> greener<00:05:37.210> these<00:05:38.210> yellow<00:05:38.540> or<00:05:38.750> greens<00:05:41.110> in

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
these greener these yellow or greens in

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.690 
these greener these yellow or greens in
the<00:05:42.950> foreground<00:05:43.310> bring<00:05:43.820> things<00:05:44.000> forward

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
the foreground bring things forward

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.950 
the foreground bring things forward
there's<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.760> monastery<00:05:47.120> at<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.600> end<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:47.870> this

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
there's a monastery at the end of this

road that as I say runs out to a
monastery<00:06:00.880> now<00:06:01.880> I'll<00:06:02.060> take<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.390> in<00:06:02.480> the<00:06:02.600> studio

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
monastery now I'll take it in the studio

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.950 
monastery now I'll take it in the studio
and<00:06:03.050> that'll<00:06:03.440> be<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.680> next<00:06:04.630> portion<00:06:05.630> of<00:06:05.870> this

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
and that'll be the next portion of this

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:18.280 
and that'll be the next portion of this
demonstration<00:06:06.320> just<00:06:16.450> want<00:06:17.450> these<00:06:17.690> the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
demonstration just want these the

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.660 
demonstration just want these the
average<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.860> these<00:06:19.870> branches<00:06:21.880> to<00:06:22.880> be<00:06:23.090> more

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
average of these branches to be more

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:31.660 
average of these branches to be more
apparent<00:06:27.070> so<00:06:28.070> that<00:06:28.310> it<00:06:28.970> looks<00:06:29.180> like<00:06:29.420> a<00:06:30.670> tree

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
apparent so that it looks like a tree

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.130 
apparent so that it looks like a tree
with<00:06:31.820> dead<00:06:32.000> branches<00:06:32.420> all<00:06:32.630> over<00:06:32.900> it<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:33.020> I

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
with dead branches all over it and I

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.960 
with dead branches all over it and I
think<00:06:33.380> that<00:06:33.530> does<00:06:33.740> that<00:06:34.600> and<00:06:36.790> still<00:06:37.790> a<00:06:37.820> little

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
think that does that and still a little

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.550 
think that does that and still a little
bit<00:06:38.180> darker<00:06:38.480> but<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.690> can<00:06:38.840> see<00:06:38.990> that<00:06:39.170> this<00:06:39.290> is

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
bit darker but you can see that this is
