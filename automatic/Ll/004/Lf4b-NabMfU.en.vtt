00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.840
 hello everyone I'm coffee and here I bring you 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.030
 a trick of the Indian this king back in the 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.610
 which good I just started a new 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.080
 game to show you what can be done 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.800
 from any moment of the game the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.130
 trick as you see here the missions and everything 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.460
 is 0 and we are going to teach you the trick 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.859
 well we give you to play and how can you 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.259
 check now the missions make us 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.910
 alone you do not need to do for 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.680
 example of collecting 10 gems or 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 good to this guy of the game the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.019
 we have and you will be comfortable as you 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.239
 So it's very simple 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.940
 it turns out that I discovered this 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.010
 accidentally and the weird thing is that it does not 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.260
 has discovered nothing yet 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.809
 well I want to explain it as you see the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.729
 quests acabes canecas I've only done 80 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.299
 meters and are made for it 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:59.780
 we need to have the numeric bread is 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:03.949
 image that you have here and as you see I have just 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.269
 to do mission number 1 to do 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.729
 mission number one continues to press the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.090
 one is done to do the mission number 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.369
 two pulses two and it is also done as 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.850
 You do not need to press all the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.500
 missions 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.200
 we can choose the mission that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.560
 we want and automatically do with 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 the buttons with the 1 the 2 or the 3 also 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.729
 you have to say that you have to have the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.220
 blocking the number of expelled if not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.530
 it works but nothing 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.100
 this is very useful for the people who finish 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.200
 to start and do not want to do all the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.000
 missions or for people who 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.060
 has flown the game that has happened 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 or not I just deleted it and also 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.620
 good that it was lazy to start for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.170
 get money again because here 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.320
 you get objects and those things I can 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.940
 do it to show them and we have not 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.970
 three and you learn many times how I 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.640
 because you stay one if you squeeze five 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.210
 times the number 35 times that you get that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.430
 you have passed it on 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.880
 I said that what good it would have come to me 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.090
 me to see playing tricks but now 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.430
 is already at least now I already know and said 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.109
 this I'm going to show you no new record 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.689
 and here we are this time I have made 71 thousand 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:21.670
 984 meters is not bad as always 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.150
 He killed me because I had to stop them 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.040
 but that also matters is saying that 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.040
 I have put all the video have been opposed 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.599
 just put the moment of the same order 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.689
 so that the video is not long as you see 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.319
 I'm dead here, it does not seem to bet 6 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.170
 well said that said this I mean 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.959
 also that will be my last record not 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.780
 I think I play more because it turns out 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.930
 that the game itself is a bit 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.950
 repetitive I mean that from 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.540
 3000 meters because the speed does not change 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.540
 it's pretty crappy but you can pass 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.120
 twice is more than anything bored 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.909
 who more more time you have at the end 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.099
 ended up making the record and although I 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.659
 They have cost shots and I encourage you 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.000
 make your own record and what 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.510
 surpass and such I will not make more record 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.340
 what would be an endless chain and not us 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.109
 plan so I leave this as a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.220
 definitive record at the moment is the greatest 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.570
 challenge that there is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.720
 and I hope you liked the video 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.010
 that you liked the little that the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.630
 really good 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.630
 and good bye
