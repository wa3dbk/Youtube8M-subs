00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.660 
neutral setting I can now set the lock
to<00:02:22.230> any<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> other<00:02:22.859> seven<00:02:23.370> remaining

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to any of the other seven remaining

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.210 
to any of the other seven remaining
codes<00:02:23.970> again<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.109> demonstration<00:02:25.650> purposes<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
codes again for demonstration purposes I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
codes again for demonstration purposes I
only<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.639> two<00:02:27.209> sets<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.569> keys<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.930> front<00:02:28.049> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
only have two sets of keys in front of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.860 
only have two sets of keys in front of
me<00:02:28.519> so<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.579> will<00:02:29.639> take<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.090> number<00:02:30.329> two<00:02:30.510> change

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
me so I will take the number two change

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.620 
me so I will take the number two change
key<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:33.470> insert<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.650> into<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.099> lock<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.669> will

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
key and insert it into the lock I will

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
key and insert it into the lock I will
insert<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.230> at<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.829> three<00:02:38.069> o'clock<00:02:38.250> position

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
insert it at the three o'clock position

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.309 
insert it at the three o'clock position
so<00:02:39.000> I'm<00:02:39.120> essentially<00:02:39.540> inserting<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.139> key

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
so I'm essentially inserting the key

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.740 
so I'm essentially inserting the key
sideways<00:02:40.889> or<00:02:41.370> 90<00:02:41.790> degrees<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.329> right<00:02:42.359> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
sideways or 90 degrees to the right and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.319 
sideways or 90 degrees to the right and
I<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.380> turn<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.709> lock<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.000> empty

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
I will turn the lock so that the empty

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.199 
I will turn the lock so that the empty
space<00:02:45.660> or<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.410> gap<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.130> pins<00:02:47.370> goes<00:02:48.000> from

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
space or the gap in the pins goes from

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.569 
space or the gap in the pins goes from
the<00:02:48.329> three<00:02:48.540> o'clock<00:02:48.720> position<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> 12

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the three o'clock position to the 12

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:58.720 
the three o'clock position to the 12
o'clock<00:02:50.669> position

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.250 

you<00:02:59.730> will<00:02:59.819> now<00:02:59.939> see<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.360> gap<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:01.049> 12

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
you will now see this gap is at 12

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.850 
you will now see this gap is at 12
o'clock<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:03.269> means<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:04.019> now<00:03:04.200> set<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
o'clock that means I have now set the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.679 
o'clock that means I have now set the
lock<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> number<00:03:06.120> two<00:03:06.360> white<00:03:07.019> combination

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
lock to the number two white combination

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.160 
lock to the number two white combination
the<00:03:09.689> number<00:03:09.989> two<00:03:10.170> white<00:03:10.439> key<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:12.569> now<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.900> new

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the number two white key is now the new

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
key which was lost or stolen is now

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.420 
key which was lost or stolen is now
locked<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.159> of<00:03:23.189> the<00:03:23.400> system<00:03:27.620> again<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.220> white

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.500 
key is now the new operating key once
I've<00:03:36.420> changed<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.549> specific<00:03:39.060> code<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.389> this

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
I've changed to a specific code in this

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.920 
I've changed to a specific code in this
case<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> white<00:03:40.079> code<00:03:40.349> I<00:03:41.209> can<00:03:42.209> change<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.780> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
case the white code I can change it to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.319 
case the white code I can change it to
any<00:03:43.139> other<00:03:43.290> code<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.889> lock<00:03:44.069> including<00:03:45.000> the

any other code in the lock including the
red<00:03:45.540> code<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.079> just<00:03:46.439> changed<00:03:46.889> from<00:03:47.189> I<00:03:48.200> will

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
red code that I just changed from I will

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.949 
red code that I just changed from I will
make<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.459> change<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:51.659> see<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
make that change so that you can see the

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.099 
make that change so that you can see the
system<00:03:52.200> perform<00:03:53.040> again<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.849> to<00:03:54.510> provide<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
few hints and tips for the change

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.339 
few hints and tips for the change
process<00:03:59.000> I'm<00:04:00.000> now<00:04:00.269> keep<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.810> mind<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:01.169> the

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
process I'm now keep in mind on the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.619 
process I'm now keep in mind on the
white<00:04:01.530> number<00:04:01.799> two<00:04:02.010> setting<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.329> will<00:04:03.480> take

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
white number two setting so I will take

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.460 
white number two setting so I will take
my<00:04:03.870> black<00:04:04.290> number<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.250> change<00:04:05.669> key<00:04:06.349> put<00:04:07.349> it

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
my black number to change key put it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.420 
my black number to change key put it
into<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.829> lock<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.370> turn<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.389> a<00:04:09.569> quarter<00:04:09.840> turn
