00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 when connecting it to the pc 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 we select 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.450
 the file is called sgs 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.439
 and we will pass it on 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.050
 to our memory the root as they see already what 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.380
 I have here 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.490
 to make more reality 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.150
 good thanks we had it disconnected 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.150
 our phone 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.680
 we are going to pay for entering into recovery 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.680
 incoming 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.520
 this one in particular is very fast has 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.890
 good operation is used 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 bring the applications back further then 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:15.239
 it's good 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.239
 we press the home button and the button 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 we wait 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.380
 and as beautiful health 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.960
 first to install 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.780
 the ruin we have to make a white 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.690
 datafactory preset we move with 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.540
 the volume keys we select good 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.120
 data factor and being 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 one click with the home button 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.069
 we select is yes 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.710
 we wait 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.870
 and it is already 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.870
 we make a white cachet partition 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 and then we're going to advance 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 and we make a white white darling h 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.950
 Indian 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.370
 we go back with the key 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.390
 and we select 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.980
 be without forecasting 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.400
 press a home key 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.909
 choose meant 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.710
 and we look for our file in this 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.860
 case is the axis s 2 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.450
 we select it and we hope we'll say 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.370
 yes 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.370
 and now we wait for it to end 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.489
 It's fast, it does not take long 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.530
 and as I said this but very good 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.390
 above 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.720
 it's the best I've tasted 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.670
 I recommend 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.670
 even though all the animation of the so2 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.050
 I'm going to leave all the files 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.900
 needed to do this in the 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.199
 description can let in better 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.449
 the file to root and the file 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.449
 of the issue that we are installing 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.450
 it takes like 2 minutes 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.450
 in settling 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.220
 in what does the formatting of all the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.220
 zone 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.640
 subscribe to the channel have like 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.650
 Any doubt or comment clarification 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.220
 message 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.220
 twitter 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.960
 that is, it ends 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.370
 we go 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.800
 and we are still waiting 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.160
 Work as 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:46.100
 already tells us of tone 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:51.370
 and the from being fulfilled now we're going 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.370
 back we press system 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
 good 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.190
 starting 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.340
 the animation 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.170
 the first time we started with this 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.500
 with any course we will use 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.500
 late 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.919
 and five minutes since it's the first boot 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:32.830
 what it does and therefore has to load 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.830
 all the data and applications and 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.520
 configure the entire environment 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.319
 that we have that has 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.319
 as they see only the animation of the light 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.310
 let's say they are laws 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.969
 I'm going for him I'm going to cut the video and 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.199
 then power 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.199
 I'm starting out 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.129
 good and at the beginning we get what is 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.190
 the configuration of 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:08.810
 of gps right now we will not do anything 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.810
 then I'm going to show you that I'm already 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.270
 here is your run 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:22.940
 with the coast in run of the galaxy s2 like 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:28.550
 come is realistically influenced this brings by 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:31.270
 defect the gingerbread 2.3 points 70 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.270
 Mr. 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:41.160
 if they say 4 points 0.3 is not the 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.530
 original is simply an error of 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.420
 execution there the developers with the 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.690

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.680
 it is very fluid 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.599
 I already have some applications and then I 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.240
 upload the previous one you have installed the 

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:02.050
