00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello people here I show you today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.349
 my first video 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.160
 It's a how to video as you are 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 a good train capable 600 euro pc 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.369
 can put together because the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.400
 Most of you count in big 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.519
 facts and figures 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 Remember like saturn or mediamarkt 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 somehow it could be found for 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.800
 600 euro pretty much bullshit to gamble 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.250
 there are once three terabytes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 hard disks or 1 706 and euro 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 no pig needs a good start 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.610
 with the amd fx 6100 whose six-core 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 with three factors for the socket am3 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.590
 Plus and it will be pretty cheap too 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.780
 So you could still the x4 965 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.409
 black edition take even more for 20 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 less 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.170
 but that comes because quotes 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 only with four cores and you can see it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 even that crysis 3 for example what you do 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 could also gamble with this pc too 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 little on highest settings though 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 on medium to high that's just 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:35.210
 my guess that this is crysis 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 3 old more gratefully accepting cores 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.659
 and yes it has moved in the 32 nanometer 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.790
 so not made in the very latest 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.720
 so logically now 64 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.310
 bit processor 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.630
 that is the least we do 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.229
 continue with the graphics card 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 this is an asus hd 78 70 by co2 in 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.159
 the top version is still the version 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:07.630
 without top but not top version for 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.780
 this is available for 218 the 22 euros 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.819
 yes this is honest same card only 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.140
 that they are not so strong at the factory 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.540
 overclocked s resp 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 not that then only the better 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.910
 But it really is cooler 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 extremely good and gets the graphics card 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.750
 pretty to very cool and this is 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 the card is also very quiet 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.349
 So this cooler is also on the 680th 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.180
 from asus to the 670 installed in the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.440
 sexta may have a staircase slot design 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.390
 So four slots thick but there you see 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.010
 it is also very cool the web that is the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.769
 coast graphic card in the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.880
 It continues with the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.040
 housing aero coop vs 3 advanced 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.500
 yes I do not know any real brand goods 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.569
 how cool master but what do you want for 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 Expect 36 euros is a reasonable 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.269
 housing is well ventilated it is not 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.230
 the most attractive case but it is 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.440
 are also not as ugly stop here 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:23.500
 Two USB 3.0 ports headphones and 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:27.130
 start the microphone reboot and here the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 disk inserts sorry the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.170
 drive insertions now we come to 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.739
 hard drive that is a seagate 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.049
 Barracuda with a terabyte memory 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.880
 this is personally my favorites because 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:45.870
 she is pretty fast for her 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.470
 extremely low price of 60 euro so 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.260
 compared to 500 gb hard disks for 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.930
 the same price is the ever 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.510
 quite apart from the one to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.280
 it is already storage capacity 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.770
 partly faster despite the higher 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.450
 memory 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:11.250
 Now we come to the frame that is the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:18.120
 8gb scale with 1600 megahertz so packs 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:20.020
 50 euro it's just what you have so 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.290
 There is nothing more 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.290
 accept 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.540
 the next one is the first one 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.640
 mainboard astrid 79 extreme three even 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.940
 by way of the 1 3 plus socket the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.110
 also here is suitable to the processor 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.720
 an atx format the maximum what synonymous in the 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.590
 housing used by me what that 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.280
 housing exactly that is supported halt 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.240
 as I said only a 3+ socket 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:59.970
 There are a lot of bars here and here 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:05.170
 you can see the s2 pci express slots out there 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.700
 this express 3 with the possibility one 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.530
 3 city map 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.990
 I have a second ticket here now 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.920
 selected so synonymous sli friendly 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.370
 if you have another second than 78 70 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.680
 want to do it because it's easy 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.500
 better here because if you have two slots 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.360
 turns one then remains free and the 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.290
 Cooling performance once better so that will 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:39.130
 meanwhile hot there are so to speak the 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:41.620
 usb 3 0 2 0 3 is clearly a drive 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.070
 I find it unnecessary but there you have it 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.780
 but sometimes with cd or always missing 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.790
 Why do not you look up? 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.540
 watching TV is one 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.320
 another question 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.880
 or would like for 13 euros should that 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.820
 Do you imagine what's more you need 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.510
 I do not think so 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.900
 Last but not least, be quiet power 34 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:09.730
 watt power supply 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.260
 yes it has a pretty good one so fast 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.770
 It also has a very high performance 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.710
 efficiency 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.470
 Here you can see the einstein moderate 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.819
 usually 12 12 millimeters centimeters 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:26.569
 fan and friend of mine used this 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:29.180
 also this power supply and is with it 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:33.759
 fairly satisfied has also film award 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:39.370
 from 56 euro highly recommended 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:42.080
 yes that was my about 600 euro pc 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.490
 I'll be glad if next time 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.300
 turns back on will turn on 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.430
 if and if something does not fit if 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.470
 you can find something worthy of improvement 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.750
 write me the comments 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.250
 I know first video it will not 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.680
 many people see but i know 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.780
 somebody will always comment on it 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.740
 the flame is because i'm shit because 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.539
 i shit talking or something last 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.440
 I know that right now 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:12.490
 but whoever youtube does must also 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:19.180
 expect it well 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:19.180
 thank you and see you next time
