00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.500 

 I<00:00:01.639> thought<00:00:02.639> I'd<00:00:02.760> show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.090> simple<00:00:03.360> way

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
 I thought I'd show you a simple way

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.150 
 I thought I'd show you a simple way
to<00:00:03.659> install<00:00:04.020> bearings<00:00:04.529> while<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:04.830> was<00:00:05.040> getting

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
to install bearings while I was getting

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.130 
to install bearings while I was getting
the<00:00:05.279> scooter<00:00:05.700> engine<00:00:05.940> together<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.509> need<00:00:06.930> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the scooter engine together I need to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.770 
the scooter engine together I need to
install<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.919> bearing<00:00:08.340> here<00:00:08.730> into<00:00:09.660> this

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
install this bearing here into this

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.620 
install this bearing here into this
minerally<00:00:10.349> case<00:00:11.870> all<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.259> need<00:00:14.599> is<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
minerally case all you really need is a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.760 
minerally case all you really need is a
bolt<00:00:16.130> that'll<00:00:17.130> fit<00:00:17.279> through<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> bearing<00:00:18.770> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
bolt that'll fit through the bearing and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.870 
bolt that'll fit through the bearing and
that<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> course<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.970> fits<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> bolt<00:00:22.880> then

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
that of course that fits the bolt then

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480 
that of course that fits the bolt then
you'll<00:00:24.119> need<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.600> washer<00:00:25.109> that's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> little

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you'll need one washer that's a little

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.029 
you'll need one washer that's a little
smaller<00:00:26.880> than<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> diameter<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.680> bearing

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
smaller than the diameter of the bearing

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.959 
smaller than the diameter of the bearing
just<00:00:29.939> slightly<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.949> then<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.279> washer<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
just slightly and then one washer that

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.530 
just slightly and then one washer that
is<00:00:33.149> larger<00:00:34.010> than<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> bearing<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.360> want

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is larger than the bearing so you want

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.030 
is larger than the bearing so you want
to<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.170> course<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> make<00:00:40.710> sure<00:00:40.890> all

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to start out of course you make sure all

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
to start out of course you make sure all
your<00:00:41.219> surfaces<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.850> clean<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> bearings

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
your surfaces are clean the bearings

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.690 
your surfaces are clean the bearings
clean<00:00:43.040> everything<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
clean everything like that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
clean everything like that
and<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.510> place<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.719> bearing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and then you can just place the bearing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then you can just place the bearing
in<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.710> pressure<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.129> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in there and put a little pressure on it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.939 
in there and put a little pressure on it
by<00:00:50.430> hand<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.170> should<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.469> able<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
by hand you should be able to get it to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
by hand you should be able to get it to
just<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> sit<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.730> place<00:00:54.710> when<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> press

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just kind of sit in place when you press

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.319 
just kind of sit in place when you press
it<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.030> it's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it in you just want to make sure it's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
it in you just want to make sure it's
even<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.649> know<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.949> side

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
even so you don't have you know one side

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.410 
even so you don't have you know one side
sticking<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.820> more<00:01:00.030> than<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> other

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
sticking out way more than the other

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.490 
sticking out way more than the other
you're<00:01:00.570> trying<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:00.960> sure<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> gets<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you're trying to make sure it gets in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.720 
you're trying to make sure it gets in
there<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.710> straight<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.070> possible

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there as straight as possible

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
there as straight as possible
and<00:01:03.570> once<00:01:03.750> you've<00:01:03.870> got<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> evened<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.100> put

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and once you've got it evened up you put

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.160 
and once you've got it evened up you put
your<00:01:05.339> larger<00:01:06.000> washer<00:01:06.799> over<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> bolt<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.170> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
your larger washer over the bolt and in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
your larger washer over the bolt and in
this<00:01:10.260> case<00:01:10.500> it'll<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:10.860> through<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.189> side

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this case it'll go through this side

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.609 
this case it'll go through this side
because<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.090> pulling<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> bearing<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because we're pulling the bearing this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.990 
because we're pulling the bearing this
way<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:15.380> then<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> smaller<00:01:16.799> washer<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
way and then the smaller washer of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
way and then the smaller washer of
course<00:01:18.240> goes<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.750> then

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
course goes on the other side and then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
course goes on the other side and then
you<00:01:22.320> start<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> nut<00:01:23.810> you'll<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.049> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you start the nut you'll want to be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
you start the nut you'll want to be
careful<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.770> you're<00:01:26.000> putting<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.090> together

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
careful when you're putting it together

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
careful when you're putting it together
to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.600> sure<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> washer<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.579> pretty

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to make sure the the washer is pretty

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.690 
to make sure the the washer is pretty
much<00:01:29.970> centered<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> bearing<00:01:31.549> once<00:01:32.549> you've

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
much centered on the bearing once you've

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
much centered on the bearing once you've
got<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> nut<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> bolt<00:01:33.689> hand<00:01:34.560> tight<00:01:34.860> then

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
got the nut in the bolt hand tight then

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
got the nut in the bolt hand tight then
you<00:01:35.189> doesn't<00:01:35.430> need<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> wrench<00:01:35.820> or<00:01:36.030> socket<00:01:36.210> or

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you doesn't need a wrench or socket or

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.700 
you doesn't need a wrench or socket or
whatever<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> prefer<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.530> each<00:01:37.710> side<00:01:38.270> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
whatever you prefer for each side and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
whatever you prefer for each side and
then<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:41.189> tightening<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
then just start tightening it up and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
then just start tightening it up and
you'll<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> press<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> bearing<00:01:43.590> into

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you'll see a press of the bearing into

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.990 
you'll see a press of the bearing into
place

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.880 

and<00:01:47.690> if<00:01:47.840> you're<00:01:47.960> doing<00:01:48.080> something<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.560> this

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
and if you're doing something like this

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.190 
and if you're doing something like this
one<00:01:49.210> you've<00:01:50.210> got<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.480> make<00:01:50.630> sure<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.870> keep<00:01:51.020> an

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
one you've got to make sure you keep an

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.500 
one you've got to make sure you keep an
eye<00:01:51.320> on<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.830> be<00:01:52.520> sure<00:01:52.730> your<00:01:52.880> washer<00:01:53.270> isn't

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
eye on it to be sure your washer isn't

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.880 
eye on it to be sure your washer isn't
gonna<00:01:53.660> run<00:01:53.840> into<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.110> case<00:01:54.320> or<00:01:54.650> whatever
