then I got the footage from that iphone

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
then I got the footage from that iphone
as<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.750> only<00:01:49.079> about<00:01:49.560> 30<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
as well this one only about 30 or so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
as well this one only about 30 or so
seconds<00:01:50.790> maybe<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.390> less<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.159> can

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
seconds maybe a little less and you can

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.170 
seconds maybe a little less and you can
see<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.060> totally<00:01:54.829> busted<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> think

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
see it's just totally busted and I think

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
see it's just totally busted and I think
the<00:01:57.240> major<00:01:57.420> reason<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.320> concerned<00:01:58.829> wise

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the major reason are concerned wise

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
the major reason are concerned wise
there's<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.850> line<00:02:00.509> right<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there's this line right here and it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.429 
there's this line right here and it
almost<00:02:01.530> opens<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
almost opens up and I think all the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.830 
almost opens up and I think all the
gasoline<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.100> water<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.700> seeped<00:02:06.090> right

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
gasoline and water just seeped right

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.820 
gasoline and water just seeped right
into<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:08.209> into<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.539> area<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
into that into that little area so that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.410 
into that into that little area so that
corrupted<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.730> we're<00:02:11.849> actually<00:02:12.060> going

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
corrupted so what we're actually going

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.440 
corrupted so what we're actually going
to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.629> is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
to do is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.070 
to do is
because<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.879> these<00:02:16.420> results<00:02:16.629> we're<00:02:16.930> just
