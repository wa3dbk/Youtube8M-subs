00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.890
 on the bike so she falls down the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 meaning we do not care then you go 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.540
 back in the van and you 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.770

 and to align yourself really needs that the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.550
 newspaper is well placed on the bike 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.750

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.610
 foot there in your garage you go 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.870
