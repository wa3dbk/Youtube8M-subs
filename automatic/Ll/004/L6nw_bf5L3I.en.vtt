00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
going to show you how to griddle a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.279 
going to show you how to griddle a
zucchini<00:00:19.380> my<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.640> tip<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:21.990> cut

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
zucchini my first tip is I like to cut

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.570 
zucchini my first tip is I like to cut
them<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> angle<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.490> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
them on the angle because I think it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.880 
them on the angle because I think it
makes<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.269> more<00:00:24.449> interesting

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
makes them look a bit more interesting

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
makes them look a bit more interesting
now<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.269> cut<00:00:27.420> them<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
now you can just cut them as a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
now you can just cut them as a
straightforward<00:00:28.050> disc<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.640> would<00:00:29.760> be

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
straightforward disc so it would be

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.760 
straightforward disc so it would be
flash<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.900> 90<00:00:31.289> degrees<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:34.290> next<00:00:34.590> thing<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
flash at 90 degrees the next thing is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
flash at 90 degrees the next thing is
just<00:00:35.579> lay<00:00:35.790> them<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> griddle<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
just lay them on the griddle now the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.860 
just lay them on the griddle now the
interesting<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.559> about<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.100> griddle<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
interesting thing about this griddle is

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
interesting thing about this griddle is
I've<00:00:39.870> had<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.790> about<00:00:42.050> 10

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
I've had it on the go for about 10

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
I've had it on the go for about 10
minutes<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.590> there's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> ferocious<00:00:44.640> heat

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
minutes so there's a ferocious heat

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.470 
minutes so there's a ferocious heat
coming<00:00:45.300> from<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:47.030> whenever<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.270> cook

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
coming from it and whenever you cook

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
coming from it and whenever you cook
with<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> griddle<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.469> ever<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:50.100> fat<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.789> oil

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
with a griddle don't ever put fat or oil

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
with a griddle don't ever put fat or oil
onto<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> griddle<00:00:52.140> pan<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.680> doesn't<00:00:53.010> need<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
onto the griddle pan it doesn't need it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
onto the griddle pan it doesn't need it
it<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.910> burn<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.870> end<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it will burn it will end up in there and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
it will burn it will end up in there and
whatever<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.219> end<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.610> cooking<00:00:57.239> will<00:00:57.809> also

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
whatever you end up cooking will also

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.880 
whatever you end up cooking will also
burn<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> record<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.940> 45<00:01:00.870> seconds<00:01:01.469> every

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
burn now I record about 45 seconds every

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
burn now I record about 45 seconds every
time<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> turn<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> cause<00:01:02.910> yet<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.660> i'm

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
time you turn the cause yet and i'm

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
time you turn the cause yet and i'm
going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> turn<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.350> four<00:01:04.619> times<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:05.309> on

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to turn them four times two on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
going to turn them four times two on
each<00:01:05.610> side<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> reason<00:01:07.650> i'm<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
each side and the reason i'm going to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
each side and the reason i'm going to
turn<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.030> i<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> have

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
turn them is because i want them to have

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.010 
turn them is because i want them to have
a<00:01:10.049> nice<00:01:10.409> latticed<00:01:11.250> happy<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.960> turn

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
a nice latticed happy so if I now turn

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
a nice latticed happy so if I now turn
that<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.619> 90<00:01:14.010> degrees<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.920> end<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.310> with

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that by 90 degrees will end up with

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
that by 90 degrees will end up with
exactly<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.900> you'll<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> mean

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
exactly that now you'll see what I mean

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
exactly that now you'll see what I mean
in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> minute<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.970> turn<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.540> round

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
in a minute when I turn them back round

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
in a minute when I turn them back round
but<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:22.770> always<00:01:22.920> said<00:01:23.810> 10<00:01:24.810> 25<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.619> 5<00:01:26.460> past

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
but I've always said 10 25 and 5 past

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
but I've always said 10 25 and 5 past
seven<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> griddle<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> clock<00:01:29.430> face

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
seven if the griddle was a clock face

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.999 
seven if the griddle was a clock face
and<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.720> turn<00:01:30.780> these<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.259> i'm<00:01:31.829> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and if I now turn these around i'm just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.230 
and if I now turn these around i'm just
giving<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.210> but

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
giving them a little bit more time but

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
giving them a little bit more time but
if<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> turn<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.020> around<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.829> should

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
if I turn them around we should

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.640 
if I turn them around we should
ultimately<00:01:35.220> end<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:37.020> exactly<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.530> I'm

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
ultimately end up but exactly what I'm

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
ultimately end up but exactly what I'm
looking<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
looking for which I have there which is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
looking for which I have there which is
that<00:01:40.170> nice<00:01:40.430> lattest<00:01:41.450> griddle<00:01:42.450> pattern

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that nice lattest griddle pattern

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990 
that nice lattest griddle pattern
going<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.760> turn<00:01:45.939> those<00:01:46.150> over<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.250> because

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
going to turn those over and because

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.149 
going to turn those over and because
it's<00:01:49.180> been<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.479> there<00:01:49.720> for<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.080> long<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.619> can

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
it's been on there for so long I can

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.830 
it's been on there for so long I can
almost<00:01:51.310> get<00:01:51.670> away<00:01:51.909> with<00:01:52.119> just<00:01:52.240> turning<00:01:52.720> those

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
almost get away with just turning those

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.240 
almost get away with just turning those
around<00:01:53.200> now<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:56.049> having<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.380> wait<00:01:56.619> quite<00:01:56.950> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
around now not having to wait quite so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.770 
around now not having to wait quite so
long<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.710> then<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> final<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.750> goes<00:02:01.750> over

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
long and then the final one goes over

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.930 
long and then the final one goes over
there<00:02:02.350> what<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.520> now<00:02:03.700> do<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.920> I'd<00:02:06.369> like<00:02:06.759> to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
there what I can now do is I'd like to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.729 
there what I can now do is I'd like to
