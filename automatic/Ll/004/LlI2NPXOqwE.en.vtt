00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.690 
actually having to be Center how far
away<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> center<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
away from them from the center this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
away from them from the center this
relative<00:02:00.119> light<00:02:00.299> makes<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> really<00:02:01.229> easy

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
relative light makes it really easy

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.830 
relative light makes it really easy
directional<00:02:02.220> arrows<00:02:02.539> they're<00:02:03.539> all<00:02:03.659> about

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
directional arrows they're all about

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
directional arrows they're all about
horizontal<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.039> this<00:02:05.189> tour

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
horizontal of them that's what this tour

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.229 
horizontal of them that's what this tour
is<00:02:05.700> used<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.420> yeah<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.759> cool<00:02:09.000> feature

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
is used for yeah the really cool feature

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.400 
is used for yeah the really cool feature
so<00:02:09.929> does<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.599> plug<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so does this have like you plug in the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.559 
so does this have like you plug in the
grade<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.890> do<00:02:13.980> all<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.340> exactly<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.420> they're

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
grade and do all that exactly so they're

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.690 
grade and do all that exactly so they're
really<00:02:16.170> nice<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.680> bosses<00:02:17.220> finally<00:02:17.580> has<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
really nice it bosses finally has a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910 
really nice it bosses finally has a
rotary<00:02:18.360> laser<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.870> slope<00:02:19.140> I'll<00:02:19.560> grab<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.769> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
rotary laser with slope I'll grab it a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
rotary laser with slope I'll grab it a
digital<00:02:20.130> dialing<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.780> plus<00:02:22.080> or

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
digital dialing so I can do plus or

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.910 
digital dialing so I can do plus or
minus<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.340> 10%<00:02:23.550> okay<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.799> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
minus up to 10% okay but really what is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.039 
minus up to 10% okay but really what is
amazing<00:02:26.190> about<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.360> once<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.840> set

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
amazing about this is that once you set

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.140 
amazing about this is that once you set
the<00:02:28.110> percentage<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:29.310> automatic<00:02:29.940> self

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the percentage it's automatic self

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.630 
the percentage it's automatic self
leveling<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:31.140> unlike<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> manual<00:02:32.040> self

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
leveling so unlike a manual self

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.580 
leveling so unlike a manual self

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
first one I talked about the anti-theft

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.160 
first one I talked about the anti-theft
device<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.880> nice<00:03:33.060> feature<00:03:33.389> provide

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
device it's a nice feature provide

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.900 
device it's a nice feature provide
safety<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.680> comfort<00:03:34.859> but<00:03:35.639> when<00:03:35.790> you're

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
safety and comfort but when you're

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780 
safety and comfort but when you're
talking<00:03:36.209> about<00:03:36.299> going<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.989> 1650<00:03:37.889> feet<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.720 
sixteenth inch
accuracy<00:03:40.320> yeah<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:41.070> need<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.250> make<00:03:41.460> sure<00:03:41.580> that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
accuracy yeah you need to make sure that

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.700 
accuracy yeah you need to make sure that
accuracy<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.390> always<00:03:42.720> there<00:03:42.930> then<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.530> last

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
accuracy is always there then the last

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.140 
accuracy is always there then the last
thing<00:03:43.890> we<00:03:44.010> have<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.280> calibration<00:03:44.790> guard

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
thing we have is a calibration guard

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.970 
thing we have is a calibration guard
again<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.930> little<00:03:46.140> icon<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> comes<00:03:46.830> up

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
again it's a little icon that comes up

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.890 
again it's a little icon that comes up

that lets you know that you need to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.840 
that lets you know that you need to
check<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.350> tool<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.190> sometimes<00:03:50.640> these<00:03:50.790> things

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
check the tool so sometimes these things

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.480 
check the tool so sometimes these things
drop<00:03:51.380> extreme<00:03:52.380> environments<00:03:52.950> hot<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.280> cold

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
drop extreme environments hot and cold

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.790 
drop extreme environments hot and cold
or<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.690> been<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.020> use<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.410> year

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
or it's been in use for a year

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.500 
or it's been in use for a year

all these things naturally occur in the
environment<00:03:58.020> which<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.320> used<00:03:59.210> once

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
environment which that are used once

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.700 
environment which that are used once
again<00:04:00.450> provides<00:04:00.780> peace<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.170> mind<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> user
