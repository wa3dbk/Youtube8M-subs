reason why I'm still kind of i'm still
not<00:01:49.680> too<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:50.189> about<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.920> excuses<00:01:52.920> i<00:01:53.100> was

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
not too sure about the excuses i was

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
not too sure about the excuses i was
giving<00:01:53.640> arm<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.390> saying<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
giving arm and I was saying could

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.780 
giving arm and I was saying could
actually<00:01:54.899> did<00:01:55.170> some<00:01:55.380> research<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> I'm

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
actually did some research on it I'm

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.360 
actually did some research on it I'm
still<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.450> too<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.140> um

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
still not too sure about um

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.030 
still not too sure about um
I<00:01:59.720> guess<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.900> could<00:02:01.080> be<00:02:01.110> plausible<00:02:01.410> but<00:02:01.860> I'm

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
I guess it could be plausible but I'm

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.670 
I guess it could be plausible but I'm
not<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.690> thing<00:02:03.930> people<00:02:03.960> telling<00:02:04.590> me

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
not sure so the thing people telling me

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.830 
not sure so the thing people telling me
was<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.640> PlayStation<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.420> built<00:02:06.690> on

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
was you know the PlayStation is built on

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
was you know the PlayStation is built on
a<00:02:06.900> different<00:02:07.380> architects<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.490> no<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.420> doing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

fingers on architect architecture
architecture<00:02:15.360> architecture<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.350> know

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
architecture architecture so you know

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.530 
architecture architecture so you know
the<00:02:19.800> playstation<00:02:20.280> 3<00:02:20.460> use<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> whole<00:02:20.970> 6-cell

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the playstation 3 use the whole 6-cell

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.110 
the playstation 3 use the whole 6-cell
core<00:02:21.930> thing<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.290> whatever<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.120> the

core thing or whatever and the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
core thing or whatever and the
playstation<00:02:24.810> 4<00:02:25.050> doesn't<00:02:25.440> use<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.770> same

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
playstation 4 doesn't use that same

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.940 
playstation 4 doesn't use that same
processing<00:02:26.730> power<00:02:26.910> or<00:02:27.120> processor

processing power or processor

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.350 
processing power or processor
architecture<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.000> being<00:02:30.210> said

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
architecture so with that being said

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
architecture so with that being said
they<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.810> saying<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:32.460> will<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.820> be<00:02:33.030> able

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
they are saying that it will not be able

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.250 
they are saying that it will not be able
to<00:02:33.360> emulate<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:36.210> know<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> ps3<00:02:37.020> games

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to emulate the you know the ps3 games

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.660 
to emulate the you know the ps3 games
because<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:37.830> using<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.130> same<00:02:38.370> process

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
because it's not using that same process

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
because it's not using that same process
but<00:02:39.090> then<00:02:39.240> I'm<00:02:39.390> looking<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> like<00:02:39.990> well<00:02:40.230> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
but then I'm looking at it like well you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.310 
but then I'm looking at it like well you
know<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.880> ticket<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:42.780> example

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
know you can get a ticket for example

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.930 
know you can get a ticket for example

that and that all live thing but there
was<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:04.519> similarity<00:04:05.519> with<00:04:05.760> both<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:05.970> those

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
was a a similarity with both of those

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.270 
was a a similarity with both of those
systems<00:04:06.630> they<00:04:06.930> all<00:04:07.140> failed

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
systems they all failed

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.210 
systems they all failed
it<00:04:09.030> lasts<00:04:09.390> long<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.800> see<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.040> with

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
actually talking about it like there

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.479 
actually talking about it like there
were<00:04:16.079> four<00:04:16.410> words<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.709> things<00:04:16.799> discussing<00:04:17.400> it

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
were four words and things discussing it

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.039 
were four words and things discussing it
and<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.389> articles<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.019> things

like<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.940> might<00:04:21.180> work<00:04:21.209> for<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:22.079> lot<00:04:22.530> of<00:04:22.560> us

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
like that it might work for a lot of us

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.620 
like that it might work for a lot of us
in<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.040> US<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.820> there's<00:04:24.060> people<00:04:24.480> in

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
in the US but then there's people in

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.070 
in the US but then there's people in
other<00:04:24.870> countries<00:04:25.169> who<00:04:25.710> whose<00:04:26.720> cable<00:04:27.720> company

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
other countries who whose cable company

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.590 
other countries who whose cable company
still<00:04:28.290> run<00:04:28.590> narrow<00:04:28.889> brands<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:30.090> instead<00:04:30.540> of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
still run narrow brands on instead of

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.840 
still run narrow brands on instead of
broadband<00:04:31.190> so<00:04:32.190> let's<00:04:32.370> do<00:04:32.460> them<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.669> narrow

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
broadband so let's do them on a narrow

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.909 
broadband so let's do them on a narrow
band<00:04:33.090> over<00:04:33.450> there<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.410> lot<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.590> them<00:04:34.770> are

band over there and a lot of them are

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.760 
band over there and a lot of them are

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
think about it even if your connection

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.100 
think about it even if your connection
is<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:56.940> I'm<00:04:57.030> going<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.180> save<00:04:57.390> us<00:04:57.419> say<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.870> get

is so I'm going to save us say you get

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.110 
is so I'm going to save us say you get
five<00:04:58.290> or<00:04:58.320> six<00:04:58.620> mix<00:04:58.860> let's<00:04:59.669> say<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.880> get<00:05:00.060> a

going to be led it's not going to be too

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.650 
going to be led it's not going to be too
great<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.310> system<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:12.000> plus<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.419> got<00:05:12.570> to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
great of a system and plus you got to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.719 
great of a system and plus you got to
pay<00:05:12.810> for<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:13.290> really<00:05:13.830> still<00:05:14.040> see<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:14.490> a

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
pay for it I really still see it as a

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.670 
pay for it I really still see it as a
way<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.270> slowly<00:05:15.540> can<00:05:15.750> get<00:05:15.900> more<00:05:16.020> money<00:05:16.229> out<00:05:16.380> you

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
way to slowly can get more money out you
