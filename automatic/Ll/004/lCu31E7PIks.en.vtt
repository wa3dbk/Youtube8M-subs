would be good storage bins something

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.420 
would be good storage bins something
like<00:00:53.490> that<00:00:53.700> something<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> be

like that something that's going to be

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.240 
like that something that's going to be
tight<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> seal<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.740> is<00:00:58.920> ideal

the hole is a little tight you can use a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.389 
the hole is a little tight you can use a
file<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.749> utility<00:01:34.469> blade<00:01:34.679> to<00:01:34.859> scrape<00:01:35.009> off<00:01:35.369> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
stuff that's kind of got a little

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.150 
stuff that's kind of got a little
adhesive<00:02:38.460> on<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.590> basically<00:02:40.710> do

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
adhesive on it so what you basically do

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.100 
adhesive on it so what you basically do
is<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.550> take<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.270> plumber's<00:02:42.570> tape<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.990> the

is just take the plumber's tape on the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.830 
is just take the plumber's tape on the
thread<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.820> start<00:02:45.030> at<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> end<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
thread and you can start at the end you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.790 
thread and you can start at the end you
can<00:02:45.990> start<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> inside<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.420> just

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
can start on the inside and you just

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.680 
can start on the inside and you just
wrap<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.790> seals<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.450> more

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
wrap it this just seals it up more

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.200 
wrap it this just seals it up more
further<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.790> actually<00:02:53.940> are

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
further so when you actually are

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.130 
further so when you actually are
twisting<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.780> inside<00:02:55.260> here<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.810> plumbers

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
twisting this inside here the plumbers

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.080 
twisting this inside here the plumbers
tape<00:02:58.290> gives<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.040> little<00:02:59.160> bit<00:02:59.340> extra<00:03:00.710> seal

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
tape gives it a little bit extra seal

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.640 
tape gives it a little bit extra seal
inside<00:03:03.090> here<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.360> grab<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.020> plumbers<00:03:04.380> putty

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
inside here and grab the plumbers putty

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.740 
inside here and grab the plumbers putty
and<00:03:04.800> smear<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> good<00:03:05.670> amount<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.270> underside

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
and smear a good amount on the underside

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.690 
and smear a good amount on the underside
of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.960> valve<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.220> help<00:03:08.340> make<00:03:08.550> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
of the valve this will help make the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.240 
of the valve this will help make the
seal<00:03:08.940> tight<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.750> jug<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.770> now<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.220> just

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
seal tight on the jug so now we can just

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.230 
seal tight on the jug so now we can just
screw<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:13.970> we're<00:03:14.970> just<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.210> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
screw this on and we're just going to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.570 
screw this on and we're just going to
kind<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.890> lightly<00:03:16.890> screw<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.340> then

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
kind of like lightly screw it and then

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.810 
kind of like lightly screw it and then
we'll<00:03:17.700> we'll<00:03:18.120> take<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.860> wrench<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.340> actually

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
we'll we'll take the wrench and actually

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.330 
we'll we'll take the wrench and actually
put<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.510> after<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.680> valve<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:22.980> attached

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
put it on after the valve is attached

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.250 
put it on after the valve is attached
and<00:03:23.700> tightened<00:03:24.270> we<00:03:24.510> need<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.720> secure<00:03:25.050> the

we<00:03:45.810> started<00:03:46.200> making<00:03:46.290> each<00:03:46.739> side<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.459> then

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
we started making each side and then

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.400 
we started making each side and then
connected<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.300> sides<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.930> make<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.110> square

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
connected the sides to make a square

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.400 
connected the sides to make a square
just<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.220> do<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.370> right<00:03:50.610> use<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.360> speed<00:03:52.140> square

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
just to do it right use the speed square

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.800 
just to do it right use the speed square
and<00:03:52.680> speed<00:03:53.580> square<00:03:53.820> will<00:03:53.970> line<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.330> up<00:03:54.360> so

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and speed square will line you up so

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.320 
and speed square will line you up so
we're<00:03:55.170> pretty<00:03:55.320> square<00:03:55.800> right<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.180> fit<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
we're pretty square right here fit the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.479 
we're pretty square right here fit the
water<00:03:57.540> jug<00:03:57.870> into<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> box<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.950> attach<00:03:59.250> a

just saw what were you building what

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.199 
just saw what were you building what
does<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.169> do<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.650> water<00:04:20.010> catchment<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.970> catch

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
does it do a water catchment to catch

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.420 
does it do a water catchment to catch
the<00:04:21.450> rainwater<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.260> then<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:23.010> use<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.190> to

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the rainwater and then you can use it to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.550 
the rainwater and then you can use it to
water<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:23.730> lawn<00:04:24.360> let's<00:04:24.900> throw<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.350> homes

because some of us like to conserve

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.510 
because some of us like to conserve
water<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:28.940> have<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.390> mortgage<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.590> bills<00:04:30.620> yes

water and have a mortgage the bills yes
I'm<00:04:31.670> wondering<00:04:32.180> how<00:04:32.330> much<00:04:32.630> water<00:04:33.230> will<00:04:33.680> you

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
I'm wondering how much water will you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.400 
I'm wondering how much water will you
actually<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.460> able<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:34.820> together<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.990> depends

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
actually be able to together it depends

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.810 
actually be able to together it depends
if<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.590> happen<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.890> be<00:04:37.040> over<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.700> like

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
if you happen to be over you like

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.490 
if you happen to be over you like
yesterday<00:04:38.330> man<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.630> had<00:04:38.750> two<00:04:38.960> inches<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.350> a

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
yesterday man we had two inches in a

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.080 
yesterday man we had two inches in a
very<00:04:39.710> short<00:04:39.800> amount<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.310> time<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:40.820> could

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
very short amount of time so that could

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.820 
very short amount of time so that could
be<00:04:41.120> enough<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.480> water<00:04:41.660> one<00:04:41.960> or<00:04:42.080> two<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.710> know

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
be enough to water one or two you know

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.350 
be enough to water one or two you know
plants<00:04:43.130> in<00:04:43.340> your<00:04:43.370> yard<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:44.000> sort<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.300> thing

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
plants in your yard that sort of thing

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120 
plants in your yard that sort of thing
so<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:44.780> kind<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:44.960> depends<00:04:45.290> you<00:04:45.680> do<00:04:45.890> want

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
so it just kind of depends you do want

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.980 
so it just kind of depends you do want
to<00:04:46.310> make<00:04:46.430> sure<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.730> have<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.030> net<00:04:47.330> on<00:04:47.570> top<00:04:47.840> of

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
to make sure you have that net on top of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.390 
to make sure you have that net on top of
it<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.140> it's<00:04:48.350> been<00:04:48.500> on<00:04:48.650> how<00:04:48.770> big<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.070> thing

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
it and it's been on how big the thing

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.740 
it and it's been on how big the thing
they<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.670> several<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.030> those<00:04:50.210> over<00:04:50.630> the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
they have several of those over the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.300 
they have several of those over the
preservation<00:04:51.230> Resource<00:04:51.380> Center<00:04:51.830> are<00:04:52.130> these

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
preservation Resource Center are these

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.730 
preservation Resource Center are these
huge<00:04:52.790> tubs<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.690> they<00:04:54.080> collect<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> water

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
huge tubs that they collect the water

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.590 
huge tubs that they collect the water
and<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.340> they<00:04:55.430> have<00:04:55.580> enough<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:56.060> take<00:04:56.360> care<00:04:56.540> of

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
and and they have enough to take care of

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.540 
and and they have enough to take care of
what<00:04:57.110> they<00:04:57.230> need<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:57.500> water<00:04:57.770> wise<00:04:57.980> they<00:04:58.190> use<00:04:58.340> no

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
what they need to water wise they use no

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.250 
what they need to water wise they use no
water<00:04:58.820> so<00:04:59.150> essentially<00:04:59.570> you're<00:04:59.690> filtering

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
water so essentially you're filtering

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.040 
water so essentially you're filtering
rainwater<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.490> then<00:05:01.640> generally<00:05:02.270> filtering<00:05:02.930> it

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
rainwater to then generally filtering it

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.780 
rainwater to then generally filtering it
the<00:05:03.230> netting<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.040> keep<00:05:04.160> mosquitoes<00:05:04.640> out

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
the netting is to keep mosquitoes out

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.090 
the netting is to keep mosquitoes out
from<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.870> know<00:05:05.900> laid<00:05:06.200> eggs<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.710> all<00:05:06.800> that<00:05:06.980> you

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
from you know laid eggs and all that you

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.740 
from you know laid eggs and all that you
don't<00:05:07.280> want<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.490> do<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.790> you<00:05:08.060> don't<00:05:08.150> have

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
don't want to do that you don't have

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.810 
don't want to do that you don't have
that<00:05:08.900> gated<00:05:09.560> growth<00:05:09.740> but<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.400> will<00:05:10.640> definitely

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
that gated growth but it will definitely

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.040 
that gated growth but it will definitely
keep<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.210> leaves<00:05:11.420> out<00:05:11.600> in<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.780> sort<00:05:12.020> of

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
keep the leaves out in that sort of
