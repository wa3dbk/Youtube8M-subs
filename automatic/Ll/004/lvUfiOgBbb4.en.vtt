00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.760
 very good people I am chaos today I bring you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.309
 a video of metal gear solid peace 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.220
 walker and good this video I upload 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 basically because a lot of people have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.199
 asked how he had got the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.970
 optical camouflage and well here in 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.100
 this video I will show you how 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.730
 got and how can you get it 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.670
 you 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.950
 no less to do is go to operations 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.510
 additional to the additional operation 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.510
 number 50 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 the perfect infiltration 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.590
 say that life is about to see and for 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.590
 twitter was good and 22 weeks left 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.260
 I'm going to show you the equipment that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.810
 user to remove the camouflage from 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 optical here and good we're going to need 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.820
 little thing and the gun silenced 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.250
 and also the stun grenades with 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.870
 these two things we can already get in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.020
 objective complex 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.140
 important grandparents also in a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.690
 infiltration report that we will be 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.930
 quite useful and for me it is the best 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.070
 uniform that there is in this metal gear 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.070
 good we go to the day 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.950
 well to get optical camouflage 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.380
 what we have to do is take out the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.679
 range is the maximum range possible in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 this mission 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.119
 normally in any mission of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.789
 I play with not killing anyone and not 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.000
 jump the alarms you're going to get the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.960
 range of that but in this mission 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 especially 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.130
 apart from not jumping the alarms and not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.619
 will kill anyone we have to do it very 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.390
 but that very fast is worth it if we want 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.490
 get the range s we have to 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.790
 finish the mission in less than three 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.110
 minutes if they take more than three minutes 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.640
 you are going to get the s and as it is logical not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.200
 you're going to get optical camouflage but 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 the truth is very simple here in the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.870
 video 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.400
 I have put you as I get it because 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.170
 so you can see where you have to go 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.770
 more or less and this is the way that I 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.510
 fastest I have found to pass the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.290
 mission in less than three minutes for the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.420
 people 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.020
 so if you follow the path that I follow 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.340
 in this video 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.680
 you are going to get it but but very easy 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.780
 do not bother killing in sleeping 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 all the soldiers because you are going to lose 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.580
 a lot of time and you will not do it in 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.060
 less than three minutes I here leave me 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.250
 many soldiers and without sleep because no 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
 I need it and I can pass without me 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.750
 see 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.239
 that's why I always say follow the path 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.400
 that kept killing the soldiers to sleep 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.129
 that so 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.209
 and you will have less than three 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.209
 minutes you are going to get 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.099
 the truth is quite easy and if it kills you 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.769
 they discover us nothing happens because it is 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.170
 pretty easy to memorize where they are 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.310
 the soldiers are four or five phases 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.620
 what you have to go through and 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.510
 and also that it is not very difficult either 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 it's like I say it's easy to memorize in 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 is the soldiers 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.870
 and well over here we go and we have one 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.870
 phase or two as you see is little thing 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.319
 and with the infiltration uniform as 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.769
 You see we can get close enough to the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.180
 enemies and they do not realize that's why it's 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.680
 It is also essential to carry the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.379
 camouflage the infiltration uniform not 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.360
 it is worth as you see here fast mistakes of 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.480
 shoot and feet some of the back of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.010
 you point and he only surrenders and throws 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.870
 on the ground you do not even need to shoot 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.459
 it's faster to point your back 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.280
 it is already thrown to the ground and we continue 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.670
 forward 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.049
 the last phase 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.900
 let's not get in here on the left 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.470
 crouched and here are going to be two the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.010
 we slept a bad taste of it more 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.930
 fast and as you see pointed from behind 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.340
 pretty fast and now here important 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.680
 we put the blinding grenade 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.430
 and there by the door that will continue 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.430
 two more soldiers 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.260
 we throw the blinding grenades 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.830
 important you have to throw two if you 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.810
 let's say one we did not do well 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.930
 throw two with two centuries left no 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.700
 you see we do not leave them stunned there in the 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.880
 ground and we can pass 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.490
 and seats 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.430
 let's see how long it takes 2 and 7 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.310
 given less than 3 minutes we are going to 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.820
 get that range and camouflage 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.820
 active 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.940
 we'll see 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.500
 to these 245 range that and here they give you 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.409
 the active camouflage to me do not give it to me 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.740
 because I already have it but to you if 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:40.400
 they are worth people and I do not expect anything 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.620
 has helped you and nothing if 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.120
 you have more doubts because you already know is 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.060
 comments or a private message 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.220
 whatever it is to good people I hope that 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.570
 I have served you a greeting and see you in 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.570
 the next video bye bye
