like very relaxed and gameplay compared
to<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> guess<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.270> stuff

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to like I guess a lot of the other stuff

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
to like I guess a lot of the other stuff

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
fixing or figuring out how we're gonna

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.520 
fixing or figuring out how we're gonna
like<00:03:02.000> open<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.690> game<00:03:02.810> up<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.140> player<00:03:03.320> but

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
in general it's gonna be sort of very

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.240 
in general it's gonna be sort of very
self-motivated<00:03:06.260> self<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.069> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
self-motivated self you know the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.470 
self-motivated self you know the
discoveries<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.910> player<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.120> sort<00:03:08.420> of

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
like discover these different different

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.880 
like discover these different different
heads<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.350> explore<00:03:12.350> how<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.620> connect<00:03:12.859> to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
heads and explore how they connect to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.319 
heads and explore how they connect to
each<00:03:13.040> other<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.850> it's<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> very<00:03:14.150> like

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
each other so it's a very like

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.720 
each other so it's a very like
self-directed<00:03:15.260> kind<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.560> game<00:03:15.680> -<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.310> what<00:03:16.579> in

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
self-directed kind of game - and what in

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.379 
self-directed kind of game - and what in
terms<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:18.079> know<00:03:18.109> difficulty<00:03:18.829> or<00:03:19.250> do<00:03:20.239> they

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
terms of you know difficulty or do they

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.759 
terms of you know difficulty or do they
ramp<00:03:20.630> up<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.900> any<00:03:21.019> way<00:03:21.170> or<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.530> more<00:03:21.739> of

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
ramp up in any way or is this more of

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.710 
ramp up in any way or is this more of
just<00:03:21.889> like<00:03:22.100> an<00:03:22.310> explorative<00:03:22.940> type<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.450> it's

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
just like an explorative type of it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.879 
just like an explorative type of it's
different<00:03:23.900> exploration<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.440> mean<00:03:24.530> there's<00:03:24.799> no

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
different exploration I mean there's no

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.349 
different exploration I mean there's no
there's<00:03:25.130> not<00:03:25.190> gonna<00:03:25.549> be<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.700> boss<00:03:25.880> level<00:03:26.120> there

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
there's not gonna be a boss level there

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.550 
there's not gonna be a boss level there
might<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.480> some<00:03:26.720> sort<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.930> Secrets<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.350> find

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
within each of these various heads

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.670 
within each of these various heads
they're<00:03:50.480> all<00:03:50.569> quite<00:03:50.810> different<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.410> really

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
they're all quite different and really

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.500 
they're all quite different and really
creative<00:03:52.130> there's<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.459> lot<00:03:52.639> of<00:03:52.790> detail<00:03:53.480> that

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
creative there's a lot of detail that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.300 
creative there's a lot of detail that
went<00:03:53.840> into<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.290> although<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.680> has<00:03:54.859> a<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.280> know

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
went into it although it has a you know

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.970 
went into it although it has a you know
very<00:03:55.609> simplistic<00:03:56.600> look<00:03:56.840> yeah<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.620> offset

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
very simplistic look yeah on the offset

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.890 
very simplistic look yeah on the offset
you'll<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.670> find<00:03:59.090> little<00:03:59.209> coins<00:03:59.599> that<00:03:59.840> you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
you'll you find little coins that you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.610 
you'll you find little coins that you
can<00:04:00.049> move<00:04:00.230> around<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.830> play<00:04:01.099> with<00:04:01.129> yeah<00:04:02.620> it's

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
can move around and play with yeah it's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.020 
can move around and play with yeah it's
something<00:04:03.860> we<00:04:04.040> were<00:04:04.129> sort<00:04:04.340> of
