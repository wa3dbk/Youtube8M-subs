it's real simple actually

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.400 
it's real simple actually
and<00:00:15.580> beginning<00:00:16.480> stages<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:16.930> skating<00:00:17.260> people

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
and beginning stages of skating people

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.380 
and beginning stages of skating people
can<00:00:17.770> usually<00:00:18.100> have<00:00:18.430> a<00:00:18.460> stamina<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:19.150> will<00:00:19.240> let

can usually have a stamina that will let

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.880 
can usually have a stamina that will let
them<00:00:19.480> go<00:00:19.539> for<00:00:19.750> hours<00:00:20.050> but<00:00:20.230> their<00:00:20.380> feet<00:00:20.590> just

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
them go for hours but their feet just

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.170 
them go for hours but their feet just
can't<00:00:21.070> give<00:00:21.250> them<00:00:21.369> that<00:00:21.520> time<00:00:21.730> because<00:00:22.029> the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
can't give them that time because the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.910 
can't give them that time because the
pain<00:00:22.750> they<00:00:22.900> experience<00:00:23.410> right<00:00:23.620> here<00:00:23.650> in<00:00:23.860> the

across the arch just keep it loose now
you<00:01:12.790> may<00:01:13.030> be<00:01:13.060> thinking<00:01:13.210> well<00:01:13.660> that<00:01:13.690> was<00:01:13.930> simple

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you may be thinking well that was simple

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.530 
you may be thinking well that was simple
I'll<00:01:14.470> just<00:01:14.890> keep<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.640> loose<00:01:15.850> across<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.330> arch

I'll just keep it loose across the arch

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.200 
I'll just keep it loose across the arch
now<00:01:17.260> that's<00:01:17.440> half<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.770> equation<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.850> first

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
now that's half the equation the first

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.420 
now that's half the equation the first
part<00:01:19.480> of<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.600> equation<00:01:20.050> was<00:01:20.260> that<00:01:21.070> we<00:01:21.190> had<00:01:21.400> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
part of the equation was that we had a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.430 
part of the equation was that we had a
completely<00:01:22.150> loose<00:01:22.360> boot<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.870> first<00:01:23.170> place

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
completely loose boot in the first place

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.500 
completely loose boot in the first place
we<00:01:24.040> slipped<00:01:24.370> our<00:01:24.490> foot<00:01:24.730> right<00:01:24.940> into<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.420> we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
we slipped our foot right into it we

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.790 
we slipped our foot right into it we
didn't<00:01:25.690> fight<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.050> because<00:01:26.290> when<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.500> fight

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
didn't fight in because when you fight

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.650 
didn't fight in because when you fight
in<00:01:27.010> right<00:01:27.700> here<00:01:27.880> at<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.030> beginning<00:01:28.150> of<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
in right here at the beginning of the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.950 
in right here at the beginning of the
arch<00:01:28.840> way<00:01:29.110> those<00:01:29.890> laces<00:01:30.190> will<00:01:30.850> push<00:01:31.240> down<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
arch way those laces will push down and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.530 
arch way those laces will push down and
that<00:01:32.800> that<00:01:33.070> push<00:01:33.340> will<00:01:33.580> be<00:01:33.610> will<00:01:34.120> remain<00:01:34.390> in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
that that push will be will remain in

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.720 
that that push will be will remain in
play<00:01:34.780> even<00:01:35.500> after<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.070> tighten<00:01:36.490> these<00:01:36.670> up

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
play even after you tighten these up

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.330 
play even after you tighten these up
just<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.450> little<00:01:37.510> bit<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.680> while<00:01:38.980> you<00:01:39.130> think
