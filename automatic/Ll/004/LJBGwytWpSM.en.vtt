00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
always well recorder is my nemesis and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
always well recorder is my nemesis and
we<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> resort<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> only<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> few

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
we will have to resort to only a few

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.880 
we will have to resort to only a few
newer<00:00:27.150> recordings<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> should

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
newer recordings but I think it should

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.709 
newer recordings but I think it should
be<00:00:28.920> fine<00:00:29.510> let<00:00:30.510> us<00:00:30.630> begin

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
be fine let us begin

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
be fine let us begin
now<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.140> premise<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> sticky<00:00:35.280> ultimate

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
now the premise of the sticky ultimate

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.580 
now the premise of the sticky ultimate
is<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.270> tie<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.870> death<00:00:37.050> mark<00:00:37.350> so

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
is that you tie in your death mark so

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
is that you tie in your death mark so
that<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> will<00:00:38.100> land<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> opponent

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
that you will land on when the opponent

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
that you will land on when the opponent
lands<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:40.079> their<00:00:40.320> escape<00:00:40.680> slash<00:00:41.190> mobility

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
lands from their escape slash mobility

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.569 
lands from their escape slash mobility
spell<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:43.020> example<00:00:43.290> although<00:00:43.739> more

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
spell here is an example although more

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
spell here is an example although more
of<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> miscalculation<00:00:45.149> by<00:00:45.600> Kassadin<00:00:46.140> than<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
of a miscalculation by Kassadin than a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.650 
of a miscalculation by Kassadin than a
calculation<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.160> me<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.850> shows<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.420> timing

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
calculation by me but shows the timing

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.950 
calculation by me but shows the timing
well<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> same<00:00:50.539> there's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
well all the same there's a lot of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
well all the same there's a lot of
anticipation<00:00:52.260> connected<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> usage<00:00:53.579> of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
anticipation connected with the usage of

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
anticipation connected with the usage of
the<00:00:53.879> sticky<00:00:54.149> ultimate<00:00:54.629> bowler<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.440> has<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> do

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the sticky ultimate bowler it has to do

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
the sticky ultimate bowler it has to do
with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> speed<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> enemy's<00:00:57.120> escape

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
with the speed of the enemy's escape

with the speed of the enemy's escape
ability<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> only<00:00:59.309> thing

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
ability this is because the only thing

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.490 
ability this is because the only thing
that<00:00:59.760> matters<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> death<00:01:00.960> mark<00:01:01.320> in

alting it will place you exactly where

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
alting it will place you exactly where
the<00:01:07.799> enemy<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.060> point<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.080> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the enemy is at that point so for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
the enemy is at that point so for

example if you alter Astana as she's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.480 
example if you alter Astana as she's
jumping<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> poorly

jumping and time it poorly

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.830 
jumping and time it poorly
you<00:01:14.760> might<00:01:14.909> finish<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.390> death<00:01:15.540> mark

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you might finish your death mark

from where she lands in this clip I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.200 
from where she lands in this clip I
demonstrate<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.070> very<00:01:23.520> phenomenon

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
demonstrate this very phenomenon

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
demonstrate this very phenomenon
I<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:25.110> approximately<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.979> fast<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
I know approximately how fast the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
I know approximately how fast the
Longinus<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> range<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> and

Longinus and I know the range of it and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
Longinus and I know the range of it and
I<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> old<00:01:29.130> version<00:01:29.520> before<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.909> grabs

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I need to old version before it grabs

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
I need to old version before it grabs
the<00:01:30.180> lantern<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:30.990> close<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.380> him<00:01:31.710> grabbing

the latter and as possible this is why
this<00:01:34.470> signal<00:01:34.979> might<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> bit<00:01:35.880> more

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this signal might be a bit more

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
this signal might be a bit more
difficult<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.659> an<00:01:36.780> experienced<00:01:37.229> players

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
difficult for an experienced players

escape<00:01:43.259> spells<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.829> speed<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.240> believe

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
escape spells of speed but I believe

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359
