00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.720
 I have given me and I have special 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.269
 this place is at level 50 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.180
 event pokemon event 2011 and good what 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.460
 said when it was done but it was done 4 or 5 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.559
 4 times in Japan and 2 in America in 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.829
 europe was not performed would be special or 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.210
 I have pain that has a cintita 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.579
 It is special because it simply 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.970
 they have screaming is a movement of 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.940
 fifth generation with 55 power that 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.879
 lowers the special afternoon by doing so at 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.500
 use it and nothing is the only thing and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.149
 good for tenacious euro well able to do 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.460
 an egg I believe with a data or something not 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.180
 I guess I do but I 'm not very 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.860
 safe 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.020
 the rare nature this special deal 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 that has the speed jaume and even so 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.100
 also the physical tate defenses are very 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.700
 bad so I do not like this pokemon 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.370
 that has many behind having a lot 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.490
 traffic and if you normally only use one 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.860
 just a special physical sax not both 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.400
 that's why I would prefer for example to distribute 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.020
 the eps jeeps that attend in attack 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.820
 and dealings in both defense and 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.920
 in special defense or even more up 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.930
 the special and speed but not that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.580
 have the defenses and all those and that 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 is totally wasted that is the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.570
 why I do not like pokemon but 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.080
 is not very very cool and also the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.260
 Bible 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.300
 the skill 3 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.720
 the least tempting assured good guys 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.310
 if you want him 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.020
 the pokemon this you already know to fail anything 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.690
 he asks you if you tell him what 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.800
 dollar element with yell and puts it 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.080
 in a little while 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.460
 the most you can put is I think that 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.350
 are two or three events because some 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.350
 they have many pokemon for example 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.950
 if you want to see all the events you will have 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.930
 an annotation in the video and in the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.340
 description also you have it so 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.870
 good if you like the favorite ones 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.160
 it's a very short video and it will be 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.160
 goodbye staff
