00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200 
obliged to show how clever they're being
as<00:00:09.690> historians<00:00:10.349> by<00:00:11.010> as<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.610> were<00:00:11.700> taking<00:00:12.150> a

as historians by as it were taking a
razor<00:00:12.389> blade<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.780> saying<00:00:13.230> oh<00:00:13.500> now<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:13.889> can<00:00:14.309> see

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
razor blade and saying oh now we can see

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.890 
razor blade and saying oh now we can see
that<00:00:14.700> there's<00:00:14.880> something<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that there's something going on here and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.060 
that there's something going on here and
there's<00:00:16.020> something<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
there's something going on there and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.599 
there's something going on there and
often<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.850> happens<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.230> people<00:00:19.650> like

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
often what happens is that people like

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
often what happens is that people like
to<00:00:20.670> pull<00:00:21.119> together<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.840> different<00:00:22.320> stories

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to pull together two different stories

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.050 
to pull together two different stories
and<00:00:22.740> say<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.910> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
and say really this was just one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
and say really this was just one
incident<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.840> told<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.230> different

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
incident but it's told in two different

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.779 
incident but it's told in two different
ways<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> feeding<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> five

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
ways like the feeding of the five

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.310 
ways like the feeding of the five
thousand<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> eating<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> four<00:00:27.869> thousand

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
thousand of eating of the four thousand

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
thousand of eating of the four thousand
they<00:00:28.410> say<00:00:28.560> maybe<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.369> only<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.820> thing

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
they say maybe there was only one thing

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
they say maybe there was only one thing
and<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.779> has<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.199> differently<00:00:31.710> will

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and it has come out differently will

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.010 
and it has come out differently will
you'd<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.460> thought<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.300> mark

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you'd have thought that you know mark

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
you'd have thought that you know mark
might<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.380> noticed<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.250> mean<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.640> he

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
might have noticed that I mean was he

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
might have noticed that I mean was he
just<00:00:35.940> being<00:00:36.120> stupid<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:36.899> two<00:00:37.230> different

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
just being stupid to say two different

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.819 
just being stupid to say two different
ways<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.879> answer<00:00:39.120> might<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.360> yes<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:40.140> maybe

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
ways the answer might be yes but maybe

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
ways the answer might be yes but maybe
we're<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.340> being<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.670> clever<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.540> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
we're just being too clever and then you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.880 
we're just being too clever and then you
get<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> same<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.350> happening<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
get the same thing happening when you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
get the same thing happening when you
get<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.550> account<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> story<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
get one account like the story of the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
get one account like the story of the
resurrection<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:47.070> scholars<00:00:47.550> saying

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
resurrection and then scholars saying

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
resurrection and then scholars saying
well<00:00:48.000> really<00:00:48.300> these<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.480> quite<00:00:48.750> independent

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
well really these are quite independent

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.660 
well really these are quite independent
traditions<00:00:49.890> there's<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.219> appearance

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
traditions there's an appearance

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
traditions there's an appearance
tradition<00:00:51.149> there's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> women<00:00:51.750> tradition

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tradition there's a women tradition

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
tradition there's a women tradition
there's<00:00:52.350> an<00:00:52.469> empty<00:00:53.039> tomb<00:00:53.250> tradition<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.789> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
there's an empty tomb tradition as a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
there's an empty tomb tradition as a
pita<00:00:54.090> tradition<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.350> quite

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
pita tradition and these are all quite

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
pita tradition and these are all quite
separate<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.820> come

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
separate and we can see that they come

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
separate and we can see that they come
from<00:00:57.059> different<00:00:57.300> parts<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> early<00:00:58.170> church

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
from different parts in the early church

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
from different parts in the early church
and<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> evangelists<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.850> cleverly

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and that the evangelists have cleverly

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
and that the evangelists have cleverly
pulled<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.719> together<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.399> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
pulled it together so it's really as we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.070 
pulled it together so it's really as we
say<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> England<00:01:03.149> heads<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.510> win<00:01:03.690> tails<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
say in England heads I win tails you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
say in England heads I win tails you
lose<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.559> toss<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> coin<00:01:05.360> we<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
lose you know toss the coin we are so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
lose you know toss the coin we are so
clever<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:07.530> two<00:01:07.680> incidents

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
clever that if there's two incidents

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.230 
clever that if there's two incidents
we'll<00:01:08.280> say<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.580> were<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.090> there's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
we'll say there were one and if there's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.460 
we'll say there were one and if there's
one<00:01:09.270> incident<00:01:09.780> we'll<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.110> half<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
one incident we'll say it was half a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
one incident we'll say it was half a
dozen<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.420> proves

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
dozen and I don't think that proves

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
dozen and I don't think that proves
anything<00:01:13.320> more<00:01:13.590> than<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.939> ancient

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
anything more than as with all ancient

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.719 
anything more than as with all ancient
history<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.280> enough<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
history we really don't know enough to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
history we really don't know enough to
be<00:01:18.150> able<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> nail<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.170> thing<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.650> one

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
be able to nail this thing down one

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
be able to nail this thing down one
thing<00:01:20.310> after<00:01:20.490> another<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.150> after<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.659> even

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
thing after another and after all even

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.700 
thing after another and after all even
in<00:01:21.990> modern<00:01:22.320> history

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in modern history

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
in modern history
nobody's<00:01:23.400> still<00:01:23.610> quite<00:01:24.030> knows<00:01:24.299> who<00:01:24.570> killed

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
nobody's still quite knows who killed

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
nobody's still quite knows who killed
JFK<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.710> mean<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.070> there's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> debate

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
JFK I mean you know there's a debate

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
JFK I mean you know there's a debate
about<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:28.140> lots<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> things<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
about it and there's lots of things that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710 
about it and there's lots of things that
happen<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> our<00:01:29.340> own<00:01:29.400> day<00:01:29.820> massively
