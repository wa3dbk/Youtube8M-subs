00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
collection point to be then we're going

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220

to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.489> placing<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.090> hopper<00:01:00.539> facing<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to be placing a hopper facing into the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
to be placing a hopper facing into the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
back of the chest then we need to make a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.310 
back of the chest then we need to make a
3<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:04.739> 5<00:01:05.129> platform<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.810> back<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
hopper or including that hopper I guess

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
hopper or including that hopper I guess
I<00:01:09.780> should<00:01:10.020> say<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.950> something<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.760> then

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
I should say so something like that then

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
I should say so something like that then
we're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> put<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.140> solid<00:01:13.530> blocks

could<00:04:57.430> have<00:04:57.460> made<00:04:57.639> this<00:04:57.759> a<00:04:57.819> little<00:04:58.029> bit<00:04:58.210> more

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
could have made this a little bit more

efficient but we added them both in to

efficient but we added them both in to

health<00:05:14.680> you<00:05:15.159> can<00:05:15.340> simply<00:05:15.699> adjust<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:16.270> timings

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750

on<00:05:16.990> these<00:05:17.229> three<00:05:17.710> repeaters<00:05:18.310> here<00:05:18.339> to<00:05:19.240> fix

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
on these three repeaters here to fix

this<00:05:20.319> design<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:20.919> this<00:05:21.159> is<00:05:21.370> future<00:05:21.849> proof<00:05:21.879> as

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
this design so this is future proof as

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.329 
this design so this is future proof as
well<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.599> should<00:05:22.629> never<00:05:22.990> ever<00:05:23.169> break<00:05:23.469> well<00:05:24.069> in

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:24.339 
well it should never ever break well in

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:25.890 
well it should never ever break well in
my<00:05:24.610> break<00:05:24.849> but<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.240> should<00:05:25.389> be<00:05:25.479> super<00:05:25.749> super

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
my break but it should be super super

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.869 
my break but it should be super super
easy<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.439> fix<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:27.069> what<00:05:27.249> I'm<00:05:27.339> getting<00:05:27.580> at

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
easy to fix is what I'm getting at

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.809 
easy to fix is what I'm getting at
so<00:05:28.169> maybe<00:05:29.169> drop<00:05:29.499> another<00:05:29.770> like<00:05:30.069> double<00:05:30.639> like

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
so maybe drop another like double like

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.029 
so maybe drop another like double like
the<00:05:31.029> video<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.449> know<00:05:31.810> sign<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.740> with<00:05:32.889> that

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
the video you know sign in with that
