digestive system can you imagine the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.620 
digestive system can you imagine the
benefits<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.199> doing<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:29.090> not<00:00:30.090> only<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
benefits of doing that not only do you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
benefits of doing that not only do you
get<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> goodness<00:00:31.529> from<00:00:31.560> each<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.130> the

get the goodness from each of the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.850 
get the goodness from each of the
constituents<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> highly<00:00:33.570> concentrated

constituents in a highly concentrated
form<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.700> ingredients<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.600> also

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
form the ingredients are also

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.770 
form the ingredients are also
transformed<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:37.950> highly<00:00:38.489> bioavailable

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
transformed into highly bioavailable

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.389 
transformed into highly bioavailable
liquid<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.110> perfect<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.770> absorption

liquid that is perfect for absorption
into<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.090> body<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> mean<00:00:44.370> to
