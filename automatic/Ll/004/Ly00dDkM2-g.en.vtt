unlike<00:03:01.020> past<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.620> terrier<00:03:01.950> game<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
unlike past a terrier game the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
unlike past a terrier game the
characters<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.910> seem<00:03:03.150> more<00:03:03.180> mature<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.110> for

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
characters just seem more mature so for

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.680 
characters just seem more mature so for
the<00:03:04.500> graphics<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.130> this<00:03:05.280> game<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.850> really<00:03:06.420> think

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the graphics in this game I really think

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.930 
the graphics in this game I really think
they<00:03:06.870> were<00:03:06.930> pretty<00:03:07.320> good<00:03:07.590> compared<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.460> some

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
they were pretty good compared to some

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.150 
they were pretty good compared to some
of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.090> other<00:03:09.360> games<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.140> about<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.920> same

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
of the other games it's about the same

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.250 
of the other games it's about the same
in<00:03:11.490> graphics<00:03:12.150> was<00:03:12.330> but<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.050> main

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
in graphics was but for the main

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.900 
in graphics was but for the main
characters<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:14.040> seems<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.430> there's<00:03:14.610> more

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
characters it seems like there's more

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.540 
characters it seems like there's more
detail<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.020> characters<00:03:16.470> than<00:03:16.920> before<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
detail on the characters than before and

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.460 
detail on the characters than before and
when<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> change<00:03:18.480> when<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.110> change<00:03:19.140> your

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
when you change when you change your

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410 
when you change when you change your
clothes<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.070> see<00:03:20.310> them<00:03:20.670> change<00:03:21.060> like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
clothes you can see them change like

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.760 
clothes you can see them change like
like<00:03:21.660> every<00:03:21.900> time<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.200> change<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.470> outfit

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
like every time you change the outfit

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.230 
like every time you change the outfit
something<00:03:23.130> new<00:03:23.430> will<00:03:23.610> be<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.850> your<00:03:24.030> character

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
something new will be on your character

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.700 
something new will be on your character
how<00:03:24.390> come<00:03:24.600> he<00:03:24.690> says<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:25.020> thought<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.500> pretty

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
how come he says I thought it was pretty

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.949 
how come he says I thought it was pretty
easy<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.250> time<00:03:26.490> compared<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:26.970> past<00:03:27.209> games<00:03:27.630> I

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
easy this time compared to past games I

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.170 
easy this time compared to past games I
think<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:29.010> harder<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.760> get<00:03:29.910> used

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
think it was a little harder to get used

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.210 
think it was a little harder to get used
to<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.630> you're<00:03:30.840> new<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.050> this<00:03:31.320> series<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.010> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
to if you're new to this series but I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.670 
to if you're new to this series but I
really<00:03:32.640> feel<00:03:32.910> like<00:03:32.940> they<00:03:33.420> made<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.720> easier<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
really feel like they made it easier and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.370 
really feel like they made it easier and
more<00:03:34.770> condensed<00:03:35.610> than<00:03:36.150> before<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.870> for<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
more condensed than before and for the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.920 
more condensed than before and for the
gameplay<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.640> first<00:03:38.910> time<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.630> have

ever<00:03:40.110> seen<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.950> these<00:03:41.100> series<00:03:41.550> of

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
ever seen in one of these series of

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.600 
ever seen in one of these series of

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
upgrades they've had because you'd have

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.840

with<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.780> timing<00:04:35.530> system<00:04:36.040> basically<00:04:36.550> you'll

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
with the timing system basically you'll

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.580

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
defense and everything but it did that a

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.029 
defense and everything but it did that a
few<00:05:52.870> times<00:05:52.900> when<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.440> was<00:05:53.560> playing<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.860> game

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
background and such but the main

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
replayability and also the characters

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.140 
replayability and also the characters
are<00:07:10.200> so<00:07:10.380> likeable<00:07:10.919> I<00:07:11.100> really<00:07:11.490> enjoy<00:07:11.790> him<00:07:11.970> a<00:07:12.000> lot

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
I really didn't see any downfalls in

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.950 
I really didn't see any downfalls in
this<00:07:14.490> game<00:07:14.730> other<00:07:15.060> than<00:07:15.390> maybe<00:07:15.750> the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
this game other than maybe the

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.659 
this game other than maybe the
background<00:07:16.140> graphics<00:07:16.800> but<00:07:16.950> it's<00:07:17.190> more<00:07:17.490> of<00:07:17.550> a

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669 
background graphics but it's more of a

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.700 
background graphics but it's more of a
Borderlands<00:07:18.300> type<00:07:18.510> of<00:07:18.660> art<00:07:18.840> style<00:07:19.169> overall<00:07:19.680> I

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710

five<00:07:24.780> out<00:07:25.050> of<00:07:25.080> ten<00:07:25.410> just<00:07:25.710> for<00:07:25.830> the<00:07:25.950> fact<00:07:26.220> that

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
five out of ten just for the fact that

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.250 
five out of ten just for the fact that
it<00:07:26.610> feels<00:07:26.669> like<00:07:27.180> the<00:07:27.360> graphics<00:07:27.870> could<00:07:28.110> be<00:07:28.229> a

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.260 
it feels like the graphics could be a

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260 
it feels like the graphics could be a
little<00:07:28.470> better<00:07:28.710> in<00:07:29.010> the<00:07:29.070> background<00:07:29.610> and<00:07:29.910> one
