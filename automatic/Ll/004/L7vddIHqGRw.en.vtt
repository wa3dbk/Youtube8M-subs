00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the issues bacterially that your lake

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.539 
the issues bacterially that your lake
and<00:02:20.269> ponds<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.750> pools<00:02:20.989> do<00:02:21.410> that's<00:02:22.129> important

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
and ponds and pools do that's important

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.800 
and ponds and pools do that's important
to<00:02:22.610> tell<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.790> position<00:02:23.269> where<00:02:23.510> you've<00:02:23.690> been

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
to tell the position where you've been

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.449 
to tell the position where you've been
swimming<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.440> because<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:25.010> affect<00:02:25.310> your

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
swimming to because that can affect your

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.470 
swimming to because that can affect your
treatment<00:02:25.910> somewhat<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:27.489> what<00:02:28.489> happens<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.120> is

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
treatment somewhat so what happens is is

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.600 
treatment somewhat so what happens is is
as<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.349> area<00:02:30.709> near<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.220> showed<00:02:31.489> you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
as the area near that I showed you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.949 
as the area near that I showed you
before<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.030> gets<00:02:32.180> inflamed

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
before it gets inflamed

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.300 
before it gets inflamed
if<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.799> move<00:02:34.099> your<00:02:34.519> ear<00:02:34.849> here<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.380> hurts<00:02:36.860> to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
if you move your ear here it hurts to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.910 
if you move your ear here it hurts to
move<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.730> year<00:02:38.110> where<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.200> hurts<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.709> most

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
move the year where it hurts the most

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.400 
move the year where it hurts the most
isn't<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.790> moving<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.269> year<00:02:41.450> here<00:02:41.870> but

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
isn't just moving the year here but

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.789 
isn't just moving the year here but
pressing<00:02:42.910> right<00:02:43.910> here<00:02:44.599> like<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.470> port

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
pressing right here like this port

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.400 
pressing right here like this port
probably<00:02:46.220> tragus<00:02:46.640> is<00:02:46.819> when<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> press<00:02:48.079> down

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
probably tragus is when you press down

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.250 
probably tragus is when you press down
it's<00:02:49.099> like<00:02:49.370> closing<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:50.000> garbage<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.690> lid<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
it's like closing a garbage can lid and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.839 
it's like closing a garbage can lid and
that<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.709> really<00:02:51.950> hurt<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.519> that's<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
that can really hurt and that's the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.819 
that can really hurt and that's the
first<00:02:53.180> thing<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.540> really<00:02:53.959> hurts<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
first thing that really hurts and the

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.920 
first thing that really hurts and the
swimmers<00:02:55.220> here<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:55.970> kids<00:02:56.239> sometimes<00:02:56.630> can't

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
swimmers here now kids sometimes can't

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.500 
swimmers here now kids sometimes can't
sleep<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.530> ear<00:02:58.130> whereas<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> middle<00:02:59.329> ear

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
sleep on that ear whereas a middle ear

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.289 
sleep on that ear whereas a middle ear
infection<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.200> showed<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.769> room<00:03:01.299> it's

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
infection so I showed you this room it's

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.119 
infection so I showed you this room it's
not<00:03:02.569> going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.840> bother<00:03:02.959> them<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.560> sleep<00:03:03.799> on<00:03:04.010> an

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
not going to bother them to sleep on an

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.770 
not going to bother them to sleep on an
air<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.519> not<00:03:04.760> going<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.000> bother<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.420> them<00:03:05.569> to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
air it's not going to bother to them to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.289 
air it's not going to bother to them to
move<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.200> ear<00:03:06.530> as<00:03:06.829> well<00:03:07.160> because<00:03:08.090> those

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
move the ear as well because those

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.330 
move the ear as well because those
because<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.350> portion<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.130> not

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
because that portion is not

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.039 
because that portion is not
communicating<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.209> skin<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.750> outer

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
communicating with the skin on the outer

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.830 
communicating with the skin on the outer
ear<00:03:12.530> therefore<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.459> not<00:03:13.670> going<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.299> hurt

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
ear therefore it's not going to hurt

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.680 
ear therefore it's not going to hurt
when<00:03:15.109> you<00:03:15.200> move<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.590> ear<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.730> what<00:03:16.940> happens<00:03:17.420> is

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
when you move the ear so what happens is

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.460 
when you move the ear so what happens is
is<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.519> first<00:03:19.519> sign<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.690> that

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
is that the first sign of this is that

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.910 
is that the first sign of this is that
when<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.010> move<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.370> ear<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.760> hurts<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:24.680> what

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
when you move the ear it hurts then what

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.890 
when you move the ear it hurts then what
will<00:03:25.069> start<00:03:25.280> happening<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.299> becomes<00:03:26.630> a

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
will start happening if it becomes a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.970 
will start happening if it becomes a
deeper<00:03:27.380> infection<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:29.720> it'll<00:03:30.560> spread

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
deeper infection is that it'll spread

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.339 
deeper infection is that it'll spread
into<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.790> area<00:03:32.299> here<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.840> area<00:03:33.200> where

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
into this area here the area where

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.259 
into this area here the area where
there's<00:03:33.560> some<00:03:33.920> internal<00:03:34.519> cartilage<00:03:35.060> and

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
there's some internal cartilage and

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.300 
there's some internal cartilage and
those<00:03:35.989> kids<00:03:36.319> have<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> moderate<00:03:37.220> moderate

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
those kids have a moderate moderate

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.280 
those kids have a moderate moderate
swimmers<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:41.180> may<00:03:41.359> start<00:03:41.690> not

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
swimmers here and they may start not

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.470 
swimmers here and they may start not
wanting<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.829> open<00:03:43.099> their<00:03:43.250> mouth<00:03:43.459> much<00:03:43.819> because

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
wanting to open their mouth much because

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.920 
wanting to open their mouth much because
it<00:03:44.630> hurts<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.109> open<00:03:45.440> their<00:03:45.620> mouth<00:03:46.690> too<00:03:47.690> much

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
it hurts to open their mouth too much

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.259 
it hurts to open their mouth too much
because<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.799> cartilage<00:03:49.340> here<00:03:49.609> is<00:03:49.790> inflamed

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
because the cartilage here is inflamed

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.780 
because the cartilage here is inflamed
and<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:51.139> leaning<00:03:51.560> against<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.250> jawbone

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
and it's leaning against the jawbone

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.050 
and it's leaning against the jawbone
right<00:03:53.480> here<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:54.980> when<00:03:55.190> things<00:03:55.430> get<00:03:55.790> worse

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
right here so then when things get worse

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.080 
right here so then when things get worse
and<00:03:56.450> worse<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.109> worse<00:03:57.250> people<00:03:58.250> will<00:03:58.579> not<00:03:58.760> even

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
and worse and worse people will not even

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.819 
and worse and worse people will not even
open<00:03:59.540> their<00:03:59.750> mouth<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.290> there'll<00:04:00.799> be

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
open their mouth and there'll be

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.909 
open their mouth and there'll be
swelling<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.819> ear<00:04:02.060> that's<00:04:02.959> very<00:04:03.470> rarely

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
swelling in the ear that's very rarely

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.569 
swelling in the ear that's very rarely
