good side knob but as you can see the
center<00:01:00.050> knob<00:01:00.230> there's<00:01:00.500> nothing<00:01:00.890> there<00:01:01.070> it's

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
center knob there's nothing there it's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.100 
center knob there's nothing there it's
just<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.760> little<00:01:01.970> bit<00:01:02.060> of<00:01:02.150> traction<00:01:02.390> if<00:01:02.960> you

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
just a little bit of traction if you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.420 
just a little bit of traction if you
live<00:01:03.290> in<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.440> place<00:01:03.620> or<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.950> desert<00:01:04.189> climate

you<00:01:07.220> might<00:01:07.400> decide<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.759> I<00:01:08.210> like<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> way

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
you might decide that I like the way

you might decide that I like the way
this<00:01:08.960> thing<00:01:09.140> runs<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.530> partly<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.950> road<00:01:10.220> tire

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
this thing runs is partly a road tire

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.399 
this thing runs is partly a road tire
got<00:01:11.000> some<00:01:11.150> nice<00:01:11.330> volume<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:12.140> comes<00:01:12.320> in

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
got some nice volume because it comes in

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.460 
got some nice volume because it comes in
a<00:01:12.500> 2.1<00:01:12.950> size<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:13.970> really<00:01:14.540> this<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:14.720> not<00:01:15.020> an<00:01:15.229> all

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
a 2.1 size but really this is not an all

around<00:01:15.830> mountain<00:01:16.159> bike<00:01:16.280> tire<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:16.640> not<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.789> mud

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
around mountain bike tire it's not a mud

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.270 
around mountain bike tire it's not a mud
tire<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:17.749> very<00:01:18.049> very<00:01:18.320> dry<00:01:18.710> condition

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
tire it's a very very dry condition

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.669 
tire it's a very very dry condition
summer<00:01:19.609> tire<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.539> you<00:01:21.079> would<00:01:21.170> only<00:01:21.289> use<00:01:21.409> this

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
summer tire so you would only use this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.859 
summer tire so you would only use this
in<00:01:21.859> extreme<00:01:22.280> circumstances<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:23.539> you're<00:01:23.810> a

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
in extreme circumstances or if you're a

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.260 
in extreme circumstances or if you're a
region<00:01:24.259> particularly<00:01:24.909> dictated<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.090> is

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
region particularly dictated this is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.709 
region particularly dictated this is
your<00:01:26.450> Kuyper<00:01:26.689> tire<00:01:29.439> now<00:01:30.729> moving<00:01:31.729> up<00:01:31.999> at<00:01:32.240> one

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
your Kuyper tire now moving up at one

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.069 
your Kuyper tire now moving up at one
level<00:01:33.170> we<00:01:33.770> have<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.219> cross<00:01:34.999> mark<00:01:35.329> this<00:01:35.749> is<00:01:35.929> what

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
level we have a cross mark this is what

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.169 
level we have a cross mark this is what
I<00:01:36.109> consider<00:01:36.499> to<00:01:36.530> be<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.710> great<00:01:37.189> all-around<00:01:37.490> tire

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
I consider to be a great all-around tire

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.349 
I consider to be a great all-around tire
again<00:01:38.689> we<00:01:39.409> have<00:01:39.530> great<00:01:39.920> edge<00:01:40.159> knob<00:01:40.579> for<00:01:40.880> corner

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
again we have great edge knob for corner

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.690 
again we have great edge knob for corner
and<00:01:41.539> control<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.409> center<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:42.979> well<00:01:43.280> spaced

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
and control the center is well spaced

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.879 
and control the center is well spaced
out<00:01:43.939> so<00:01:44.210> you've<00:01:44.329> got<00:01:44.509> good<00:01:44.749> mud<00:01:45.020> clearance<00:01:45.439> the

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
out so you've got good mud clearance the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.830 
out so you've got good mud clearance the
knobs<00:01:46.159> are<00:01:46.399> angled<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:46.999> shaped<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.659> you're

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
knobs are angled and shaped so you're

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.599 
knobs are angled and shaped so you're
you've<00:01:48.109> got<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> forward<00:01:48.679> direction<00:01:49.130> for<00:01:49.369> fast

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
you've got a forward direction for fast

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.239 
you've got a forward direction for fast
rolling<00:01:50.240> yet<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.289> back<00:01:51.530> side<00:01:51.859> gives<00:01:52.100> you

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
rolling yet the back side gives you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.099 
rolling yet the back side gives you
paddling<00:01:52.819> for<00:01:53.030> braking<00:01:53.479> which<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.749> very<00:01:53.929> very

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
paddling for braking which is very very

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.599 
paddling for braking which is very very
important<00:01:54.530> there's<00:01:54.889> a<00:01:55.009> little<00:01:55.249> bit<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.429> knob

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
important there's a little bit of knob

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.879 
important there's a little bit of knob
profile<00:01:56.149> here<00:01:56.420> some<00:01:57.200> people<00:01:57.409> might<00:01:57.560> say<00:01:57.740> well

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
profile here some people might say well

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.279 
profile here some people might say well
that's<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.159> pretty<00:01:58.280> low<00:01:58.639> profile<00:01:59.090> tire<00:01:59.389> and<00:02:00.170> it

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
that's a pretty low profile tire and it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.109 
that's a pretty low profile tire and it
is<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.439> low<00:02:00.649> profile<00:02:01.009> tire<00:02:01.219> but<00:02:01.549> it's<00:02:01.700> actually

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
of the best all-around tires now we're

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.119 
of the best all-around tires now we're
getting<00:02:20.420> into<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.659> specific<00:02:21.019> type<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.099> a

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
getting into a specific type this is a

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.590 
getting into a specific type this is a
mud<00:02:22.489> tire<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.180> called<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.450> Medusa<00:02:23.959> usually

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
mud tire it's called the Medusa usually

mud tires you run smaller and narrower

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
mud tires you run smaller and narrower
see<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> profiles<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.710> quite<00:02:29.040> high<00:02:29.340> quite

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
see the profiles are quite high quite

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
see the profiles are quite high quite
tall<00:02:30.090> knobs<00:02:30.450> that's<00:02:30.960> gonna<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.530> through

the<00:02:32.100> mud<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:33.000> contact<00:02:33.570> with<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> bedrock

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
the mud and to contact with the bedrock

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.740 
the mud and to contact with the bedrock
very<00:02:35.070> well<00:02:35.310> spaced<00:02:35.670> out<00:02:35.850> for<00:02:36.090> clearance<00:02:36.450> again

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
very well spaced out for clearance again

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the Larsson TT this is a perfect example

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.030 
the Larsson TT this is a perfect example
of<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.000> combination<00:02:54.570> between<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.410> cross<00:02:55.680> mark

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
of a combination between the cross mark

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.340 
of a combination between the cross mark
and<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.400> Medusa<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.630> got<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> few<00:02:58.230> more

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and the Medusa it's got a few more

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.290 
and the Medusa it's got a few more
blocks<00:02:58.560> they're<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> little<00:02:59.340> taller<00:02:59.700> profile

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
blocks they're a little taller profile

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.270 
blocks they're a little taller profile
than<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.480> cross<00:03:00.750> mark<00:03:01.020> and<00:03:01.320> they're<00:03:02.130> not

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
than the cross mark and they're not

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
than the cross mark and they're not
specific<00:03:02.790> mud<00:03:03.030> tire<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.720> you're<00:03:03.840> getting

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
specific mud tire so as you're getting

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.410 
specific mud tire so as you're getting
into<00:03:04.170> more<00:03:04.440> lomi<00:03:04.890> muddy<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.400> conditions<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
into more lomi muddy or conditions you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.830 
into more lomi muddy or conditions you
would<00:03:06.770> transition<00:03:07.770> from<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.730> cross<00:03:09.000> mark<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
would transition from the cross mark to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.870 
would transition from the cross mark to
the<00:03:10.080> larsson<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:10.980> then<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.550> got<00:03:11.700> into

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
the larsson and then if you got into

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.370 
the larsson and then if you got into
some<00:03:12.030> deep<00:03:12.240> mud<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> would<00:03:12.930> go<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
some deep mud then you would go to the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.710 
some deep mud then you would go to the
Medusa<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.310> these<00:03:14.430> are<00:03:14.610> all<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:15.360> consider

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
Medusa so these are all what we consider

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.430 
Medusa so these are all what we consider
to<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:16.190> XC<00:03:17.190> style<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.970> XC<00:03:18.480> sighs<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:19.320> that's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to be XC style and XC sighs now that's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
to be XC style and XC sighs now that's
cross<00:03:19.830> country<00:03:20.130> cross<00:03:20.610> country<00:03:20.820> sizing<00:03:21.330> is

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
cross country cross country sizing is

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.490 
cross country cross country sizing is
usually<00:03:21.920> 1.9<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.520> 2.1<00:03:24.270> depending<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.080> your

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
usually 1.9 to 2.1 depending on your

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.870 
usually 1.9 to 2.1 depending on your
body<00:03:25.710> weight<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.340> terrain<00:03:26.640> you're

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
body weight and the terrain you're

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.730 
body weight and the terrain you're
riding<00:03:27.150> everything<00:03:27.870> has<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.170> be<00:03:28.230> matched<00:03:28.440> up

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
riding everything has to be matched up

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740 
riding everything has to be matched up
so<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.220> takes<00:03:29.460> a<00:03:29.550> lot<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.880> consideration<00:03:30.600> as

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
so it takes a lot of consideration as

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.710 
so it takes a lot of consideration as
you<00:03:31.500> move<00:03:31.920> up<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.190> size<00:03:32.550> as<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> person<00:03:33.570> if

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you move up in size as a person if

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.810 
you move up in size as a person if
you're<00:03:33.810> pushing<00:03:34.170> 180<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.740> 200<00:03:35.130> pounds<00:03:35.310> or

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
you're pushing 180 to 200 pounds or

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.030 
you're pushing 180 to 200 pounds or
you're<00:03:36.120> doing<00:03:36.240> more<00:03:36.540> more<00:03:36.990> descending<00:03:37.620> that's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
you're doing more more descending that's

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.060 
you're doing more more descending that's
when<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.310> want<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.580> consider<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.290> 2.25<00:03:40.290> tire<00:03:40.830> or

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
when you want to consider a 2.25 tire or

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.260 
when you want to consider a 2.25 tire or
a<00:03:41.280> 2.35<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:43.080> all<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> 2.35<00:03:44.310> tires<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:45.030> start

because it says it's called d-h we run
this<00:04:00.990> quite<00:04:01.200> often<00:04:01.410> on<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> cross-country

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
this quite often on a cross-country

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.810 
bikes around Vancouver it's a quite a
light<00:04:04.590> tire<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.100> as<00:04:05.280> light<00:04:05.430> as<00:04:05.520> anything

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820

cross-countries<00:04:06.390> we've<00:04:06.510> looked<00:04:06.750> at<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.290> has<00:04:07.440> a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
cross-countries we've looked at it has a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.560 
cross-countries we've looked at it has a
bit<00:04:07.710> more<00:04:07.860> volume<00:04:08.130> being<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.460> 2.35

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
bit more volume being a 2.35

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.360 
bit more volume being a 2.35
so<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.900> gives<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.140> bit<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> cushion<00:04:10.800> but

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
so it gives you a bit of cushion but

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.770 
so it gives you a bit of cushion but
that<00:04:11.610> also<00:04:11.760> adds<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.150> your<00:04:12.270> traction<00:04:12.720> because

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that also adds to your traction because

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.120 
that also adds to your traction because
you<00:04:12.960> can<00:04:13.110> run<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> little<00:04:13.410> bit<00:04:13.560> lower<00:04:13.740> pressure

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
you can run a little bit lower pressure

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.520 
you can run a little bit lower pressure
which<00:04:14.730> allows<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.480> tires<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.900> conform<00:04:16.410> around

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
which allows the tires to conform around

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.990 
which allows the tires to conform around
the<00:04:16.799> roots<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.400> give<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.640> some<00:04:17.790> traction

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the roots and give you some traction

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.940 
the roots and give you some traction
many<00:04:18.630> people<00:04:18.900> ask<00:04:19.049> what<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.440> good<00:04:19.500> time<00:04:19.830> for

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
downhill tire they come in two ply so

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.580 
downhill tire they come in two ply so
they<00:04:54.860> don't<00:04:55.070> come<00:04:55.280> in<00:04:55.430> folding<00:04:55.850> they're<00:04:56.660> two
