00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
same way we do they purse their lips if

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.840 
same way we do they purse their lips if
you<00:01:59.470> want<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.800> call<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.100> edges<00:02:00.400> of<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.640> jaws

you want to call the edges of the jaws

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.660 
you want to call the edges of the jaws
lips<00:02:01.350> then<00:02:02.350> create<00:02:02.710> suction<00:02:02.950> by<00:02:03.220> flexing

that's one of the cool things about the
narcissus<00:02:24.750> Nick<00:02:24.959> Thames<00:02:25.230> there's<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.800> many

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
narcissus Nick Thames there's so many

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
narcissus Nick Thames there's so many
snakes<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.060> busy<00:02:27.240> doing<00:02:27.600> what

snakes and they are so busy doing what

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.260 
snakes and they are so busy doing what
snakes<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:29.490> often<00:02:29.640> oblivious

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
snakes do but they are often oblivious

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.059

that<00:02:30.300> people<00:02:30.780> staring<00:02:31.080> at<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.890> can

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
that people staring at them and you can

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.890 
that people staring at them and you can
witness<00:02:32.370> aspects<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> biology<00:02:33.300> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
witness aspects of the biology that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:43.400 
witness aspects of the biology that
should<00:02:34.080> never<00:02:34.200> otherwise<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> see<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:43.380> I
