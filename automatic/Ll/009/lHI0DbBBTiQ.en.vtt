well<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:19.450> you're<00:01:19.719> only<00:01:19.840> gonna<00:01:20.170> cause<00:01:20.439> a

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
well then you're only gonna cause a

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.130 
well then you're only gonna cause a
thread<00:01:20.799> on<00:01:20.950> these<00:01:21.250> two<00:01:21.430> switches<00:01:21.899> right<00:01:22.899> folks

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140
