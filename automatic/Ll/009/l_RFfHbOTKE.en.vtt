00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
this and you can soak without salt but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679 
this and you can soak without salt but
salted<00:01:36.659> water<00:01:36.900> seems<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> work<00:01:37.920> better<00:01:38.689> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
salted water seems to work better and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:51.640 
salted water seems to work better and
again<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> give<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> stir

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
usually let it soak 8 to 10 hours in the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.510 
usually let it soak 8 to 10 hours in the
morning<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.630> take<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.960> off<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.530> they'll<00:02:19.370> be

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
morning and take it off and they'll be

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.180 
morning and take it off and they'll be
done<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.730> we<00:02:23.150> will<00:02:23.360> take<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:24.190> dehydrator

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
done and then we will take a dehydrator

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.980 
done and then we will take a dehydrator
tray<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.610> use<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> dehydrator<00:02:26.210> or<00:02:26.600> an<00:02:26.870> oven

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
tray you can use a dehydrator or an oven

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.160 
tray you can use a dehydrator or an oven
but<00:02:27.800> here's<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.130> dehydrator<00:02:28.790> tray<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.960> just

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
but here's a dehydrator tray and it just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.310 
but here's a dehydrator tray and it just
has<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> mesh<00:02:30.650> screen<00:02:31.100> on<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:33.170> can

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
has the mesh screen on it and you can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.600 
has the mesh screen on it and you can
see<00:02:33.560> it's<00:02:33.830> like<00:02:34.220> porous<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.550> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
see it's like porous and so I'm going to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.250 
see it's like porous and so I'm going to
spread<00:02:37.910> those<00:02:38.060> out<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.780> then<00:02:38.870> put<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.110> my

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
spread those out and then put it my

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.820 
spread those out and then put it my
dehydrator<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:42.290> until<00:02:42.560> they're<00:02:42.680> dry

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
dehydrator and go until they're dry

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.700 
dehydrator and go until they're dry
somewhere<00:02:43.460> around<00:02:43.550> 12<00:02:44.030> hours<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
somewhere around 12 hours and and I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.850 
somewhere around 12 hours and and I
usually<00:02:46.070> set<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> about<00:02:46.550> 105<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.570> 110<00:02:47.860> lower

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
usually set it about 105 to 110 lower

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.370 
usually set it about 105 to 110 lower
than<00:02:49.190> 115<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> enzymes<00:02:50.870> are<00:02:51.170> still

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
than 115 so that the enzymes are still

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.930 
than 115 so that the enzymes are still
intact<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.210> um<00:02:54.250> these<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.520> just<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
intact so um these are just going to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.720 
intact so um these are just going to
soak<00:02:56.150> overnight<00:02:56.600> um<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.980> we'll<00:02:58.400> see<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.640> in

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
soak overnight um and we'll see you in

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.330 
soak overnight um and we'll see you in
the<00:02:58.850> dehydrator<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.660> minute<00:02:59.900> okay<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:00.950> here

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
the dehydrator in a minute okay so here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.990 
the dehydrator in a minute okay so here
they<00:03:01.489> all<00:03:01.640> are

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
they all are

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.240 
they all are
loaded<00:03:02.690> in<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.900> dehydrator<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.620> drain<00:03:03.920> then

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
loaded in the dehydrator of drain then

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.910 
loaded in the dehydrator of drain then
in<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.820> morning<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.570> they're<00:03:06.500> loaded<00:03:06.709> on

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
in the morning and they're loaded on

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.280 
in the morning and they're loaded on
trays<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.220> have<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.610> mixed<00:03:08.060> not<00:03:08.360> one<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.080> then

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
trays I have a mixed not one and then

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.680 
trays I have a mixed not one and then
each<00:03:09.590> individual<00:03:10.250> kind<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.700> nut<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.450> we'll<00:03:11.540> see

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
each individual kind of nut so we'll see

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.260 
each individual kind of nut so we'll see
you<00:03:11.720> when<00:03:11.870> they're<00:03:11.989> done<00:03:12.280> okay<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:13.760> you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
you when they're done okay so now you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.090 
you when they're done okay so now you
can<00:03:14.390> tell<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.840> dehydrator<00:03:15.590> tray<00:03:15.800> these

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
can tell on the dehydrator tray these

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.870 
can tell on the dehydrator tray these
are<00:03:16.630> nuts<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.900> are<00:03:17.959> done<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.739> I've<00:03:19.640> taken

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
are nuts that are done and I've taken

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.229 
are nuts that are done and I've taken
some<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.750> made<00:03:21.620> nut<00:03:22.130> butter<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.520> well<00:03:22.610> that's

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
some and made nut butter as well that's

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.670

something<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.560> your

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
something that you can do just in your

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.660 
something that you can do just in your
food<00:03:24.860> processor<00:03:25.100> or<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:26.660> blender<00:03:26.739> or<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.010> Vitamix

food processor or a blender or a Vitamix

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.470 
food processor or a blender or a Vitamix
and<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:30.770> can<00:03:30.950> use<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> little<00:03:31.459> coconut<00:03:31.970> oil<00:03:32.209> or

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
and you can use a little coconut oil or

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080 
and you can use a little coconut oil or
something<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:34.489> make<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.700> blend

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
something like that to make it blend

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.140 
something like that to make it blend
easier<00:03:35.570> if<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.810> needs<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.880> great

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
easier if it needs to but it's a great

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.759 
easier if it needs to but it's a great
