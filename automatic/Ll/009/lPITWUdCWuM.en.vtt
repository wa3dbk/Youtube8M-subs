00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
orange is pretty flat and dead-looking

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.570 
orange is pretty flat and dead-looking
not<00:01:36.009> for<00:01:36.280> long<00:01:36.460> with<00:01:36.729> this<00:01:36.880> quick<00:01:37.509> crimson<00:01:38.580> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
not for long with this quick crimson and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.240 
not for long with this quick crimson and
I<00:01:39.729> would<00:01:39.880> use<00:01:40.119> Quinn<00:01:40.929> crimson<00:01:41.500> or<00:01:41.740> alizarin

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
I would use Quinn crimson or alizarin

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.150 
I would use Quinn crimson or alizarin
crimson<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.350> versus<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.500> purple<00:01:44.890> just

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
crimson for this versus the purple just

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.410 
crimson for this versus the purple just
because<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.759> doesn't<00:01:46.300> have<00:01:46.740> enough<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:50.229> combat

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
because it doesn't have enough to combat

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.440 
because it doesn't have enough to combat
the<00:01:52.420> blue<00:01:53.070> remember<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.190> talked<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:55.060> doesn't

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the blue remember we talked it doesn't

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.700 
the blue remember we talked it doesn't
shine<00:01:55.660> in<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.869> dark<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.860> those<00:01:57.039> dark<00:01:58.710> segments

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
shine in the dark so those dark segments
