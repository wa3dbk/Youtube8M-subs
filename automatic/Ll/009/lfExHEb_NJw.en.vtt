so<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:57.180> wasn't<00:03:57.480> disgraceful<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.110> guess<00:03:58.320> then<00:03:59.250> we

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so it wasn't disgraceful I guess then we

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.759 
so it wasn't disgraceful I guess then we
got<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.670> first<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.600> front<00:04:01.019> three<00:04:01.440> and
