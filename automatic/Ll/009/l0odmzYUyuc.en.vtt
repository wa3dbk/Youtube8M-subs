00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
leg is visible now this guy at this game

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.729 
leg is visible now this guy at this game
um<00:00:34.290> legs<00:00:35.160> initially<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.300> times<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:37.559> it's

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
um legs initially at times when it's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
um legs initially at times when it's
still<00:00:38.160> downloading<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.210> data<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:40.320> should

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
still downloading the data that should

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.930 
still downloading the data that should
not<00:00:40.770> continue<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.670> long<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> honor<00:00:44.579> 6

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
not continue for so long so the honor 6

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.880 
not continue for so long so the honor 6
actually<00:00:45.980> legs<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> becoming<00:00:49.530> slightly

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually legs is it becoming slightly

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
actually legs is it becoming slightly
smooth<00:00:50.489> enough<00:00:51.739> could<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:59.719> think<00:01:00.719> it's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
smooth enough could be i think it's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200 
smooth enough could be i think it's
becoming<00:01:01.350> slightly<00:01:01.980> smoother<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:02.969> still

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
becoming slightly smoother but still

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.219 
becoming slightly smoother but still
there<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> lag<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.589> exists<00:01:05.129> constantly

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
there is a lag that exists constantly

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.940 
there is a lag that exists constantly
next<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> asphalt<00:01:07.830> 8<00:01:08.040> let's<00:01:08.850> say<00:01:09.830> it's<00:01:10.830> very

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
next is asphalt 8 let's say it's very

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:33.410 
next is asphalt 8 let's say it's very
slight<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.810> well

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.620 

don't<00:01:34.420> define<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:37.950> guess<00:01:38.970> did<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.090> speak<00:01:40.330> too

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
don't define I guess did I speak too

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:53.330 
don't define I guess did I speak too
quickly

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.050 

I<00:01:53.399> guess<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.299> fine<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.079> don't<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.100> any

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I guess it's fine now I don't see any

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:18.320 
I guess it's fine now I don't see any
leg<00:01:58.250> right<00:01:59.250> now

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.480 

no<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.170> deliberately<00:02:19.620> trying<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.250> go

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
no time deliberately trying to go

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.670 
no time deliberately trying to go
offload<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.300> see<00:02:21.510> how<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> performs<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
offload to see how it performs the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.990 
offload to see how it performs the
maneuvers<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.340> other<00:02:23.520> things<00:02:31.700> because<00:02:32.700> it's

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
maneuvers and other things because it's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
maneuvers and other things because it's
the<00:02:33.120> impacts<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.870> all<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.380> gives

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the impacts and all that actually gives

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.470 
the impacts and all that actually gives
a<00:02:35.550> true<00:02:35.820> sense<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.390> how<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:38.330> graphics<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
a true sense of how the graphics is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
a true sense of how the graphics is
performing<00:02:45.740> smooth<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:46.980> far<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.010> I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
performing smooth so far so I think I

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.400 
performing smooth so far so I think I
saw<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.240> slight<00:02:51.480> lag<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> game

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
saw just a slight lag when the game

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.400 
saw just a slight lag when the game
started<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:53.520> now<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.410> perfectly

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
started but then now it's perfectly

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.180 
started but then now it's perfectly
smooth<00:02:56.090> no<00:02:57.090> leg<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:58.500> not<00:02:58.620> skipping<00:02:59.010> any

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
smooth no leg it's not skipping any

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
smooth no leg it's not skipping any
frames<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.370> Exide<00:03:08.970> starting<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.570> heat<00:03:09.720> up

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
frames the Exide starting to heat up

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:21.059 
frames the Exide starting to heat up
just<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.530> little

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.740 

Oh

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:37.910 

yeah<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.620> smooth<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.130> far<00:03:28.080> Nova<00:03:29.080> tree<00:03:29.320> next

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:50.580 

animation<00:03:38.920> looks<00:03:39.310> fine<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.150> far

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.369 

it's<00:03:51.590> keeping<00:03:52.159> very<00:03:52.790> very<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:55.549> our<00:03:56.379> little

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
it's keeping very very like our little

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:10.720 
it's keeping very very like our little
frames<00:04:00.010> but<00:04:01.010> not<00:04:01.159> much

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:23.460 

pretty<00:04:11.730> cool<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.090> far<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.870> let's<00:04:13.049> roll

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:42.399 

fine<00:04:24.470> fast<00:04:25.130> enough<00:04:28.480> no<00:04:29.480> leg<00:04:29.830> smooth

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:52.150 

all<00:04:42.949> right<00:04:43.279> let's<00:04:43.879> slide

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.640 

so<00:04:53.160> it's<00:04:53.280> playing<00:04:53.520> good<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:53.970> far<00:04:54.470> let's<00:04:55.470> see

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
so it's playing good so far let's see

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:09.300 
so it's playing good so far let's see
how<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.190> shooting<00:04:56.550> experience<00:04:57.060> is

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:19.270

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.410 

smooth<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.360> far

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
smooth so far

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:36.890 
smooth so far

when<00:05:37.530> you<00:05:37.680> see<00:05:37.889> it's<00:05:38.190> very<00:05:38.310> very<00:05:39.270> smooth<00:05:39.690> now

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.279 

yep<00:06:21.690> absolutely<00:06:22.370> smooth<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.090> are<00:06:24.569> led

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
yep absolutely smooth so it are led

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.279 
yep absolutely smooth so it are led

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
Nova tree and asphalt a pretty smoothly

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.950 
Nova tree and asphalt a pretty smoothly
and<00:06:31.130> although<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.280> backside<00:06:32.819> just<00:06:33.750> about

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960
