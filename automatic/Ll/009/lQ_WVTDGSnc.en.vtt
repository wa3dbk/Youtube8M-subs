finger on c-sharp so you got that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.410

position<00:00:48.230> second<00:00:49.230> position<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:50.090> right<00:00:51.090> hand

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
position second position is right hand

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.639 
position second position is right hand
comes<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:53.120> which<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.270> f<00:00:54.480> sharp<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.079> and

comes into there which is f sharp a and
D<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.399> that's<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.000> hang<00:00:57.300> on

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
D I think that's right hang on

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.600 
D I think that's right hang on
yeah<00:00:59.780> that's<00:01:00.080> it<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.710> your<00:01:00.920> right<00:01:01.100> hand<00:01:01.160> goes

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
goes from C sharp up to D so you're

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.700 
goes from C sharp up to D so you're
going<00:01:15.770> from<00:01:15.860> there<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:17.420> bit<00:01:18.410> hard<00:01:18.590> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
going from there to there bit hard to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.180 
going from there to there bit hard to
see<00:01:19.010> it<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:20.450> C<00:01:20.630> sharp<00:01:20.900> 2nd<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.530> 4th<00:01:21.740> finger

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
see it a and C sharp 2nd and 4th finger

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.110 
see it a and C sharp 2nd and 4th finger
to<00:01:22.670> 1st<00:01:23.420> 2nd<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:23.990> 5th<00:01:24.740> finger<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:25.580> that's<00:01:25.850> in

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
to 1st 2nd and 5th finger so that's in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.050 
to 1st 2nd and 5th finger so that's in
and<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.230> left<00:01:27.410> hand<00:01:27.760> we're<00:01:28.760> doing<00:01:28.970> a

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and in the left hand we're doing a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.580 
and in the left hand we're doing a
little<00:01:29.180> bit<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.170> there's<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> little

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
little bit of that but there's a little

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.570 
little bit of that but there's a little
bit<00:01:30.680> more<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:31.430> position<00:01:32.150> 1<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.450> here

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
bit more to it so position 1 is here

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.440 
bit more to it so position 1 is here
position<00:01:34.580> 2

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
position 2

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.280 
position 2
I<00:01:36.539> think<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.020 

you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.280 

while<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.119> left<00:01:44.240> hand<00:01:44.360> stays<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.869> same<00:01:44.900> it's

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
while the left hand stays the same it's

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:57.760 
while the left hand stays the same it's
just<00:01:45.350> on<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:45.979> E<00:01:46.189> so

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.010 

that's<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> introduction<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.850> let's<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.900> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that's the introduction so let's do it a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.810 
that's the introduction so let's do it a
little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.290> slower<00:02:01.500> Darryl

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.000 

slower

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.670 

got<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.190> I'll<00:02:16.430> do<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.700> again<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.320> start

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
got that I'll do it again so you start

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.290 
got that I'll do it again so you start
with<00:02:18.770> those<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.550> bounce<00:02:19.910> under<00:02:20.210> this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
with those and then bounce under this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
with those and then bounce under this
guy

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.510 

you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
you

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:49.260 
you
