00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
now we're swinging around to the right

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.900 
now we're swinging around to the right
coming<00:00:54.700> back<00:00:55.030> along<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.480> ridge<00:00:55.660> again<00:00:55.989> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
coming back along the ridge again and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.700 
coming back along the ridge again and
heading<00:00:57.910> right<00:00:58.090> back<00:00:58.420> toward<00:00:58.870> our<00:00:59.440> launch

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
heading right back toward our launch

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.530 
heading right back toward our launch
point<00:00:59.980> for<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.280> moment

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.230 

what<00:01:05.540> maybe<00:01:05.830> 20<00:01:06.830> 30<00:01:07.100> yards<00:01:07.340> over<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.820> treetops

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
what maybe 20 30 yards over the treetops

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.460 
what maybe 20 30 yards over the treetops
at<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.570> point<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.200> there's<00:01:09.380> this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
at this point so there's this

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.490 
at this point so there's this
combination<00:01:10.130> right<00:01:10.280> now<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.900> exhilaration<00:01:11.900> of

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
combination right now of exhilaration of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.660 
combination right now of exhilaration of
flying<00:01:13.450> but<00:01:14.450> also<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.890> technique<00:01:16.400> of<00:01:16.550> it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
flying but also the technique of it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.450 
flying but also the technique of it
thinking<00:01:17.030> real<00:01:17.210> hard<00:01:17.510> about<00:01:17.630> where<00:01:18.020> we<00:01:18.200> are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
thinking real hard about where we are

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.570 
thinking real hard about where we are
feeling<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.490> environment<00:01:20.120> feeling<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.690> wind

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
feeling the environment feeling the wind

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.210 
feeling the environment feeling the wind
so<00:01:22.580> we<00:01:22.700> did<00:01:22.910> a<00:01:23.270> few<00:01:23.570> s<00:01:24.020> turns<00:01:24.440> right<00:01:24.830> along<00:01:25.070> the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
so we did a few s turns right along the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.770 
so we did a few s turns right along the
ridge<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.880> get<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.060> little<00:01:26.210> lift<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.750> now

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
ridge to get a little lift and now

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.960 
ridge to get a little lift and now
looking<00:01:27.440> down<00:01:27.620> on<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.890> town<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.250> Aspen<00:01:28.670> what

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
about 2,000 feet down below us at this

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
about 2,000 feet down below us at this
point<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:35.150> is<00:01:35.300> an<00:01:35.420> incredible<00:01:36.200> feeling
