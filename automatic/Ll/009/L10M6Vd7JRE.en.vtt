00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.590
 good girls that as they are 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.219
 welcome another day to my channel and 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.150
 well this time I'm going to do the 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:23.529
 review or review of this base that is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.460
 from north and this is the base of numbers 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:31.810
 way laws so this base is not 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.480
 you know very light also comes in 20 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.760
 tones since it is a very open range very 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 Complete for all types of skin color 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.250
 and good girls this base is super good 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.210
 over for oily skin since it does not 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.910
 contains oils is water based and 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.100
 this is not very advisable to girls 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.800
 have dry skin since you can 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.220
 put between the folds they also 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.190
 I mean it does not contain colored 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.290
 When applied it has no smell and you can see that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.350
 there are some bases that smell very rich 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.350
 like that of moss chanel that base has a 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:17.409
 Very nice smell I also want to tell you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 I'm using the average one is one 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.390
 that I have a color that colors me 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.600
 Brown 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.030
 I have mixed skin this part of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.659
 here I have a little fat to the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.520
 move from the day and the pse to the area of ​​the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.990
 I have a little thank you and the rest is 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.140
 dry that I really liked this 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.110
 a lot because it already covers the face a lot 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.470
 covers it only with a tip or two 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.450
 we already have full and good coverage 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.700
 the truth that I'm going to keep it 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.000
 because the truth to me yes I liked it a lot 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.340
 right now I 'm wearing it and I 'm not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.430
 I feel with that weight that we sometimes feel 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.229
 with me I feel a little more weight with 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.470
 the law max since it is so is very thick and 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.690
 I feel it in the face yes very heavy and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.750
 that's not it feels very light as if 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 do not want anything the truth is the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.950
 I recommend a lot 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.200
 it also comes in this is a very packaging 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.069
 very pretty 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.860
 and this is the box and it has the price of 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.349
 48 dollars that the truth if I was made 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.690
 a little expensive but it's worth it 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.420
 invest in a good foundation since it does not 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.550
 we will be applying every day and 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.290
 well more trains comes to you 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.530
 like 57 dollars or so and this what 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.790
 find in sex now this one 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.400
 find in sephora 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.000
 I think and it's the only place I do not know if you like 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.079
 I have it but the truth is that I 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 loved it happens to me I did not like it very much 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:07.450
 how I feel it as it adhered me then 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.409
 then on the face aside from that it's very 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.989
 very liquid and we have to beat the very 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.480
 well at the time of shaking since as it is 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.450
 based on water then does not concentrate 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.040
 but we do not want to be a color and 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.920
 from another one here then it 's very 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.290
 important that we kill her very 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.230
 well before applying it and apply it 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.290
 with a sponge I use the viura and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.569
 blender and I use moisture since I 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.629
 It gives a very very very natural finish 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.120
 also so that I do not get between the 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:45.019
 folds in the parts that I have dry 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.870
 and I use a first use before 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.080
 before a timer so that I put that 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.420
 layer and then well I have a finish 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.120
 nice and do not get between the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.540
 folds and you can not see those wrinkles 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.840
 that all or say in this part of 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.599
 where I smile a lot I get a 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.420
 tortilla to knee then well no 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.099
 I want to see myself as a true old lady 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.379
 then it is the most recommended if 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.069
 you have mixed skin and if you have skin 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.070
 dry 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.019
 then get away from her no no the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.959
 buy because I do not advise you but 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.449
 that you are going to get a lot then 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.240
 let's see how I 'm applying it and 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.810
 everything and then we go back ok 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.810
 bye 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.090
 they are using a maig first and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.370
 that this is going to prepare my face and the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.229
 skin for the application of the base and 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.770
 that this softens the lines of expression 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:46.680
 for example around the eyes to 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.400
 side of the mouth and good since it gives a 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.159
 very very natural finish to the face with the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.039
 viura and wet blender I will be 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:59.099
 applying my base and I will beat very well 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.409
 the base to have a uniform color and 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.389
 I will be applying a little on my hand 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.120
 to later spread it all over the 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.190
 face with the help and blinden remember 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.780
 very well that it has to be wet for 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.759
 that gives that beautiful and uniform finish and 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.289
 that looks very natural and we do not see each other 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.289
 too many charged 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.490
 good if you 're a girl who's just going 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.620
 to start applying makeup just start 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.480
 in this of makeup in the box 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.810
 of information I'm going to leave you to 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.510
 step as I apply my base of 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.700
 makeup as I prepare the face and 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.220
 well, girls, let's not forget we have 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.380
 that our base disappear very well 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.170
 about the entrances of our hair or 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.620
 the birth of the hair so that 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.920
 do not look like a mask type very well 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.320
 by the neck so that this would be the 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.200
 uniform tone these will I be 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.330
 applying this mac fix on the lip 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.580
 and blender since this one is going to give me a 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.510
 very natural finish and I will be 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.430
 removing excess makeup is going to 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.860
 remove what I do not need and I'm going to 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.280
 make see that effect that looks more 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.600
 natural and we do not see ourselves very charged 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.840
 coming back here they saw how I 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.330

 everything and I also want to tell you that this 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.070

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.560
 part of the tip and the little bomb comes 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.350
 costing about 8 or 10 dollars more or 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.870
 less then well maybe that's why it's 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.630
