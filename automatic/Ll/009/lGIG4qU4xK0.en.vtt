00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.610
 Good day dear friends with 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.619
 you yar and night and this video at least 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.210
 to present a decision contest unusually 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.490
 chess tasks second part first 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.740
 position before us 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.520
 shah white king care here whites 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.310
 however the assignment is quite interesting she 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.190
 It sounds like Blackâ€™s last move 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.230
 this position position which we see 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.250
 problem number two 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.760
 which sense is our rook 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.210
 any of our rooks can get to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 fields and one for 4 moves 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.840
 let's try e4 again elephant six 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.890
 planets on the 6th and 5th 6th end of the 3rd diabetes 5 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.439
 King f1 and that's the purpose of tasks performed 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.810
 however, five moves passed again as 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.979
 any of our rook can get to the pain 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.420
 and one in just 4 moves for both 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.810
 the parties are naturally arbitrary task 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.299
 from Yar Sanich number three 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.090
 need to do for both sides arbitrary 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.630
 moves and put the black king on 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 sixth year mate move castling in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 long side moves for both sides 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.369
 arbitrary, you can do anything 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.679
 but on the sixth move White must have a rocker 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.669
 go to the long side 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:50.689
 checkmate to black king and finally last 

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:53.169
 task most difficult objective of which is 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.880
 to put a black mate in 4 moves 

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:58.789
 If you put this task on the mine 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.889
 program of course she is a motor of 4 to not 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.989
 will show will mate in 5 moves 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.290
 that is, here it is necessary to break 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.710
 head yourself 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.190
 and most importantly understand why on the board 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.440
 such a large number of pawns already 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.620
 here is not up enough only 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.350
 chess decisions need to think more 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.110
 what have you got 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.600
 many pawns on the line as much as the task 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 unusual but here everything is within 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.450
 chess rules look forward to 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.840
