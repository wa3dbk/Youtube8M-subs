00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.559
 Okan ZEV known I think that saves calling for the 2 3 so 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.359
 so easy times 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.749
 Approach that there will be more 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.439
 and I do not know even close 2 3 NP 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.210
 So for that I think rather in the gate he thanks, he does not quote now 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.989
 i would like my data to be i want to look where i am 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.989
 I start to wait for Spitz 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.550
 Dirt smell 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.169
 Aris is Fraport or 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.700
 Bob what should 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.050
 Occean start shot Jacobsen others in the flood areas RP percent 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 important bull that he still so far but I have mine that was just that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.059
 apparently too 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.559
 Affected Plath on the game completed what and why appears 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.180
 which but apple users 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.410
 no matter 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.760
 Fuck Odenthal percent 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.990
 now it is better to put into play a technical defect of a prisoner 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.080
 Levy eleven wins out of six market I Ruby the two weapons Blanchett of me 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.810
 yet my players have so 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.420
 he played Superman through but could be thinner 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.080
 Smith wants run-up wins of the report mine 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 that's why Brooks did not really do much on Skype 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.060
 Nestlé can double as opportunism as race racing sweat 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.960
 soak 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.830
 yes, yes, that's a certain value for the city. "That's the way it is 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.390
 Credits she would not have done 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.200
 such details for the injured then moved on to expect something different 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 Silverlight 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.290
 where the dubbing influence if you could do it in Apple's App Store 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.100
 found away 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 the highest risk is 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.250
 So I still have the whole life 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.480
 I think if it was clean, nothing was honored 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.300
 do Kießling 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.680
 when I became so passionate 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 and I want to have everything helped behavior 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.840
 Alright, I did not have anything I had the slightest preference for today because 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.080
 I've had enough life because of that 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 Percent but if I now use my wife to close the profession 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 German threat we stand on the side 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.600
 such a highlight being all that means I can over the service the bike 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.420
 die z but if also Fraport fits in very well with the small one 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.649
 But be of life and Wagner are the harbinger of what I mean 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.439
 NWR play so Bernhardt just use it I mean it already 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.959
 heavy Bromwich opponent maybe 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.209
 in the north Animas of India the bosses Flat little more still 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.480
 more than ever we could have and have smarter skills 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 but otherwise can recommend sponsors to 9 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.939
 2 given with food because actual 9 dec of 9 6 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.999
 because the actual taken with two applications and the terms used and 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.439
 you can get 6 at Songs for the Coffee 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.040
 But the role is important for the main game of 1 the way leads 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.439
 the way for the 4 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.779
 APA you realize that now he has what I have to start the studied pharmacist 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.379
 delight 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.899
 Maybe nothing to lose and want 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:07.659
 Both candidates thereby heats applicants a candidate owns a Porsche 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.429

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:13.649
 that had as reported 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.399
 but it is not that bad 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 Occupational accident of 1 10% now represents called 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.900
 and Bernhard Gruber himself 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 and continue 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.979
 yes why not why is it now possible Tettamanti were too 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.209
 Beech why do all the shit again 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.209
 Willibald Späth 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 because I have to see the love of Christ the basic form comes the evening as me 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.449

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.180
 redeemed here until the whole shit comes the track that now everything once 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.419
 front 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.950

 this has been hard at the beginning but then 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.269

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.759
 Running co-trainer 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.999
