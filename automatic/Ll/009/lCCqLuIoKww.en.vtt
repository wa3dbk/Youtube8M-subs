00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
BB cream I've done a fast-approaching

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.939 
BB cream I've done a fast-approaching
sort<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.369> type<00:00:26.880> video<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.380> came<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
sort of type video on this I came to the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.380 
sort of type video on this I came to the
conclusion<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.660> liked<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:32.390> okay

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
conclusion that I really liked it okay

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
conclusion that I really liked it okay
so<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:34.020> rub<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:34.980> fingers

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
so I just rub this in with my fingers

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.360 
so I just rub this in with my fingers
now<00:00:35.870> with<00:00:36.870> BB<00:00:37.140> creams<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> can't<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.070> use

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
now with BB creams you can't really use

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.729 
now with BB creams you can't really use
a<00:00:38.579> brush<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.230> you'll<00:00:40.500> lose

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
a brush because if you do you'll lose

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.549 
a brush because if you do you'll lose
that<00:00:41.360> coverage<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.110> I'm<00:00:43.230> using<00:00:43.440> my

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that coverage so and so I'm using my

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.270 
that coverage so and so I'm using my
fingers

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.180

this is the one with Susilo Kassadin by
the<00:00:52.250> way<00:00:52.399> because<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.120> obviously<00:00:53.390> have<00:00:53.780> acne

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079

you

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.910 

then<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.000> usually<00:01:53.210> set<00:01:53.899> my<00:01:54.020> face<00:01:54.229> with<00:01:54.649> a

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
then I usually set my face with a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.740 
then I usually set my face with a
setting<00:01:55.579> powder<00:01:55.609> and<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.210> memory<00:01:56.450> using<00:01:56.600> my

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
setting powder and I memory using my

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.810 
setting powder and I memory using my
Napoleon<00:01:57.289> ready<00:01:57.649> set<00:01:57.829> loose<00:01:58.070> powder<00:01:58.369> today

Napoleon ready set loose powder today

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.929 
Napoleon ready set loose powder today
the<00:01:59.270> actual<00:01:59.539> powder<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:00.409> very<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.100> good<00:02:01.219> but

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
the actual powder is very very good but

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.599 
the actual powder is very very good but
the<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.450> complaint<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.350> have<00:02:03.530> about<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.280> the

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
the one complaint I have about it is the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.819 
the one complaint I have about it is the
packaging<00:02:05.119> because<00:02:05.509> it's<00:02:06.229> as<00:02:06.469> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.710> see

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
packaging because it's as you can see

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.770 
packaging because it's as you can see
it's<00:02:06.950> really<00:02:07.069> small<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.579> awkward<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.300> get<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
it's really small and awkward to get a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's really small and awkward to get a
brush<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.920> there

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.559 

you

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.259 

this<00:02:22.379> step<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.620> completed<00:02:23.159> I<00:02:23.459> usually<00:02:23.609> go<00:02:23.969> back

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
this step is completed I usually go back

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.660 
this step is completed I usually go back
into<00:02:24.510> concealer<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> see<00:02:25.920> where<00:02:26.249> exactly

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
into concealer just to see where exactly

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.239 
into concealer just to see where exactly
I<00:02:26.909> need<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.540> extra<00:02:27.900> coverage<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.099> just

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:29.249 
I need that extra coverage so I'm just

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:35.030 
I need that extra coverage so I'm just
going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.459> cover<00:02:29.639> up<00:02:29.879> there's<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:31.260> spot<00:02:34.040> but

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
going to cover up there's one spot but

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.690 
going to cover up there's one spot but
picking<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:35.700> up

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 

and<00:02:42.819> then<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.780> again<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.709> pulling<00:02:45.040> those<00:02:45.129> out

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
and then I again just pulling those out

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.199 
and then I again just pulling those out
my<00:02:45.640> finger<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.330> feel<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.400> use<00:02:48.610> my<00:02:48.819> finger

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
my finger I feel that if I use my finger

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.300
