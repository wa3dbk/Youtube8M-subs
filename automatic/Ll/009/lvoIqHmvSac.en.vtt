00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 pay all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.790
 those two on the server or today for the corner 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.440
 of technology we are going to talk about 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.390
 a business that we bought in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.210
 double copy one for me and one for reds 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.490
 which is called many mix 4 usb product 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 from alexis is a little thing that there is the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.630
 risotto not a few problems and that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.189
 it could also be useful to you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 the first problem we solved 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.870
 thanks to this multi mix is ​​the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 possibility of recording with two 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.129
 microphones attached online in all 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.690
 phantom attack even with the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.850
 possibility to feed this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 exact attack therefore which one speaks of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 two balanced xlr channels that therefore 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.510
 this is fine for microphones 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.250
 what it meant for us in the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 specific we had the problem that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 when we played in the same place 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 so not online but right in the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.420
 same room with two computers la 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.100
 Gameplay recording was not the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 maximum because we had to use only one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 microphone putting it between us was not 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.790
 the best because we were rather 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 distant with this multi mix 4 at 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.869
 end we can use two microphones and the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.049
 sound is cleaner and yes and above all 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.630
 we can even balance them with a right and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.640
 a left depending on how it turns to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 us thanks to these simple 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.720
 potentiometers obviously in the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 power ups we could also equalize 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
 good sound but why we talk about it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.229
 this little object in the end because it is there 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 even inside an integrated sound card 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.880
 and external then exact usb attacking 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.350
 this usb to your pc 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.509
 will become exactly a sound card 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.400
 external however a sound card that gives us 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.350
 the opportunity to mix different 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.229
 input signals and this is one thing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.530
 very useful in your case yours 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 game station includes a PC a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.899
 xbox or maybe two PCs or imported from a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.810
 fixed because with the mixer you can do 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.670
 merge all audio outputs e 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.150
 one source of reproduction 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 from the large 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.050
 a single stereo system that plays 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.550
 both the xbox and the computer 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.399
 yes this is a very important thing 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.619
 guys because you can manage the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.020
 through a simple potentiometer 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.360
 turn on the xbox turn on the potential 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.040
 but turn off the xbox and maybe move 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.630
 directly the lever and you have done 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 without you buying yourself in ten facilities 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.430
 audio 10 headphones because you don't want to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.230
 attack them very very pretty a lot 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.210
 very convenient among other things the first one 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.750
 entry if l was the first channel this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.090
 here also a switch that allows us in the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.340
 case it connects us with a guitar a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.130
 low something like the switch area 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.680
 a high exit at an entrance excuse us in 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.020
 high impedance therefore even better 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.510
 because we can also do music yes 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.640
 is then this mix is ​​linen is one thing 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 interesting and above all today 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.170
 since on your desk but have 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
 definitely present a console or a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.000
 phone where you have music an ipod 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.740
 whatever you want you can safely 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.750
 attach everything to this little thing here and 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.850
 we also wanted to show it to you 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.120
 if an object that maybe is a niche 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.850
 because many have asked us this 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.640
 this thing maybe one switch names 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 it was only used to convey the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.300
 sound right or left but with this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 solve all the problems you have 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.470
 extra sound card at one place 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.080
 really affordable from years ago in 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.700
 actually we have seen several online and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.709
 this is the one that actually has the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.410
 more affordable price 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.450
 and in fact it is not that it has all 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.510
 these because the second major flaw 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.100
 we are in the fact that there is no channel 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.050
 a muting button so you can't 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.940
 going to mount an ace for example not 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.459
 I want to change this tullow microphone 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.260
 you have to go and lower it by losing 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.120
 maybe the optimal volume you ask 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.130
 fixed for the registrations of the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.380
 gameplay to say then maybe with must 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.090
 get a cleat there where you know that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.709
 the volume is perfect because the site 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.310
 you want to change you have to lower everything 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.040
 this was from her 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.720
 last four we wanted to talk about it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.520
 also because it is such an object of 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.230
 niche that we personally do not 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.880
 we didn't even know this 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.489
 so what could come back 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.340
 definitely useful ok hoping this 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.140
 video has opened a new door there 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.650
 see you next we leave you the link 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.650
 below
