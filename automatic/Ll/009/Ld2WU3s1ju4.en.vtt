00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.239

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.190
 favorite product spider spider does everything 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.190
 what he produces spider spider 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.550
 since nobody would hold back to see 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 steven bleeding in the street 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.320
 the new spider-man reboot will not be 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.910
 a history of origin on the other hand 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.220
 besides confirming that we will see again 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.960
 a peter parker not yellow morals like 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.180
 some speculated he stated that he 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.940
 will be about a teenager of 15 or 16 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.660
 years and his life in high school 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.070
 definitely in contrast to the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.410
 other superiors of this universe do not 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.390

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.020
 He also confirmed that the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 Royal costume that will keep more style 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 classic that we like so much we will know 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 Suddenly want to play our 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.210
 friendly neighbor and while on that 'no 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.370
 be good your plan to put together your 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 universe is finally taking shape this 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.520
 week it was announced that the movie of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.860
 flash that will not be released until 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.330
 2018 and it's being developed by 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.650
 the directors of the lego movie 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.650
 chris miller and floor 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.030
 and it 's fine like that in the thing if warner and 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.800
 they want to take all the time from 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.590
 world to develop his films he 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.450
 we give them but please do it right ok 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 this is important to us 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.310
 and jumping from study to study 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.890
 with the fox and the highly anticipated film of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.360
 pet full remembers of that touch test of 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.740
 what could have been the movie of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.750
 deadpool that leaked a while ago 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.670
 well thanks to the reactions to this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.010
 Fox material was encouraged to give the green light 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.690
 with Ryan Reynolds giving him a well-deserved 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.370
 second opportunity to interpret 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.370
 white wilson as you said goodbye 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.640
 today a touch is missing more pages here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640
 production 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.549
 thanks as I said, they have already started 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.739
 filtering photographs of the filming of this 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.959
 movie premiered in February 2016 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.030
 written by the zombieland writers 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.099
 and directed by tim miller but the most 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 important with the confirmation that 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.849
 it will be a movie with restriction r 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.849
 Over 18 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.450
 the horse and see what he does 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.050
 and finally this weekend 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.300
 we were celebrating the day 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.700
 international table games with 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.870
 our rap friends edge and this was 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.800
 a little bit of what we saw nothing 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:19.050
 my note because everyone is playing 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:21.240
 and nobody is really a grouping of 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.430
 friends that met one day experience 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.310
 slightly from board games 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.080
 board games and at the time we 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.670
 he bit the bug for trying to expand 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.710
 the theme among our own friends 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.120
 one of the things that we opt for 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.850
 for board games is because the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.500
 Board games bring people closer 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.720
 The first issue that you will find is the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.850
 interrelation that can be generated with 2 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.730
 3 4 5 10 people around a 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.340
 board the second is the grace that 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.260
 You get to see the competition in 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.240
 live and live board games 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.510
 they also help you among many others 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.220
 things to improve the fine motor to improve 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.320
 the communication systems help you 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.020
 in logical environments they have environments 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.520
 Mathematicians improve you in every way 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.080
 as a human being at the moment of 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.580
 experiment and develop new 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.100
 ready experiences the games are 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.600
 totally free for all can all 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.950
 play the only thing they need is 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:17.100
 you feel like learning to want to play 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.190
 I want to laugh for a while 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.770
 necessary to see - Indian Mara spent everything 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.770
 led to win kicks 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.810
 and all for today do not forget to subscribe and 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.750
 leave us your comments and if you like 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.639
 I trained the link of our 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.449
 friends of the world reset we see the 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.449
 next week 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:56.659
 It's super sexy like that 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:05:00.159
 and jumping out of coffee house - 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.159
 to the cafe 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:09.900
 now 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.900
 come to 10,1 card come back 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.110
 I stopped seeing my work 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.100
 but that spider spider does everything 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.100
 can leave years 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.360
 perhaps
