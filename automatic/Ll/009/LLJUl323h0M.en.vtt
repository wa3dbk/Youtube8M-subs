our<00:03:09.560> point<00:03:09.739> loads<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.069> record<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.489> know<00:03:10.640> a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
our point loads of record and we know a

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.280 
our point loads of record and we know a

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
lot of that carries a envious of what

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.479 
lot of that carries a envious of what
we've<00:03:12.500> been<00:03:12.530> able<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.890> achieve

we've been able to achieve

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.400 
we've been able to achieve
I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.880> size<00:03:14.209> makes<00:03:14.510> us<00:03:14.630> more<00:03:14.810> nimble<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.290> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
I think size makes us more nimble but it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.110 
I think size makes us more nimble but it
certainly<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.489> people<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:16.819> make<00:03:16.910> the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
certainly is the people that make the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.670 
certainly is the people that make the
difference<00:03:17.209> because<00:03:17.630> everybody<00:03:18.170> has<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
difference because everybody has that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.490 
difference because everybody has that
BMI<00:03:19.069> spirit<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.579> we<00:03:20.150> do<00:03:20.269> carry<00:03:20.570> on<00:03:20.660> when<00:03:21.350> other

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500

that's<00:03:23.600> what<00:03:23.810> makes<00:03:24.019> us<00:03:24.140> different

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
that's what makes us different
