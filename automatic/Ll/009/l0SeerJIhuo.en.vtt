00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hey that such friends of youtube them 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.640
 beat to touch do not get away from me 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.230
 this song is originally by roberto 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.210
 Carlos, but I'll show you in the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 vicentico version since to me in what 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.230
 I particularly like Vicentico 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 from the fabulous already know that we have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 video demonstration of this side and lyrics 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.560
 and chords in christian bale puntocom 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.800
 down here in information so well 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.960
 let's start perfect application 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 standard on the guitar and the song is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.619
 simple most used two circles and a 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.619
 pure fast check I know how it is 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 to cover 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 for me 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.030
 ah 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.739
 let's use sun yes 7a 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.979
 and less 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.259
 seventh sun that number one finger what 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.680
 we went to the number one first fret 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.680
 rope 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:24.480
 king 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:26.100
 if I do not again my minor the minor and re 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.050
 that is the circle that gives the whole song 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.590
 let's start with the strumming that 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.280
 it is also very easy 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.940
 since nothing else is 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 Y 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.680
 down up hit again up the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.540
 blow we do it if they want with the pick or 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.540
 also if they can not with nails 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.950
 ok it depends on how you do it 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.690
 they can do it this way or with the door that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.690
 let's make it slow 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.180
 but practicing this speed we're going 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.690
 making it change with each chord 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.110
 so they go grab practice 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.110
 we start alone 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.790
 my minor 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 and second 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.489
 and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.750
 do not 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 king 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.090
 without minor 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.090
 and less 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 and the least 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830
 a king 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.780
 so I'm going to put the letter so that the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.160
 identify and we will go a little bit 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.800
 faster 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.800
 we started 321 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.270
 for me 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.380
 my minor 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.650
 single 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:51.540
 yes minor and minor 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.540
 the smallest to kill 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.150
 the choir part uses the same 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.570
 stanza circle the second circle 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.910
 it's exactly the same as it's going to 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.910
 put the letter 321 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.200
 the less so much to kill 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.650
 so so 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.310
 here we change to seventh sun and repeat 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310
 in percent 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.430
 on paper 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.419
 it's a very simple song but the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.280
 I really liked it a lot but it's good 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.199
 made out there a cover of this song 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.389
 but I did not like it and this one did 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.310
 vicentico in particular and I liked it 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.270
 very much whether they have the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.069
 comment 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.660
