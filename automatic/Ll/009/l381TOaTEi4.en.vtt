 I bring a video that will not be good 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.960
 very long the truth does not always 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.850
 roll up like a blind and in the end it's 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.970
 long but good today I'm with video 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.820
 that will not be the truth very of very 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.800
 funny nor very 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.830
 and peak that killed everyone because 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 I 'm not going to kill anyone today I'm going to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.430
 teach a pretty pretty thing and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 pretty funny how good I've been 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.529
 slow to get it but I like it 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.809
 very much 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.250
 well here I teach you I am of wisdom to 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.730
 a 693 I have nothing left for 194 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 7 xavi I have 800 good and wallace that gives 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.559
 just grew things mean you still 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.550
 I'm not from hosts I come to teach you 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.550
 this feat 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.270
 this is the cock 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.640
 the chrome globe 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.480
 and you will say I already know that there is I do not know 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.740
 what but it is that I invite you to what 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 you do 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.850
 for you to get it you do not know how 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 get it quiet that scared you and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 the solution I have a colleague and a German 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 what he has done well he did at the time 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 guide to get the blog cosmos and the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 It's really worth it, it's very good 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.070
 very good helper of these is that look 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.440
 low 4 pm and puts you in a state of mind 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 is this one does not lower it but we lower it retires 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.600
 very much to ivis that hit him from the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.760
 abyss but it hits a lot in this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.660
 spell dimensional failure transports you 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.040
 wherever it is in the range that lowers pm and is 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.280
 that is very well although dreams of years 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 of fixed water and remove pm and put it in 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 Been stuck already said it okay I think 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.050
 when I transport you where you end up 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.869
 leave a glyph of pm that glyph what 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.160
 is that when he hits him or she is not 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.180
 strike at the beginning of the turn hits the 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.300
 end of turn 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:04.690
 and if he hits him and when he hits him if he has 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.190
 moved on for example was here or 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.789
 he was anywhere and he gets here 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.130
 inside the tap will return to your site 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.400
 principle and pretty much hits the ife 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.070
 pretty pretty bad just started 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.630
 with tape let's read it teleports 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.280
 launcher systematically taking as 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.090
 reference your goal the clothes asks the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.500
 air element 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.970
 the pitcher returns to his position of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 beginning of shift at the end of his shift 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.340
 prevented the use of dimensional failure and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.650
 you see team stuck here a host stick 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.000
 pretty good a life I put myself here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.940
 and at the end of the shift 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.709
 I return to my site you have to be careful 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.570
 with that boy with the cross color always 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.030
 you stay buying because you see that their 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.790
 spells cost very few but very 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.200
 few that's the cock hands then no 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 blood and this been going very well for 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.220
 do what you are to take the ass 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.830
 let's put 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.710
 you're here that I think is the most 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.210
 you could be to paste the truth the 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.920
 division I always give davis I like it I am 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.650
 a panda I have to give of vis 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.640
 I'm here 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.049
 and uncle I want him not to hit me but 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.319
 I want to hit him easy I put you here 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.840
 you get him 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.389
 here the maximum range a tape me 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 teleportation here and since I'm by 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.900
 I'll give him a good fuck now my panda is going 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.650
 to put a beast but element of 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.239
 I put one here and another here plate 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.560
 it's much low a lot pm and ep and after 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.319
 you return to your site to take the ass that 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.319
 you are and you've gone down a lot of life is 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.250
 very well I will stop giving you vis 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.569
 another spell is killed this is very rare 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.250
 whoever matures spends 3p and steals from 21 to 24 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.349
 years of fire 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.719
 and retires for river plan is not this 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.379
 you talk like that it takes away stress for then 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:00.750
 you remove it again and it does not withdraw or it's just 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.030
 can steal 3 for at most and it's 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.879
 very good because the area of 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.400
 launch because your essence wins and that 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.169
 has one and it's a cross and it's very weird 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.359
 and somewhere in the middle I say where I'm going to 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.719
 throw it all is very well we go with 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.669
 disturbance in steals from 19 to 22 and pushes 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.870
 Two squares cause strip type damage 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.209
 and pushed the goals that are 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.340
 around throwing 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.319
 wins a spell that causes damage 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.509
 neutral in life robbery in each hit 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.280
 that receives melee during a 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.610
 turn let's see it 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.550
 I disturb him and he can be 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.840
 throw yourself with embarrassment environment and now 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.180
 goes the panda I say I am and I am going to hit you 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:48.500
 a moment file and hit him with and hit me 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:52.100
 242 load shit you shit because they're 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.960
 double damages a lot of karate 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.060
 and you think the panda has a record 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.889
 this spell puts this spell is 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.490
 Handsome 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.499
 And to end the detour, it gives you 300 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.360
 power to beat the 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:09.020
 enemies 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.750
 the element of this looks to stick 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.710
 more and apart 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.870
 when they stick the bread to the cosmos what 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.750
 will receive who has given to whom has 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.870
 given that is a sacrifice invested as 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.870
 says here the inverted sacrifice 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.699
 and not under once you have seen is very 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.050
 all right 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.990
 the latter is god 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.610
 and I this video is rather to do 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.349
 to show you that it is very good and that 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.020
 I invite you to get it if 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.599
 you want to get it I'll leave the links 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.650
 of the channel and the videos you have made 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.030
 to get the same one that ech 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:56.629
 affirm is it's not if you're level 157 in the 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.150
 set the 120 to the best you can also and 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.379

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.040
 that you will see in the channel 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.620
 but I invite you to get it because it's 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.980
 a very big help goes down a lot is pmp and 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.160
