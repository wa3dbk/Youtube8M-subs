00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.970
 ball to the wood before the goal 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.480

 in the set of Luis Enrique before the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 team of luis garcía tevenet el barça 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.260
 It took 20 minutes to open the can but 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.510
 When he did it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 scored again and again to leave the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.030
 match in 5 to 0 at the break 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 this is the play from 1 to 0 excellent the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.320
 center with the toe 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.720
 with the outside of munir 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.839
 that ends up delivering the ball to 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.680
 Peter in a regulatory situation receives 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.500
 a go and pedro almost falling to the ground 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.700
 get finished would be a first part 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.080
 wonderful of pedro that would make a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.690
 'hat-trick' then it would no longer enter the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.360
 second period 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.180
 we see the play again 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.250
 in which to unite with the outside of the foot 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.590
 left just delivering the ball to 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.229
 Pedro 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.570
 this would be the move from 2 to 0 iniesta 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.049
 for pedro it supports the exit of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 goalkeeper dani jiménez and the canary in 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.549
 the minute 26 marks the 2 to 0 is not very 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.469
 right there in the brand the defense of 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.259
 Huesca and that allows Pedro to take the 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.110
 ball and finish scoring by the stick 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.490

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 every time he arrived practically 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.500
 scored in the first period 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 elaborating the play by creating the play 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.720
 from 3 to 0 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.190
 many weeks absent played montoya 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.140
 right lateral in the first period and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.350
 left lateral in the second we saw 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.400
 the 3 to 0 with that execution of sergi 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 Roberto many touches for the play 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.560
 from 4 to 0 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.530
 in which iniesta with a self-control 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 spectacular with the school just 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.000
 resolving to 5 minutes to the end 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.670
 of the first period here we see again 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.590
 the play the pass of sergi roberto and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.160
 as iniesta with his left hand he scores this 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.610
 goal of Barcelona one more in the first 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.190
 period before the intervention of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.410
 goalkeeper dani jiménez the barça still 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.370
 would score one more goal in the first period 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.750
 it would be 5 to 0 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.990
 Pedro's action and shot 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.370
 very strong that sneaks below the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.950
 crossbar 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.050
 and what is supposed 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.910
 the last goal already of the first part 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.849
 receives Pedro prepares the shot with the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.580
 right and ends up hitting a lot 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.390
 forcefully watching the game from the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.220

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.040
 to occupy the right side step to 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.890
 left 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.890
 martín montoya who had this opportunity 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.569
 while Adriano Correia stood at 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.049
 right-winger adriano would end 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.250
 also marking in the second time 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.549

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.519
 6 to 0 on the scoreboard 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.519
 68 match minutes 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.140
 Adriano manages to finish from the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.290
 front of the area a ball that comes 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.210
 from midfield line on the diagonal 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.210
 of the 21 of Barcelona 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 you are going to press and take very 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.600
 serious this party recovering many 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.880
 balls that ended up propitiating plays 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 how is adama traoré the young 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.430
 canterano 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.430
 I would mark 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.610
 one more for the barça 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.410

 score 7 to 0 of Barcelona 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.030
 still sandro would have opportunity to 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.240
 mark also for the set 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.240
