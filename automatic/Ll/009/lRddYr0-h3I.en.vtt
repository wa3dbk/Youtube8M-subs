 [Music] 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.200
 and then we are there at the point of noon 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.469
 to take the first grab for 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.140
 try to go to the top of Mont Blanc 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.390
 to take off take off our sails from 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.490
 speed riding to arrive the fastest 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 possible 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.350
 place of the church so we took some 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.840
 mini sail 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.900
 of 8.9 square meters to try 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.710
 to go faster and beat the 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.600
 speed record 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.310
 so that was never it ever been 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.190
 made in port actually we had heard 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.930
 talk about it talking about records that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.270
 lots of people trying to beat at 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.510
 to ski by bike and it gave us 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.600
 the idea of ​​doing it with our sails 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.469
 who knew faster we had the idea I 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.339
 believe it's June 2013 and we did not 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.979
 could not do it because a 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.170
 flight ban on july august on 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.269
 the whole area mont blanc so we had to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.960
 wait and avoid talking about it and 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.220
 hope that no one can leave and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 and so here I think I have nobody 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.400
 who will be riding today we should 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.850
 to be the first is enough 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.409
 easily beat this time record is 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.140
 the hardest part started 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 that is to say the ascent of pandora I 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.240
 absolutely never done 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.950
 we did not say where drive is the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.659
 climb to the top of mont blanc is when 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.659
 even the biggest challenge of the sale 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.360
 Yes 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:46.260

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.360
