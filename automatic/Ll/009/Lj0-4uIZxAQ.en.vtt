the<00:03:48.300> saran<00:03:48.810> wrap<00:03:49.020> didn't<00:03:49.349> work<00:03:49.500> too<00:03:49.709> good

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the saran wrap didn't work too good

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.680 
the saran wrap didn't work too good
because<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.489> too<00:03:50.610> expensive<00:03:50.760> been<00:03:51.330> too<00:03:51.480> hard

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
because it's too expensive been too hard

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.140 
because it's too expensive been too hard
to<00:03:51.840> handle<00:03:52.069> so<00:03:53.069> here's<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.430> idea<00:03:53.849> that<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.090> came

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
to handle so here's the idea that I came

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.660 
to handle so here's the idea that I came
up<00:03:54.360> with<00:03:54.800> go<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.280> some<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.640> this

up with go and get you some of this

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.220 
up with go and get you some of this
right<00:03:57.150> here<00:03:57.330> which<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.540> nothing<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.110> world
