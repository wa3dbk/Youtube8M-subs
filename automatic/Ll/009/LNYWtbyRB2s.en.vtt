00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.259
 julio sand a game we can 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.109
 define the mirror of this season 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.840
 unfortunately not only this but yes 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.240
 This series has a Latin 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.480
 highlighted many of our flaws 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.550
 unfortunately we tried to reopen the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.199
 Latin series having a bit of a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 a bit of luck by winning the tie break 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 tonight we tried but anyway 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.300
 It expressed the desire to Latin America and and I 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 say above all the merit of them why 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 have played three games a more beautiful one 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.980
 of the other and deserved to pass 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.600
 the shift 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 I take this game, it never happened 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.410
 the impression that you could succeed in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.809
 flip the score even from the point 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.840
 of little psychological view when there 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 these benefits come one 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.219
 behind the other, unfortunately, there is no 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 trust lacks self-confidence 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 what you want and unfortunately in this one 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
 Latin series played better deserved 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 You have to go through and just the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.879
 congratulations to them we make a mea culpa 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 ours and nothing is a problem anymore 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.100
 psychological or a personal problem 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 technical but certainly level of 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 attitude helped us a little because 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.040
 however we have entered the field in all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 and three games with an attitude 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
 I think it's wrong because these 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.549
 they started from the outside and you owe them 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.590
 always play to the maximum 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.689
 the attention of the desire of the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.939
 grit and all against teams that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.820
 they play good volleyball and you pay 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.290
 we saw we saw the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.150
 budget is definitely negative of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.460
 this season we saw a lube 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.240
 in these profs really the shadow of that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.410
 that we expected 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.700
 yes unfortunately it was a season 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.890
 full of full of lower ups and downs 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 that high 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.400
 we tried to hide ours 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.120
 defects in the second round because 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.750
 however we came from 10 10 games won 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.850
 after before but anyway not modena 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 certainly the change of has helped us 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.070
 dribbler but these are all a 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.170
 Libyans who unfortunately in our sport 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 of our level do not serve to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 nothing when playing this sport 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.960
 this game is so you have to give 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.350
 always 110 percent are consumed 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350
 no door
