off the top and then that's a white pad
is<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.430> somehow<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.570> LEDs<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.430> inside<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
is this somehow that LEDs are inside it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.700 
is this somehow that LEDs are inside it
somewhere<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:39.210> quite<00:02:39.660> know<00:02:39.870> ice<00:02:40.410> it's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
somewhere I don't quite know ice it's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.070 
somewhere I don't quite know ice it's
magic<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.310> actually<00:02:41.820> magic<00:02:42.150> how<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.390> works

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.580 

we<00:02:46.080> do<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.710> get<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.840> tap<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.290> onto

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
we do you get this do you tap this onto

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.400 
we do you get this do you tap this onto
the<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.390> lift<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.050> bit<00:02:52.230> up

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the back and then you lift this bit up

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.800 
the back and then you lift this bit up
shove<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.240> nice<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
shove it on and then that's it nice and

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.290 
shove it on and then that's it nice and
clipped<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.709> white<00:02:55.890> pad<00:02:56.300> already

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
clipped in so that's a white pad already

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.600 
clipped in so that's a white pad already
with<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.230> light<00:02:58.380> stand<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:59.160> still<00:02:59.370> need<00:02:59.489> to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
with the light stand you still need to

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.560 
with the light stand you still need to
get<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:01.410> bit<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.770> no<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.459> bit<00:03:02.610> loose<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
get this bit on no just bit loose like a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.720
