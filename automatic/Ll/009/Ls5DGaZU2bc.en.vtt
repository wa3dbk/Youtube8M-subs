00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
when Barry told me about this frame I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.850 
when Barry told me about this frame I
thought<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.190> would<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:12.000> potential

thought I would have some potential

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.550 
thought I would have some potential
unfortunately<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.250> disappointed<00:00:15.560> his

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.929 
that's only on late-game infested and
even<00:00:24.480> then<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.050> take<00:00:25.260> him<00:00:25.410> over

to the cryo for a late game build I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.200 
to the cryo for a late game build I
would<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:04.070> strength<00:01:05.070> mods<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.670> duration

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
would just do strength mods and duration

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
would just do strength mods and duration
and<00:01:06.570> since<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.560> affect<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:08.010> range<00:01:08.250> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and since it's not affect by range you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.859 
and since it's not affect by range you
can<00:01:08.549> throw<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> narrow-minded<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.659> worry

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
can throw a narrow-minded and not worry

can throw a narrow-minded and not worry
as<00:01:10.490> for<00:01:11.490> actual<00:01:12.270> fun<00:01:13.110> gameplay<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.710> kind<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
as for actual fun gameplay is kind of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
as for actual fun gameplay is kind of
fun<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> play<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.020> feel

overpowered<00:01:16.860> while<00:01:17.310> playing<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.710> probably

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
overpowered while playing it I probably

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.120 
overpowered while playing it I probably
plays<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.369> over<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.670> frame<00:01:20.970> but

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
plays that for over this frame but

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.670 
plays that for over this frame but
tempest<00:01:23.130> barrage<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:24.540> causes<00:01:24.960> blast<00:01:25.320> damage

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
tempest barrage it causes blast damage

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
tempest barrage it causes blast damage
and<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.009> believe<00:01:26.610> each<00:01:26.820> shell<00:01:27.150> causes<00:01:28.110> the

and I believe each shell causes the
blast<00:01:28.409> effect<00:01:28.770> even<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> doesn't<00:01:29.490> proc

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
blast effect even if it doesn't proc
