notice<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:22.340> also<00:02:23.470> crickets<00:02:24.470> LTE<00:02:24.799> bands<00:02:25.160> are

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
notice now also crickets LTE bands are

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.479 
notice now also crickets LTE bands are
different<00:02:25.910> than<00:02:26.180> verizon<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.230> 18t<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:27.980> believe

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
different than verizon and 18t I believe

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.759 
different than verizon and 18t I believe
I<00:02:28.670> think<00:02:28.880> they<00:02:29.030> will<00:02:29.720> share<00:02:30.080> similar<00:02:30.560> bands

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
I think they will share similar bands

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.120 
I think they will share similar bands
with<00:02:30.980> metropcs<00:02:31.790> US<00:02:32.720> cellular<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.890> course
