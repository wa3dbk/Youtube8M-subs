six months about my 30 watt LED moving
heads<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.049> got<00:00:07.200> from<00:00:07.290> China<00:00:07.589> as<00:00:08.130> far<00:00:08.429> as

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
heads that I got from China as far as

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730 
heads that I got from China as far as
the<00:00:08.940> gobos<00:00:09.510> can<00:00:09.840> change<00:00:10.200> them<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.559> things

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the gobos can change them and things

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740 
the gobos can change them and things
like<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.920> I've<00:00:11.519> opened<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.940> light<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.300> both

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
like that I've opened this light up both

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.259 
like that I've opened this light up both
lights<00:00:12.990> when<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> first<00:00:13.590> got<00:00:13.799> him<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.849> see

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
lights when I first got him just to see

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.400 
lights when I first got him just to see
how<00:00:15.360> cleaning<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.900> inside<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
how cleaning on the inside but I

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.050 
how cleaning on the inside but I
couldn't<00:00:16.710> remember<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.340> they<00:00:17.520> had<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.880> far

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
couldn't remember what they had as far

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.640 
couldn't remember what they had as far
as<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.390> change<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> gobos<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.560> know

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
as can you change the gobos and I know

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.410 
as can you change the gobos and I know
it's<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:19.980> glass<00:00:20.189> gobo<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.670> rest<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.000> metal

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
it's one glass gobo and rest all metal

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
it's one glass gobo and rest all metal
so<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> did<00:00:21.930> finally<00:00:22.260> open<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.560> both<00:00:22.890> flights

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so I did finally open this both flights

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.590 
so I did finally open this both flights
up<00:00:23.310> again<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.970> opening<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.420> on

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
up again I got one opening right here on

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.040 
up again I got one opening right here on
my<00:00:24.689> desk

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
my desk

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
my desk
and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.220> gotta<00:00:26.400> say<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.760> working<00:00:27.029> on

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and I just gotta say from working on

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.480 
and I just gotta say from working on
electronics<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.199> almost<00:00:28.439> 20<00:00:28.830> years<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
electronics for almost 20 years now and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
electronics for almost 20 years now and
then<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> says<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.689> age<00:00:30.840> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
then that says a lot about my age but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.840 
then that says a lot about my age but
I've<00:00:31.500> been<00:00:31.650> doing<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.009> electronic<00:00:32.579> repair

work what goes in comes on this stuff is
this<00:00:42.149> light<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> built<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:43.290> good<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.710> far

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this light is built pretty good as far

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
this light is built pretty good as far
as<00:00:43.950> looking<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> quality<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.000> electronic

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

as looking at the quality of electronic
circuits<00:00:45.930> inside<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.410> now<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> lot

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
circuits inside here now I know a lot

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
circuits inside here now I know a lot
about<00:00:47.300> capacitors<00:00:48.300> transistors<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> all

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that regulators stuff that a lot of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
that regulators stuff that a lot of
people<00:00:52.020> might<00:00:52.170> say<00:00:52.199> yeah<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> light<00:00:52.800> has<00:00:52.980> good

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
people might say yeah the light has good

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
people might say yeah the light has good
power<00:00:53.309> supplies<00:00:53.699> internet<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.329> whatever<00:00:54.510> what

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
power supplies internet or whatever what

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.660 
power supplies internet or whatever what
do<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> actually<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> components

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
do you actually know what the components

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.770 
do you actually know what the components
aren't<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> power<00:00:57.120> supply<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.570> probably

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
aren't a power supply they probably

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.090 
aren't a power supply they probably
don't<00:00:58.020> unless<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> work<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
don't unless you work on that kind of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
don't unless you work on that kind of
stuff<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> use<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> Silla<00:00:59.910> scopes<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
stuff and use the Silla scopes to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.389 
stuff and use the Silla scopes to
measure<00:01:00.629> everything<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> fans<00:01:01.949> cost

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
measure everything but the fans cost

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
measure everything but the fans cost
every<00:01:02.789> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> cool<00:01:03.239> offend<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.809> out

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
every kind of cool offend you see out

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
every kind of cool offend you see out
there<00:01:04.049> has<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> label<00:01:04.470> made<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.920> China<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.760> um

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
there has a label made in China but um

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840 
there has a label made in China but um
yet<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.110> three<00:01:07.380> cooling<00:01:07.680> fans<00:01:07.950> I'll

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
yet this one has three cooling fans I'll

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.340 
yet this one has three cooling fans I'll
just<00:01:09.390> show<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> everything<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.049> far<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
just show you everything as far as the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.539 
just show you everything as far as the
stepper<00:01:10.590> motors<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.490> stuff

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
stepper motors and how all that stuff

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.969 
stepper motors and how all that stuff
works<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.659> removes<00:01:13.110> light<00:01:13.320> around<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
works so removes light around see if you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.600 
works so removes light around see if you
could<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:14.970> better<00:01:16.460> I'm<00:01:17.460> gonna

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
could see a little bit better I'm gonna

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.830 
could see a little bit better I'm gonna
start<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.119> topper<00:01:18.330> light<00:01:18.630> right

that camera focus and on each gobo with
some<00:02:35.590> screws<00:02:35.890> right<00:02:36.070> here<00:02:36.100> like<00:02:36.580> three<00:02:36.850> small

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
some screws right here like three small

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.360 
some screws right here like three small
Phillips<00:02:37.480> heads<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.960> as<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.980> spin<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> wheel

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
Phillips heads and as you spin the wheel

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.580 
Phillips heads and as you spin the wheel
every<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.330> gobos<00:02:40.660> turn<00:02:40.990> themselves

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.660 

that's<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.740> glass<00:02:44.980> one<00:02:45.220> right<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.550> that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
that's the glass one right here that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.650 
that's the glass one right here that
comes<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.330> opening<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.570> to

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
comes with it and opening you got to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.860 
comes with it and opening you got to
like<00:02:49.810> some<00:02:49.990> circles<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:51.190> plus<00:02:51.640> sign<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.300> this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
like some circles a plus sign and this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.530 
like some circles a plus sign and this
other<00:02:53.110> side<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.190> here

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.820 

if<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.660> try<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.900> turn<00:02:59.110> this<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.380> one<00:02:59.500> hand<00:02:59.530> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
if I try to turn this with one hand and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.910 
if I try to turn this with one hand and
hold<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.040> camera<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.460> other<00:03:01.800> see<00:03:02.800> how

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
hold the camera with the other see how

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.800 
hold the camera with the other see how
the<00:03:02.980> Global's<00:03:03.670> actually<00:03:04.000> spin<00:03:04.300> as<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.510> turn

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
the Global's actually spin as you turn

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.010 
the Global's actually spin as you turn
the<00:03:04.990> wheel<00:03:05.110> itself<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.630> I'm<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.840> actually

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
the wheel itself so I'm not actually

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.480 
the wheel itself so I'm not actually
sure<00:03:08.170> if<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.680> change<00:03:08.890> them<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.250> might

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
sure if you can change them you might

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.330 
sure if you can change them you might
but<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.940> might<00:03:10.060> be<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.210> little<00:03:10.330> difficult<00:03:10.930> but

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
but it might be a little difficult but

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.440 
but it might be a little difficult but
I'm<00:03:12.340> not<00:03:12.460> gonna<00:03:12.580> try<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.820> take<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.120> all<00:03:13.210> apart

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
I'm not gonna try to take it all apart

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.190 
I'm not gonna try to take it all apart
right<00:03:13.630> now<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.690> other<00:03:16.840> side<00:03:17.050> over

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
right now and on the other side over

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.850 
right now and on the other side over
here<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.860> color<00:03:18.310> wheel<00:03:19.380> see<00:03:20.380> I<00:03:20.440> can

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
here we have the color wheel see I can

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.020 
here we have the color wheel see I can
spin<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.310> my<00:03:21.400> hand<00:03:21.610> right<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:21.760> see

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
spin this with my hand right here see

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.750 
spin this with my hand right here see
how<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.180> colors<00:03:22.510> change<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.370> get<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.580> better

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
how the colors change so I get a better

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.000 
how the colors change so I get a better
shot<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.300> now<00:03:28.989> here's<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.260> better<00:03:29.410> shot<00:03:29.500> yeah

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
shot of it now here's a better shot yeah

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.710 
shot of it now here's a better shot yeah
his<00:03:30.190> actual<00:03:30.610> glass<00:03:31.180> color<00:03:31.480> wheel<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:34.360> spins

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
his actual glass color wheel it spins

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.890 
his actual glass color wheel it spins
around<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.090> more<00:03:37.239> belts<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.690> here

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
around and you get more belts up here

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.110 
for almost a year straight or his
abettors<00:03:52.750> look<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.200> actual<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.880> stepper

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
abettors look at the actual the stepper

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.430 
abettors look at the actual the stepper
motor<00:03:55.239> how<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.570> operates<00:03:55.989> right<00:03:56.080> here<00:03:56.140> this<00:03:56.380> is

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
motor how it operates right here this is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.830 
motor how it operates right here this is
actual<00:03:56.950> device<00:03:57.370> right<00:03:57.580> here<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.880> see<00:03:58.600> right

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
actual device right here to see right

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.600 
actual device right here to see right
here<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.230> circuit<00:03:59.650> sends<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.100> voltage<00:04:00.430> in

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
here the circuit sends the voltage in

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.820 
here the circuit sends the voltage in
right<00:04:00.820> here<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:01.989> get<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.170> voltage<00:04:02.350> and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
right here and you get a voltage and

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.220 
right here and you get a voltage and
then<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.100> got<00:04:03.250> signal<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.180> signal<00:04:04.540> out<00:04:04.690> that

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
then you got signal in signal out that

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.870 
then you got signal in signal out that
does<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.530> puts<00:04:05.860> infrared<00:04:06.280> signal<00:04:06.670> across

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
does this puts infrared signal across

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.370 
does this puts infrared signal across
all<00:04:07.360> across<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.050> whole<00:04:08.200> top<00:04:08.230> right<00:04:08.590> here<00:04:10.380> I'm

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
all across the whole top right here I'm

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.900 
all across the whole top right here I'm
getting<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.709> little<00:04:11.800> bit<00:04:12.010> techy<00:04:12.400> for<00:04:12.670> some<00:04:12.820> of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
getting a little bit techy for some of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.710 
getting a little bit techy for some of
you<00:04:12.970> guys<00:04:13.120> but<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.110> get<00:04:14.260> two<00:04:14.860> sides<00:04:15.720> like

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
you guys but so you get two sides like

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.960 
you guys but so you get two sides like
in<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.830> right<00:04:18.220> here<00:04:18.370> these<00:04:18.519> two<00:04:18.580> sides

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
in and out right here these two sides

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.909 
in and out right here these two sides
beam<00:04:19.690> has<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.049> cross<00:04:20.290> all<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.560> way<00:04:20.709> through

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
beam has to cross all the way through

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.390 
beam has to cross all the way through
here<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.280> as<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.789> goes<00:04:22.090> through<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:24.190> holes

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
here and as it goes through the holes

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.220 
here and as it goes through the holes
right<00:04:24.610> here

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
right here

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.210 
right here
that's<00:04:27.230> how<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.410> knows<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.770> beam<00:04:27.920> goes

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
that's how it knows the beam goes

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.370 
that's how it knows the beam goes
through<00:04:28.490> beam<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.300> blocked<00:04:29.600> beam<00:04:30.140> goes

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
through beam is blocked beam goes

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.500 
through beam is blocked beam goes
through<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.130> every<00:04:31.400> little<00:04:31.550> section<00:04:32.480> right

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
through so every little section right

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.360 
through so every little section right
here<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.720> blocked<00:04:33.170> that's<00:04:33.680> how<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:33.950> counts

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
here is blocked that's how it counts

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.710 
here is blocked that's how it counts
that's<00:04:34.670> how<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.850> stepper<00:04:35.120> motors<00:04:35.450> actually

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
that's how the stepper motors actually

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.340 
that's how the stepper motors actually
operate<00:04:37.240> now<00:04:38.240> as<00:04:38.450> far<00:04:38.600> as<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.780> bottom<00:04:39.110> this

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
operate now as far as the bottom this

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.020 
operate now as far as the bottom this
light<00:04:39.560> has<00:04:39.710> two<00:04:39.920> power<00:04:40.100> supplies<00:04:40.310> in<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.790> looks

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
light has two power supplies in it looks

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.150 
light has two power supplies in it looks
like<00:04:41.180> pretty<00:04:41.360> good<00:04:41.600> power<00:04:41.750> supplies<00:04:42.110> too<00:04:42.380> of

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
like pretty good power supplies too of

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.410 
like pretty good power supplies too of
course<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.550> see<00:04:43.700> right<00:04:43.880> here<00:04:44.000> for<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> pan

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
course you see right here for the pan

course you see right here for the pan
here's<00:04:44.720> another<00:04:44.930> section<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.860> a<00:04:45.890> motor

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
here's another section with a motor

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.040 
here's another section with a motor
right<00:04:46.190> here<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.520> counts<00:04:46.970> all<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.390> open

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
right here that counts all the open

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.420 
right here that counts all the open
slots<00:04:48.350> where<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.650> knows<00:04:48.800> positions<00:04:49.340> and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
slots where it knows positions and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.950 
slots where it knows positions and
everything<00:04:49.760> we<00:04:50.150> built<00:04:50.420> all<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.720> kind<00:04:50.930> of

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
everything we built all this kind of

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.390 
everything we built all this kind of
stuff<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.230> electronics<00:04:51.740> class<00:04:51.950> and<00:04:52.160> we<00:04:52.220> did

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
stuff in electronics class and we did

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.950 
stuff in electronics class and we did
all<00:04:52.490> kind<00:04:52.670> of<00:04:52.700> troubleshooting<00:04:53.030> with<00:04:53.450> lab<00:04:53.660> and

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
all kind of troubleshooting with lab and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.210 
all kind of troubleshooting with lab and
everything<00:04:54.230> back<00:04:54.410> that's<00:04:54.650> way<00:04:54.770> back<00:04:54.950> in<00:04:55.100> high

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
everything back that's way back in high

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.160 
everything back that's way back in high
school<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.670> college<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.630> we<00:04:56.750> know<00:04:56.900> everything

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
school and college so we know everything

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.840 
school and college so we know everything
how<00:04:57.530> they<00:04:57.710> operate<00:04:58.100> how<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.250> count<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.610> ones

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
how they operate how to count to ones

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.510 
how they operate how to count to ones
and<00:04:58.940> zeros<00:04:59.360> but<00:05:00.050> enough<00:05:00.470> for<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.710> cooling

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
and zeros but enough for that cooling

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.450 
and zeros but enough for that cooling

pretty<00:05:07.520> good<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:07.790> got<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.000> step<00:05:08.180> down

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
pretty good you got to step down

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.240 
pretty good you got to step down
transform<00:05:08.870> with<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.080> steps<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.440> now<00:05:09.530> for<00:05:09.590> 120

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
transform with that steps in now for 120

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.230 
transform with that steps in now for 120
to<00:05:10.340> about<00:05:10.460> 12<00:05:10.730> volts

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
to about 12 volts

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.300 
to about 12 volts
you<00:05:11.720> got<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:12.080> filter<00:05:12.380> capacitor<00:05:12.980> right<00:05:13.130> here

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
you got a filter capacitor right here

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.810 
you got a filter capacitor right here
that<00:05:13.460> filters<00:05:13.850> out<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.980> pure<00:05:15.980> DC<00:05:16.190> zap<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.670> AC

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
that filters out the pure DC zap the AC

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.460 
that filters out the pure DC zap the AC
comes<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.390> it's<00:05:17.570> got<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.690> great<00:05:17.900> converting<00:05:18.380> but

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
comes in it's got a great converting but

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.510 
comes in it's got a great converting but
this<00:05:18.620> little<00:05:18.770> device<00:05:18.920> right<00:05:19.220> here<00:05:19.280> it's

AC<00:05:22.070> over<00:05:22.670> to<00:05:22.790> DC<00:05:23.210> then<00:05:23.810> after<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.440> got<00:05:24.590> to

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
AC over to DC then after that you got to

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.990 
AC over to DC then after that you got to
go<00:05:24.770> to<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:24.920> filter<00:05:25.160> circuit<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:25.610> tries<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.790> give

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
which is pretty good I mean because a

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.510 
which is pretty good I mean because a
lot<00:05:59.990> of<00:06:00.020> these<00:06:00.110> chips<00:06:00.710> do<00:06:00.890> get<00:06:01.100> warm<00:06:01.310> when<00:06:01.460> they

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
lot of these chips do get warm when they

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.860 
lot of these chips do get warm when they
start<00:06:01.760> processing<00:06:02.240> information<00:06:02.390> but<00:06:02.750> they've

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
start processing information but they've

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.690 
start processing information but they've
actually<00:06:03.080> put<00:06:03.380> cooling<00:06:04.130> fins<00:06:04.340> on<00:06:04.520> there

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
actually put cooling fins on there

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.790 
actually put cooling fins on there
everything<00:06:05.060> in<00:06:05.210> here<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:06.500> that's<00:06:06.650> pretty

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
everything in here so that's pretty

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.110 
everything in here so that's pretty
