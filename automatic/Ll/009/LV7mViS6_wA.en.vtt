00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.230
No!?

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.462
(Alistor coughs)

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:37.428
Aaarrgh!

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:39.091
No!!!

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:10.962
Alistor..?

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.687
I.. feel.. bloody awful!

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:13.562
Shh!

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:14.852
Just lie still..

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:20.044
I'll see.. see you..

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:21.961
Alistor, hold on!

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.407
I'll see you.. in..

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:27.577
Avalon..

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.573
(Lara sighs)

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.420
Damnit!

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.456
(Winston exclaims)

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:02.184
No?

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:10.316
What the hell was that thing!?

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:14.494
I've only seen something like it once before..

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.430
A doppelganger that Natla sent after me years ago..

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.472
That one didn't have a mind of it's own..?

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:25.898
But how could Natla have sent it if she's Amanda's prisoner?

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.121
They're a team of sorts now, 

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.146
Amanda and Natla,

00:02:29.276 --> 00:02:32.116
Her pet Atlantian God(!)

00:02:33.032 --> 00:02:34.272
What are we going to do!?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.410
After I deal with the authorities,

00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.484
I'm going to Southern Mexico to retrieve Thor's Belt.

00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:41.571
What!?

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:42.941
Alistor's dead and..

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.399
..and's it's just business as usual!?

00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:49.471
I need Thor's Belt to get his Hammer.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.501
And I need the Hammer to kill a God!

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:57.147
(Fire Sirens Approach)
