00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
with I've got on cats couple times so I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
with I've got on cats couple times so I
have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.399> general<00:00:59.850> idea<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:01.020> their

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
have a general idea on what their

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
have a general idea on what their
Anatomy<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> start

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
Anatomy is like so I'm going to start

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.270 
Anatomy is like so I'm going to start
with<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> circle<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.470> building<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.949> shapes

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
with a circle I like building my shapes

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
with a circle I like building my shapes
up<00:01:05.519> rather<00:01:05.850> than<00:01:06.210> trying<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.780> draw<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
up rather than trying to draw the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.340 
up rather than trying to draw the
outline<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> start<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
outline so we're going to start with a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
outline so we're going to start with a
circle<00:01:10.619> at<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> head<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
circle at the head and then kind of a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.109 
circle at the head and then kind of a
cone<00:01:12.810> shape<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> neck<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:18.090> a

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
cone shape here for the neck and then a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
cone shape here for the neck and then a
little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> triangle<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
little bit of a triangle for the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.999 
little bit of a triangle for the
shoulder<00:01:20.670> blade<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:22.380> rectangle

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
shoulder blade and a rectangle

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
shoulder blade and a rectangle
definition<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.970> sort<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> another

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
definition out and sort of another

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190 
definition out and sort of another
rectangle<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> chest<00:01:27.140> I'm<00:01:28.140> going

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
rectangle there for the chest I'm going

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
rectangle there for the chest I'm going
to<00:01:28.320> draw<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> line<00:01:28.909> here<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.210> represent<00:01:30.509> its

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to draw a line here to represent its

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.630 
to draw a line here to represent its
back<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:32.270> lot<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> times<00:01:33.420> I'll<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:34.140> lines

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
back a lot of times I'll just use lines

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.130 
back a lot of times I'll just use lines
to<00:01:35.640> start<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.210> sketch<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.840> give<00:01:36.930> me<00:01:37.049> an

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to start out my sketch to give me an

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.999 
to start out my sketch to give me an
idea<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.979> pose<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.549> want

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
idea of the pose I want

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.889 
idea of the pose I want
let's<00:01:41.009> draw<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.400> lines<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> feet

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
let's draw some lines here for the feet

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.770 
let's draw some lines here for the feet
too<00:01:43.520> now<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.729> original<00:01:45.119> sketch<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.659> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
too now my original sketch I think it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
too now my original sketch I think it's
haunches<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> little<00:01:46.710> too<00:01:46.799> high<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.220> I'm

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
haunches got a little too high so I'm

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700 
haunches got a little too high so I'm
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> lower<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to lower that a little bit and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.240 
going to lower that a little bit and
also<00:01:49.829> bring<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:52.250> draw

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
also bring it back here so just draw

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
also bring it back here so just draw
squares<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.299> an<00:01:54.390> idea<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> where<00:01:55.079> all

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
squares here to get an idea of where all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.630 
squares here to get an idea of where all
the<00:01:55.890> body<00:01:56.070> shapes<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.369> have

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the body shapes are now you don't have

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
the body shapes are now you don't have
to<00:01:59.700> do<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.680> way

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to do it this way I just this is the way

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.370 
to do it this way I just this is the way
I<00:02:02.040> feel<00:02:02.100> most<00:02:02.640> comfortable<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.630> find

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
I feel most comfortable and I I find

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.869 
I feel most comfortable and I I find
it's<00:02:04.560> easier<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.579> draw<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.030> way<00:02:07.759> there's<00:02:08.759> not

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
it's easier to draw this way there's not

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.880 
it's easier to draw this way there's not
really<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.179> wrong<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> draw<00:02:09.929> I'm<00:02:10.709> also

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
really a wrong way to draw I'm also

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
really a wrong way to draw I'm also
using<00:02:11.069> paint<00:02:12.030> tool<00:02:12.209> Sai<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.720> today

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
using paint tool Sai here today

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.770 
using paint tool Sai here today
I<00:02:13.470> find<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.400> great<00:02:14.640> program<00:02:15.270> it's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I find it's a really great program it's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.080 
I find it's a really great program it's
fairly<00:02:16.080> inexpensive<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.820> got<00:02:17.940> some

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
fairly inexpensive and it's got some

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.890 
fairly inexpensive and it's got some
great<00:02:18.330> tools<00:02:18.650> when<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.770> comes<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.160> sketching

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
great tools when it comes to sketching

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.020 
great tools when it comes to sketching
and<00:02:21.900> draw<00:02:22.110> triangle<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.130> like<00:02:23.700> drawing<00:02:23.880> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and draw triangle here I like drawing a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.280 
and draw triangle here I like drawing a
triangle<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:26.420> figure<00:02:27.420> out<00:02:27.600> where<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.960> want<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
triangle to figure out where I want the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.750 
triangle to figure out where I want the
face<00:02:28.530> facing<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> change

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
face facing and if you have to change

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.190 
face facing and if you have to change
things<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.330> you're<00:02:33.480> sketching<00:02:33.690> along<00:02:33.990> that's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
things as you're sketching along that's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.870 
things as you're sketching along that's
totally<00:02:34.590> okay<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.130> doesn't<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.550> be<00:02:35.640> first

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
totally okay it doesn't have to be first

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.130 
totally okay it doesn't have to be first
perfect<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.050> first<00:02:37.200> time<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.840> draw<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
perfect the first time out and draw a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.660 
perfect the first time out and draw a
little<00:02:40.230> bit<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> square<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.370> represent

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
little bit of a square here to represent

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
little bit of a square here to represent
the<00:02:42.030> muzzle<00:02:42.420> cats<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.050> fairly<00:02:43.260> short

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the muzzle cats have fairly short

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.540 
the muzzle cats have fairly short
muzzles<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:46.020> they<00:02:46.140> need<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> be<00:02:46.500> real<00:02:46.710> big<00:02:46.920> now

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
muzzles so they need to be real big now

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.330 
muzzles so they need to be real big now
so<00:02:47.760> kind<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.300> triangular<00:02:48.930> or<00:02:49.740> oval

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so kind of have triangular or oval

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.100 
so kind of have triangular or oval
shaped<00:02:50.700> faces<00:02:50.970> depending<00:02:51.480> upon<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.780> breed<00:02:51.990> of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
shaped faces depending upon the breed of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.870 
shaped faces depending upon the breed of
course<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.160> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> be<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> normal

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
course this is just going to be a normal

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.440 
course this is just going to be a normal

domestic Shorthair right now that I've
got<00:02:57.660> my<00:02:57.690> first<00:02:58.110> sketch<00:02:59.450> I'm<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.320> lower

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
got my first sketch I'm going to lower

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
got my first sketch I'm going to lower
the<00:03:01.710> opacity<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:04.070> really<00:03:05.070> faint<00:03:05.310> if

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
the opacity and make it really faint if

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.160 
the opacity and make it really faint if
you're<00:03:05.700> using<00:03:05.880> piece<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.360> paper<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.020> can

you're using piece of paper as you can

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.560 
you're using piece of paper as you can
surely<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:08.430> know<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.330> use<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
surely you know you have to use a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.510 
surely you know you have to use a
digital<00:03:11.510> program<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.780> your<00:03:12.930> sketching<00:03:13.320> I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
digital program to do your sketching I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.680 
digital program to do your sketching I
just<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.240> because<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> makes<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
just I like it because it makes it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.190 
just I like it because it makes it
easier<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.400> for<00:03:17.400> doing<00:03:18.210> tutorials<00:03:18.630> it's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
easier and for doing tutorials it's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.640 
easier and for doing tutorials it's
definitely<00:03:19.680> helpful<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.510> again<00:03:22.290> I'm<00:03:22.530> just

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
definitely helpful and again I'm just

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.770 
definitely helpful and again I'm just
kind<00:03:22.740> of<00:03:22.950> filling<00:03:23.400> out<00:03:24.350> some<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.040> shapes

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
kind of filling out some of the shapes

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.640 
kind of filling out some of the shapes
making<00:03:27.780> them<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.110> little<00:03:28.260> bit<00:03:28.440> more<00:03:28.590> concrete

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
making them a little bit more concrete

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I'm not going to draw in the fur because

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
get the idea in the shape and then you

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.580 
get the idea in the shape and then you
don't<00:03:49.709> do<00:03:49.860> more<00:03:50.040> details<00:03:50.550> as<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.970> go<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.590> and

bigger<00:04:12.420> noses<00:04:12.959> or<00:04:13.140> smaller<00:04:13.470> than<00:04:13.740> others<00:04:14.040> or

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
bigger noses or smaller than others or

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.870 
bigger noses or smaller than others or
flatter<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:16.799> definitely<00:04:17.190> something<00:04:17.760> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
flatter so it's definitely something to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
flatter so it's definitely something to
consider<00:04:18.000> when<00:04:18.510> you're<00:04:18.690> drawing<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.260> what

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
consider when you're drawing is what

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.640 
consider when you're drawing is what
kind<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.650> what<00:04:20.220> type<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.489> cat<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:20.910> wanna<00:04:21.120> draw

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
kind of what type of cat you wanna draw

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.120 
kind of what type of cat you wanna draw
and<00:04:22.650> they<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.610> pretty<00:04:24.120> narrow<00:04:24.990> chins<00:04:25.979> they

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
and they have pretty narrow chins they

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.930 
and they have pretty narrow chins they
don't<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.370> have<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> whole

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
don't really have a whole

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.340 
don't really have a whole
chin<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.690> one's<00:04:27.930> going<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.110> be<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> little

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
chin so this one's going to be a little

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.420 
chin so this one's going to be a little
bit<00:04:28.470> too<00:04:28.620> near<00:04:28.830> than<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:30.030> realistic-looking

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.340 

that's<00:04:35.430> good<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.690> again<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.080> know<00:04:37.170> if<00:04:37.230> it's

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
that's good and again you know if it's

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.540 
that's good and again you know if it's
not<00:04:37.470> perfect<00:04:37.800> that's<00:04:37.860> okay<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.370> always

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
not perfect that's okay you can always

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.580 
not perfect that's okay you can always
go<00:04:38.700> back<00:04:38.850> over<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:40.970> revise<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.240> some<00:04:42.480> and<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
go back over and revise it some and you

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.840 
go back over and revise it some and you
want<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> make<00:04:43.890> sure<00:04:43.920> that<00:04:44.190> ears<00:04:44.430> are<00:04:44.640> kind<00:04:44.730> of

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
want to make sure that ears are kind of

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.340 
want to make sure that ears are kind of
rounded<00:04:45.210> at<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.330> top<00:04:45.450> they're<00:04:45.840> not<00:04:45.990> they

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
rounded at the top they're not they

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.900 
rounded at the top they're not they
don't<00:04:46.500> come<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.770> like<00:04:46.890> really<00:04:47.220> hard<00:04:47.430> points

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
don't come to like really hard points

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.850 
don't come to like really hard points
unless<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.840> course<00:04:48.900> there's<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.560> little

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
unless of course there's like a little

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.760 
unless of course there's like a little
spike<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.310> fluff<00:04:51.230> something<00:04:52.230> else<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.500> keep<00:04:52.620> in

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
spike of fluff something else to keep in

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.310 
spike of fluff something else to keep in
mind<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.670> know<00:04:53.790> there<00:04:54.000> will<00:04:54.960> keep<00:04:55.170> your

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
mind is you know there will keep your

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.730 
mind is you know there will keep your
lines<00:04:55.560> nice<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> fluid<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:57.470> cats<00:04:58.470> are<00:04:58.620> kind

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
lines nice and fluid and cats are kind

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.490 
lines nice and fluid and cats are kind
of<00:04:58.920> their<00:04:59.400> skin<00:04:59.700> is<00:04:59.880> kind<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.120> floppy<00:05:00.500> very

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
of their skin is kind of floppy very

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.020 
of their skin is kind of floppy very
elastic<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.280> that's<00:05:02.460> something<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.790> keep<00:05:02.940> in

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
elastic so that's something to keep in

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.350 
elastic so that's something to keep in
mind<00:05:03.090> when<00:05:03.420> you're<00:05:03.570> sketching<00:05:05.120> I'm<00:05:06.120> going<00:05:06.300> to

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
mind when you're sketching I'm going to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.790 
mind when you're sketching I'm going to
lower<00:05:06.510> this<00:05:06.720> line<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:06.990> little<00:05:07.140> bit<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.590> think

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
lower this line a little bit I think

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.260 
lower this line a little bit I think
that<00:05:07.920> got<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.100> little<00:05:08.370> too<00:05:08.550> high<00:05:08.730> along<00:05:09.090> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
that got a little too high along the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.940 
that got a little too high along the
shoulder<00:05:10.340> I'm<00:05:11.340> gonna<00:05:11.640> zoom<00:05:12.060> out<00:05:12.240> some<00:05:12.510> more<00:05:12.950> if

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
shoulder I'm gonna zoom out some more if

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.410 
shoulder I'm gonna zoom out some more if
the<00:05:14.070> head<00:05:14.220> got<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> little<00:05:14.640> bit<00:05:14.730> big<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.270> what

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
the head got a little bit big so what

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.530 
the head got a little bit big so what
I'm<00:05:15.510> going<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.690> do<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:16.910> lasso<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:20.390> make<00:05:21.390> it

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
I'm going to do is lasso it and make it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.410 
I'm going to do is lasso it and make it
a<00:05:21.600> little<00:05:21.690> bit<00:05:21.840> smaller<00:05:22.970> just<00:05:23.970> add<00:05:24.240> that's

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
a little bit smaller just add that's

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.730 
a little bit smaller just add that's
another<00:05:24.630> reason<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.170> like<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.380> sketch

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
another reason I like to sketch

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.680 
another reason I like to sketch
digitally<00:05:26.280> because<00:05:26.370> it's<00:05:26.640> it's<00:05:27.240> easier<00:05:27.540> to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
digitally because it's it's easier to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.010 
digitally because it's it's easier to
make<00:05:27.840> changes<00:05:29.510> instead<00:05:30.510> of<00:05:30.570> having<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.870> race

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
make changes instead of having to race

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.300 
make changes instead of having to race
the<00:05:31.140> whole<00:05:31.290> thing<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.680> start<00:05:31.740> over<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:34.310> a

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
the whole thing and start over and a

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.550 
the whole thing and start over and a
little<00:05:35.760> bit<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.030> rough<00:05:36.240> there<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:36.930> I'm<00:05:37.320> going

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
little bit of rough there and I'm going

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.320 
little bit of rough there and I'm going
to<00:05:37.620> lower<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.220> down<00:05:38.610> some<00:05:38.940> because<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.210> think

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
to lower that down some because I think

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.520 
to lower that down some because I think
that's<00:05:39.480> still<00:05:39.660> too<00:05:39.900> high<00:05:41.690> here<00:05:42.690> we<00:05:42.810> go<00:05:45.530> and

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
that's still too high here we go and

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.940 
that's still too high here we go and
then<00:05:46.770> add<00:05:47.070> in<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:48.210> lines<00:05:48.450> for<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.870> leg<00:05:49.140> when

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
then add in the lines for the leg when

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.900 
then add in the lines for the leg when
they<00:05:50.070> have<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.220> little<00:05:50.400> bit<00:05:50.550> of<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:51.020> risk<00:05:52.020> there

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
they have a little bit of a risk there

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.290 
they have a little bit of a risk there
drawing<00:05:53.910> pause<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.919> remember<00:05:56.730> cats<00:05:57.090> don't

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
drawing pause and remember cats don't

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.290 
drawing pause and remember cats don't
have<00:05:57.450> their<00:05:57.720> claws<00:05:57.930> out<00:05:58.140> generally<00:05:58.620> they<00:05:59.300> they

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
have their claws out generally they they

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.750 
have their claws out generally they they
bring<00:06:00.570> them<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.900> their<00:06:01.050> toes<00:06:01.760> but

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
bring them in to their toes but

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.290 
bring them in to their toes but
sometimes<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.210> do<00:06:03.330> see<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.660> little<00:06:03.930> line<00:06:04.110> for

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
sometimes you do see the little line for

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.880 
sometimes you do see the little line for
where<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.480> claws<00:06:07.169> come<00:06:07.440> out<00:06:07.530> so<00:06:07.710> you<00:06:07.770> can

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
where the claws come out so you can

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.620 
where the claws come out so you can
stick<00:06:08.100> that<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.370> there<00:06:08.520> want<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:09.150> little<00:06:09.480> bit<00:06:09.570> of

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
stick that in there want a little bit of

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.830 
stick that in there want a little bit of
a<00:06:09.750> do<00:06:09.870> pop<00:06:10.400> it's<00:06:11.400> kind<00:06:11.669> of<00:06:11.700> their<00:06:11.850> thumb<00:06:12.060> this

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
a do pop it's kind of their thumb this

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.510 
a do pop it's kind of their thumb this
is<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:12.990> nice<00:06:13.169> fat<00:06:13.500> cat<00:06:13.770> so<00:06:14.010> we're<00:06:14.100> going<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.310> a

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520
