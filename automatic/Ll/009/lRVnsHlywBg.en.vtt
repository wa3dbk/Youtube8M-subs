00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.020
 all right 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.719
 hi everyone live in that channel 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.969
 girls labels today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.550
 to do this hairstyle is a wave like this 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.040
 Mermaid waves like a wave in water 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.110
 but more disheveled is very easy 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.550
 get this wave so I remind you 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.269
 the video and so we see it 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.269
 do not 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.690
 well we have straight hair and we are going to 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.990
 make the corkscrew to make 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.850
 I'm going to use the coriolis cone and what 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.820
 what I'm going to do is we're going to do 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.730
 out all the curls 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 and once you have them, they are not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.650
 hot then those of spain we will do so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.290
 that this side we will do everything towards 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.210
 outside and this side we will do everything towards 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.890
 forum we see a rubber band and let's go 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.980
 doing partitions and let's go 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.980
 leaving loose strands of hair 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.100
 Y 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.519
 we take a puppet up we go or not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.540
 once we have them 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.560
 and let's start doing 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 take a lock 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.750
 what we do is roll up flat on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.000
 hair 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 hurry 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.030
 and if in the root enohsa 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.650
 a little more loose we bring it closer 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.310
 a moment to be hot 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.130
 hair if you want to touch it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.970
 to check and then release them without 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.680
 undo 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.210
 and we let it fall 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.909
 so let's go doing 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 the strands of this side towards the same 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.780
 sense 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.190
 Well, let's take 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.700
 and we roll it 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.700
 on the contrary 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.620
 well what are we going to do now when 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.390
 we have this let's go loosing 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.050
 of the hair we are going to do 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.050
 exactly the same in each match 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.629
 forever 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
 a little bit 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.710
 we can not stand a little 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.580
 and we have one more layer left, this layer 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.780
 that you already have to look more or less 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.850
 where you want to place it and this area of 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.140
 here we go 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 to crystal because I'm going to drop it 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.560
 on this side of here it's worth 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.560
 the country 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.690
 and we were born 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.140
 and well I'm going to make another partition you see 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.200
 that there are some who choose the partitions 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.920
 a little bit diagonally because I want that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.390
 give me a little 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.380
 so here 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.380
 can continue sending 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.490
 is flat 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.490
 a little 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.870
 well once we have done all the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.020
 curls all over the hair as you see 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.090
 search a curl 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.160
 given everything towards liquefied are also left 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.650
 very pretty and electric a little bit of 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.480
 so you could leave and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.480
 luce looks very nice 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.420
 the separated waves but good in this 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.150
 I want to show you a wave 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.360
 different what we would do is with a comb 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.940
 of this type like this 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.120
 what what makes us is to comb 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.370
 superficially to undo the curl 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.890
 above but leaving all the way 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.060
 so what we do I recommend is 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.440
 as of 20 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.470
 Apply a little bit of the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.470
 and let's reign over 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.139
 we have a kind of wave left 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.199
 disheveled that does not become a wave 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.649
 of water but I find it nice 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.300
 It is also very fashionable and well you see 

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:51.610
 I've done a little volume here 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.800
 then what you can do if you do not 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.810
 the wave has just been where you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.760
 you want you can place 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.460
 go placing them where you 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.510
 you are going to like the wave 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.590
 example 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.590
 I want me to stay 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.430
 and yes 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.930
 and here is tiny 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.870
 other 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.920
 a little bit of wave 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.000
 how is it in egypt 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.770
 on 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.539
 on one side you can do here 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.539
 a braid what you 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.500
 Well, you have already seen that it is very 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.990
 easy to get this type of online more 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.330
 if we use the cone anyway 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.070
 would destroy a new video to get 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.650
 the same hairstyle with the irons 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.950
 add me social networks I hope to 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.950
 all 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.599
 comment and participate 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.569
 raffles to leave comments on the 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:11.509
 video on the channel do not forget that
