right<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.829> some<00:01:28.829> kind<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.040> resonator

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
right there that some kind of resonator

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
right there that some kind of resonator
that<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> does

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that I really don't know what it does

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.969 
that I really don't know what it does
but<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.450> know<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> understand<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
but I know from what I understand is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
but I know from what I understand is
nothing<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.540> there's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> filter

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
nothing in it and there's the filter

00:01:37.890 --> 00:02:06.250 
nothing in it and there's the filter
installed<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.759> goes<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.119> front<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.220> cell

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
that's where I pick up the plus side of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.990 
that's where I pick up the plus side of
the<00:04:03.420> battery<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:04.200> used<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.130> do<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.340> at<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
the battery I used to do that at the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.240 
the battery I used to do that at the
battery<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:08.000> found<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.740> arrangement<00:04:10.740> here

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
battery I found this arrangement here

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.780 
battery I found this arrangement here
that<00:04:11.970> actually<00:04:12.800> goes<00:04:13.800> directly<00:04:14.250> into<00:04:14.370> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that actually goes directly into the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.520 
that actually goes directly into the
positive<00:04:15.330> side<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.840> battery<00:04:15.990> that's

positive side of the battery that's

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.300 
positive side of the battery that's
going<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.040> work<00:04:17.190> just<00:04:17.459> fine<00:04:17.790> makes<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.840> cleaner

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
going to work just fine makes a cleaner

negative<00:04:31.520> couple<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.640> things<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.060> have<00:04:33.240> to

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
negative couple of things I have to

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:41.150 
negative couple of things I have to
install<00:04:33.810> here<00:04:38.419> there's<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.740> good<00:04:40.740> picture<00:04:41.130> of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
install here there's a good picture of

install here there's a good picture of
the<00:04:41.340> space<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.850> I'm<00:04:41.970> putting<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.390> cell<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
the space that I'm putting the cell and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.350 
the space that I'm putting the cell and
you<00:04:43.080> can<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.440> shelf<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.700> sits<00:04:45.060> right

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
you can see that shelf that sits right

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.060 
you can see that shelf that sits right
there<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.660> didn't<00:04:46.050> put<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.260> there<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.890> just

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
there I didn't put that there it just

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.100 
there I didn't put that there it just
happens<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.760> be<00:04:47.790> there<00:04:48.180> there's<00:04:48.690> one<00:04:48.960> other

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
i'll probably put some kind of insulator

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.010 
i'll probably put some kind of insulator
there<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.580> keep<00:04:59.729> the<00:04:59.880> vibrations<00:05:00.540> away<00:05:00.810> from
