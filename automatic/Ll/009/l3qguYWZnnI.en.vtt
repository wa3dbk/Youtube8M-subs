00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
this like a regular first look is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.970 
this like a regular first look is
because<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.630> game<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:22.619> only

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
because this game is like only

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.220 
because this game is like only
multiplayer<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.150> can't<00:00:24.449> play<00:00:24.689> against<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
multiplayer you can't play against the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.310 
multiplayer you can't play against the
enemy<00:00:25.680> AI<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.269> far<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.140> my

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
enemy AI and so far from what my

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
enemy AI and so far from what my
experience<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.859> game<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.970> game

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
experience this game i think this game

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.380 
experience this game i think this game
didn't<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.170> job<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.949> there

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
didn't do a very good job in there

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.670 
didn't do a very good job in there
multiplayer<00:00:33.390> aspect<00:00:34.020> i<00:00:34.200> mean<00:00:34.380> because

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
multiplayer aspect i mean because

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.229 
multiplayer aspect i mean because
there's<00:00:34.860> no<00:00:35.010> AI<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> play<00:00:36.090> better

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
there's no AI you have to play better

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
there's no AI you have to play better
players<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.739> made<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
players but they made it so that you

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
players but they made it so that you
don't<00:00:38.700> play<00:00:38.879> against<00:00:39.210> live<00:00:39.510> players<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.440> play

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
don't play against live players you play

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
don't play against live players you play
against<00:00:41.010> other<00:00:41.160> players<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.239> they're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
against other players but then they're

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.660 
against other players but then they're
not<00:00:42.750> technically<00:00:43.530> online<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
not technically online and you have to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
not technically online and you have to
wait<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.210> their<00:00:46.050> turn<00:00:46.079> before<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.579> make

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
wait for their turn before you can make

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
wait for their turn before you can make
another<00:00:48.090> turn<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> those

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
another turn so it's like one of those

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.459 
another turn so it's like one of those
the<00:00:50.430> online<00:00:50.820> games<00:00:51.149> were<00:00:51.390> say<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> make<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the online games were say you make a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
the online games were say you make a
move<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> wait<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.699> your

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
move and then you to wait for your

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
move and then you to wait for your
opponent<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.140> online<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> move

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
opponent to go online and make a move

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.010 
opponent to go online and make a move
and<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.789> day<00:00:56.969> wait<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> go<00:00:57.840> back

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and then day wait for you to go back

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
and then day wait for you to go back
online<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> make<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> move<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.480> my

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
online and make a move so that's my

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
online and make a move so that's my
biggest<00:01:00.840> con<00:01:01.140> right<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.430> can't

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
biggest con right now is that you can't

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
biggest con right now is that you can't
really<00:01:02.699> play<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.120> game<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.199> gotta

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
really play the game because you gotta

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
really play the game because you gotta
wait<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.220> other<00:01:05.580> person's<00:01:06.090> turn<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
wait for the other person's turn but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
wait for the other person's turn but

isn't<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.170> anything<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.829> while<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
isn't really anything to do while you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
isn't really anything to do while you
wait<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.369> other<00:01:42.000> people<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.570> their

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
wait for other people to make their

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469 
wait for other people to make their
turns<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> two-player<00:01:45.329> mode

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
turns they do have a two-player mode

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
turns they do have a two-player mode
where<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.020> play<00:01:46.350> against<00:01:46.649> someone<00:01:47.040> else

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
where you can play against someone else

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780 
where you can play against someone else
that's<00:01:47.970> next<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.579> make

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that's next to you so it's like you make

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
that's next to you so it's like you make
your<00:01:50.939> turn<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> tablet<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.530> phone<00:01:52.590> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
your turn on the tablet or phone or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
your turn on the tablet or phone or
whatever<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:53.939> hand<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> them<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
whatever then you hand it to them and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
whatever then you hand it to them and
they<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.350> their<00:01:55.530> turn<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.579> date<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
they make their turn and then date you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
they make their turn and then date you
hand<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> back<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.439> make<00:01:58.619> their

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hand it back to you and you make their

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
hand it back to you and you make their
turn<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.340> turn<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.479> basically<00:02:00.780> like

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350

the only way you can play unless you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.480 
the only way you can play unless you
want<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.770> wait<00:02:05.040> online<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.969> everyone
