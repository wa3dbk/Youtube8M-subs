got<00:01:14.790> fantastic<00:01:15.119> flexibility<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> see

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
got fantastic flexibility we can see

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
got fantastic flexibility we can see
through<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.670> through<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> hips

through pointed toes it's definitely

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
through pointed toes it's definitely
worth<00:01:24.330> considering<00:01:25.020> tuning<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.070> leg

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220

and get those legs up as high as you can
behind<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.229> body<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.520> excellent

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
behind the body but that's an excellent

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.719 
behind the body but that's an excellent
shot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> flexible<00:01:42.930> ankles<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:44.399> worth<00:01:44.549> doing

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
shot of flexible ankles it's worth doing

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.999 
shot of flexible ankles it's worth doing
the<00:01:44.850> stretching<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.649> trying<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> make<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the stretching and trying to make that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
the stretching and trying to make that
as<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.579> possibly<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
as good as you can possibly get it in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.399 
as good as you can possibly get it in
the<00:01:48.780> water

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.789 

okay<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.399> going<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.640> look<00:01:54.820> at<00:01:55.600> other<00:01:56.350> an<00:01:56.530> angle

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
okay so going to look at other an angle

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.080 
okay so going to look at other an angle
here<00:01:56.979> which<00:01:57.189> I<00:01:57.340> actually<00:01:57.460> called<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.880> killer

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
here which I actually called the killer

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.969 
here which I actually called the killer
angle<00:01:58.450> from<00:01:58.750> above<00:01:59.020> this<00:01:59.200> there's<00:01:59.560> no<00:01:59.680> hiding

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
angle from above this there's no hiding

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.469 
angle from above this there's no hiding
from<00:02:00.189> this<00:02:00.579> angle<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> bit<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.329> unique

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
from this angle it's a bit of a unique

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.539 
from this angle it's a bit of a unique
one<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.110> terms<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.680> when<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.250> have<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.399> video

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
one in terms of when you have a video

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.240 
one in terms of when you have a video
analysis<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.530> one<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.829> you<00:02:05.920> can<00:02:06.070> really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
analysis it's one that you can really

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.679 
analysis it's one that you can really
survey<00:02:06.549> every<00:02:06.909> single<00:02:07.240> element<00:02:07.539> of<00:02:07.570> your

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
survey every single element of your

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.199 
survey every single element of your
stroke<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.349> in<00:02:09.190> Lizzy's<00:02:09.489> case<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.060> see

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
stroke so in Lizzy's case we can see

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.490 
stroke so in Lizzy's case we can see
really<00:02:10.420> clearly<00:02:10.750> there<00:02:10.989> on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> left<00:02:11.319> side

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
really clearly there on the left side

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.229 
really clearly there on the left side
that<00:02:11.709> she's<00:02:11.860> going<00:02:12.040> in<00:02:12.220> with<00:02:12.489> her<00:02:12.670> thumb<00:02:12.880> first

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
that she's going in with her thumb first

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.300 
that she's going in with her thumb first
rather<00:02:13.660> fingertips<00:02:14.260> first<00:02:14.530> which<00:02:14.769> is<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> lot<00:02:15.099> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
rather fingertips first which is a lot a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830 
rather fingertips first which is a lot a

of her head crossing over that center

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.180 
of her head crossing over that center
line<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.390> if<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.690> watch<00:02:22.870> her<00:02:23.050> sort<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.410> roll

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130 
line and if you watch her sort of roll
on<00:02:24.370> through<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:25.150> will<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.540> an<00:02:25.660> effect<00:02:25.750> in

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
on through that will have an effect in

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750 
on through that will have an effect in
terms<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.500> creating<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.010> bit<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.580> scissor

terms of creating a bit of a scissor

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.680 
terms of creating a bit of a scissor
kick<00:02:27.849> behind<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:30.160> would<00:02:31.060> call<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.239> lateral

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
kick behind so I would call that lateral

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.089 
kick behind so I would call that lateral
drag<00:02:31.989> when<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.920> swimmer

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
drag when we see that in the swimmer

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.470 
drag when we see that in the swimmer
it's<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.400> bit<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.700> opening<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> parachute

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's a bit like opening a parachute

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.089 
it's a bit like opening a parachute
behind<00:02:34.690> even<00:02:35.140> though<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.440> not<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.860> great

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
behind even though it's not not great

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.820 
behind even though it's not not great
not<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.880> know<00:02:37.060> too<00:02:37.599> significant<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.290> Lizzie's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
not you know too significant in Lizzie's

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.470 
not you know too significant in Lizzie's
case<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.670> definitely<00:02:39.849> worth<00:02:40.209> with<00:02:40.450> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
case it just definitely worth with a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.780 
case it just definitely worth with a
swimmer<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.200> level<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.620> ability<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
swimmer of this level of ability to to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.150 
swimmer of this level of ability to to
reduce<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.239> where<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.709> try<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.010> get

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
reduce that where we can and try and get

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.800 
reduce that where we can and try and get
her<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.340> align<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.910> left<00:02:46.120> hand<00:02:46.329> as<00:02:46.450> nicely

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
her to align that left hand as nicely

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.150 
her to align that left hand as nicely
she's<00:02:47.079> aligning<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> right<00:02:47.799> hand<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.130> front

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
she's aligning the right hand in front

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.940 
she's aligning the right hand in front
of<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> shoulders<00:02:48.790> nice<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.630> straight<00:02:49.950> which

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
of the shoulders nice and straight which

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.339 
of the shoulders nice and straight which
is<00:02:50.980> providing<00:02:51.400> good<00:02:51.549> stability<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.299> went<00:02:52.510> for

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
her to turn to breathe we can see her

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.300 
her to turn to breathe we can see her
breathing<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:56.530> quite<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> lot<00:02:57.099> of<00:02:57.130> rotation

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
breathing with quite a lot of rotation

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.069 
breathing with quite a lot of rotation
there<00:02:57.730> we<00:02:57.819> can<00:02:58.150> see<00:02:58.269> two<00:02:58.420> goggles<00:02:58.780> out<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
there we can see two goggles out of the

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.229 
there we can see two goggles out of the
water<00:02:59.230> rather<00:03:00.130> than<00:03:00.190> keeping<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.579> head<00:03:00.730> nicely

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
water rather than keeping a head nicely

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.300 
water rather than keeping a head nicely
placed<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> water<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.799> do<00:03:02.950> some<00:03:03.130> little

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
placed in the water so we do some little

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.920 
placed in the water so we do some little
tuning<00:03:03.640> up<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.299> part<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> Strait

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
tuning up on that as part of the Strait

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.840 
tuning up on that as part of the Strait
correction<00:03:05.290> part<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> session<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.670> just

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
correction part of the session and just

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.520 
correction part of the session and just
get<00:03:07.090> her<00:03:07.269> literally<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.019> turning<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.380> head

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
get her literally just turning the head

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.729 
get her literally just turning the head
in<00:03:08.739> time<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.549> body<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:11.139> that<00:03:11.260> hopefully

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
in time with the body and that hopefully

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.170 
in time with the body and that hopefully
by<00:03:12.100> aligning<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.519> left<00:03:12.700> hand<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.970> little<00:03:13.000> bit

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
by aligning that left hand a little bit

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.370

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
better to we're going to be able to sort

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.620 
better to we're going to be able to sort
that<00:03:14.560> leg<00:03:14.739> kick<00:03:14.950> out<00:03:15.370> behind<00:03:15.790> her<00:03:16.060> keeping<00:03:16.510> it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that leg kick out behind her keeping it

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.780 
that leg kick out behind her keeping it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
time when she's swimming all right so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.270 
time when she's swimming all right so
just<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> finish<00:03:22.989> off<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.680> video

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
just to finish off with the video

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.129 
just to finish off with the video
footage<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.910> we've<00:03:25.000> got<00:03:25.180> Lizzie's<00:03:25.870> putting

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
footage that we've got Lizzie's putting

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.020 
footage that we've got Lizzie's putting
in<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> couple<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.500> faster<00:03:27.220> length<00:03:27.400> efforts

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
in a couple of faster length efforts

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.599 
in a couple of faster length efforts
here<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.389> to<00:03:28.510> finish<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.310> look<00:03:30.310> at<00:03:30.430> how<00:03:30.549> the

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
here just to finish and look at how the

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.280 
here just to finish and look at how the
stroke<00:03:30.880> might<00:03:31.299> change<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.810> adapt<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.079> little

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
stroke might change and adapt a little

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.530 
stroke might change and adapt a little
bit<00:03:32.380> under<00:03:32.739> under<00:03:33.160> pressure<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.329> can<00:03:34.420> see

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
bit under under pressure so we can see

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.770 
bit under under pressure so we can see
that<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:35.049> catch<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.500> naturally<00:03:35.889> starting<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that that catch is naturally starting to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.330 
that that catch is naturally starting to
gravitate<00:03:37.780> towards<00:03:38.319> probably<00:03:38.650> what<00:03:39.040> she<00:03:39.220> was

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
gravitate towards probably what she was

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.370 
gravitate towards probably what she was
doing<00:03:39.639> before<00:03:39.790> she<00:03:40.269> maybe<00:03:40.690> started<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.079> overly

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
doing before she maybe started to overly

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.410 
doing before she maybe started to overly
lengthen<00:03:41.739> her<00:03:41.889> stroke<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.329> to

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
lengthen her stroke so this is going to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.270 
lengthen her stroke so this is going to
form<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.690> basis<00:03:44.079> for<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.590> three<00:03:45.040> key

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
form the basis for the three key

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.460 
form the basis for the three key
recommendations<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.239> usually<00:03:46.510> make<00:03:46.840> with

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
recommendations that I usually make with

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
some clear a clear plan to go on with so

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.039 
some clear a clear plan to go on with so
for<00:03:54.489> Lizzie<00:03:54.609> it's<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.630> key<00:03:55.780> things

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
for Lizzie it's the the key things

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.390 
for Lizzie it's the the key things
really<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.470> sorting<00:03:56.859> out<00:03:56.980> this<00:03:57.099> alignment

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
really just sorting out this alignment

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.819 
really just sorting out this alignment
at<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.700> front<00:03:57.849> of<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.000> stroke<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:58.959> open

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
at the front of the stroke so that open

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.439 
at the front of the stroke so that open

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
water is her key priority really in

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.659 
water is her key priority really in

it's<00:04:06.069> when<00:04:06.250> we're<00:04:06.760> going<00:04:06.879> to<00:04:06.940> look<00:04:07.150> at

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
it's when we're going to look at

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.940 
it's when we're going to look at
correcting<00:04:07.659> this<00:04:07.810> left<00:04:08.019> arm<00:04:08.170> going<00:04:08.680> into<00:04:08.860> the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
correcting this left arm going into the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.559 
correcting this left arm going into the
water<00:04:09.099> in<00:04:09.250> front<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.519> shoulder<00:04:09.879> getting

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
water in front of the shoulder getting

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.940 
water in front of the shoulder getting
some<00:04:10.750> nice<00:04:10.840> feedback<00:04:11.110> from<00:04:11.530> some<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
some nice feedback from some of the

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.770 
some nice feedback from some of the
alignment<00:04:12.370> drills<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.790> she<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.150> do<00:04:13.299> on<00:04:13.629> her

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
alignment drills that she can do on her

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.300 
alignment drills that she can do on her
own<00:04:13.959> when<00:04:14.230> she<00:04:14.379> goes<00:04:14.500> away<00:04:14.709> from<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:14.980> session

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
own when she goes away from the session

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.670 
own when she goes away from the session
so<00:04:15.489> she<00:04:15.549> got<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:16.030> good<00:04:16.540> feel<00:04:16.840> for<00:04:17.109> where<00:04:17.650> she

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
so she got a good feel for where she

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860 
so she got a good feel for where she
needs<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:17.979> be<00:04:18.040> putting<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.370> arm<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.810> she

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
needs to be putting that arm in so she

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.689 
needs to be putting that arm in so she
can<00:04:19.989> stay<00:04:20.169> on<00:04:20.199> course<00:04:20.620> when<00:04:21.310> she's<00:04:21.459> out<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.639> the

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
can stay on course when she's out in the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.000 
can stay on course when she's out in the
open<00:04:22.000> water<00:04:22.150> make<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:23.110> lot<00:04:23.350> easier<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.740> her

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
open water make it a lot easier for her

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.100 
open water make it a lot easier for her
to<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.669> improve<00:04:24.910> on<00:04:25.180> her<00:04:25.360> swim<00:04:25.570> time<00:04:25.840> which<00:04:25.990> is

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
to to improve on her swim time which is

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.140 
to to improve on her swim time which is

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
region 43.8 case the second thing we

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.930 
region 43.8 case the second thing we
look<00:04:31.600> at<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:32.280> modifying<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.430> catch<00:04:33.669> at<00:04:33.910> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
look at is modifying this catch at the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.780 
look at is modifying this catch at the
front<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.389> stroke<00:04:34.680> we<00:04:35.680> would<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:36.040> aiming

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
front of the stroke we would be aiming

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.820 
front of the stroke we would be aiming
to<00:04:36.880> get<00:04:37.000> Lizzie<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.449> to<00:04:38.110> improve<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.620> catch

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
to get Lizzie to to improve that catch

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.010 
to get Lizzie to to improve that catch
so<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.100> finger<00:04:39.340> tips<00:04:39.550> are<00:04:39.699> down<00:04:39.960> rather<00:04:40.960> than

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
so the finger tips are down rather than

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.510 
so the finger tips are down rather than
scooping<00:04:41.380> up<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.650> surface<00:04:41.949> of<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.070> water

scooping up to the surface of the water

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.939 
scooping up to the surface of the water

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389
