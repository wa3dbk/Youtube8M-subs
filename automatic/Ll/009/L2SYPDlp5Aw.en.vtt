00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.240 
david Langan Langer's he actually
designed<00:00:31.960> all<00:00:32.110> these<00:00:32.259> graphics<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:33.070> worked

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
designed all these graphics and worked

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.930 
designed all these graphics and worked
really<00:00:33.339> closely<00:00:33.730> with<00:00:34.769> decore<00:00:35.769> to<00:00:36.129> have<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
really closely with decore to have the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.220 
really closely with decore to have the
way<00:00:37.059> they<00:00:37.180> looked<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.600> then<00:00:37.720> really<00:00:37.900> dialed

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
way they looked and then really dialed

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.350 
way they looked and then really dialed
him<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.440> he<00:00:39.250> went<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.489> Jay<00:00:39.640> Clark<00:00:39.879> for<00:00:40.120> some<00:00:40.269> of

him in he went to Jay Clark for some of
the<00:00:40.420> specs<00:00:40.720> on<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.050> thing<00:00:41.260> we'll<00:00:41.440> go<00:00:41.530> over

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
the specs on this thing we'll go over

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.799 
the specs on this thing we'll go over
some<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.829> that<00:00:41.920> later<00:00:42.159> but<00:00:42.690> pretty<00:00:43.690> much

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
at Rock Rocky Mountain ATV so we'll go

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.799 
at Rock Rocky Mountain ATV so we'll go
over<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:49.030> we're<00:00:49.239> going<00:00:49.329> to<00:00:49.390> get<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:49.600> thing

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
over that we're going to get this thing

00:00:49.809 --> 00:02:06.230 
over that we're going to get this thing
out<00:00:49.899> on<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.050> track<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.440> see<00:00:50.620> how<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.800> works

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.249 

alright<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.360> we<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.600> climbed<00:02:07.870> off<00:02:08.050> this

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
alright so we just climbed off this

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.950 
alright so we just climbed off this
thing<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:10.210> know<00:02:10.300> right<00:02:10.509> away<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.720> my

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
thing and you know right away that my

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.690 
thing and you know right away that my
first<00:02:11.200> impression<00:02:11.710> was<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.190> was<00:02:12.370> surprised

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
first impression was I was surprised

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.060 
first impression was I was surprised
that<00:02:12.910> we<00:02:13.120> didn't<00:02:13.450> lose<00:02:13.570> some<00:02:13.810> top<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.440> lot<00:02:14.980> of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
that we didn't lose some top in a lot of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.650 
that we didn't lose some top in a lot of
times<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> throw<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> 270<00:02:16.180> kit<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.570> of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
times you throw a 270 kit in one of

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.750 
times you throw a 270 kit in one of
these<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.560> get<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.710> big<00:02:17.950> bunch<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.490> torque

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
these and you get a big bunch of torque

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.340 
these and you get a big bunch of torque
off<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.120> bottom<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.540> good<00:02:19.720> hit<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.140> turn

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
off the bottom a good hit out of a turn

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.590 
off the bottom a good hit out of a turn
and<00:02:20.500> then<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.740> goes<00:02:20.860> flat<00:02:21.100> right<00:02:21.340> away<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
and then it goes flat right away and it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.970 
and then it goes flat right away and it
just<00:02:22.810> didn't<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.200> didn't<00:02:23.470> happen<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.770> this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
just didn't it didn't happen on this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.760 
just didn't it didn't happen on this
vertex<00:02:24.460> piston<00:02:25.030> stage<00:02:25.360> too<00:02:25.600> hot<00:02:25.810> cam<00:02:26.080> with

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
vertex piston stage too hot cam with

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.070 
vertex piston stage too hot cam with
this<00:02:26.920> FMF<00:02:27.400> exhaust<00:02:27.760> system<00:02:28.210> was<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.990> an

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
this FMF exhaust system was just an

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.440 
this FMF exhaust system was just an
awesome<00:02:29.530> combination<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.370> thing<00:02:30.580> definitely

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
awesome combination the thing definitely

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
awesome combination the thing definitely
has<00:02:31.840> more<00:02:32.050> torque<00:02:32.230> out<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.650> turn<00:02:32.860> it'll

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
has more torque out of the turn it'll

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.680 
has more torque out of the turn it'll
pull<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> heavier<00:02:33.730> guy<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.330> weigh<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.510> little

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
pull a heavier guy if you weigh a little

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.240 
pull a heavier guy if you weigh a little
bit<00:02:34.900> more<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> you're<00:02:35.590> not<00:02:35.740> sure<00:02:35.770> about

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
bit more and you're not sure about

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.820 
bit more and you're not sure about
riding<00:02:36.400> at<00:02:36.550> 250<00:02:36.940> F<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.990> great<00:02:38.290> solution

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
riding at 250 F this is a great solution

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.949 
riding at 250 F this is a great solution
for<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.160> because<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.120> does<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.600> extra

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
for you because it does have that extra

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.510 
for you because it does have that extra
torque<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.470> still<00:02:41.770> pulls<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.310> top

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
torque but it still pulls on the top

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.030 
torque but it still pulls on the top
it's<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> great<00:02:42.970> motor<00:02:43.209> package<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:44.709> coupled

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
it's a great motor package they coupled

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's a great motor package they coupled
that<00:02:45.130> with<00:02:45.190> some<00:02:45.430> race<00:02:45.580> tech<00:02:45.820> suspension<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
that with some race tech suspension and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.380 
that with some race tech suspension and
it's<00:02:47.500> set<00:02:47.709> up<00:02:47.740> for<00:02:47.830> our<00:02:48.010> designer<00:02:48.280> langars<00:02:48.790> but

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
it's set up for our designer langars but

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.699 
it's set up for our designer langars but
still<00:02:49.630> worked<00:02:49.810> really<00:02:49.959> well<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.350> me<00:02:50.470> nice<00:02:50.650> and

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
still worked really well for me nice and

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.070 
still worked really well for me nice and
plush<00:02:51.130> in<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> little<00:02:51.580> bumps<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.080> really

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
plush in the little bumps so really

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.220 
plush in the little bumps so really
stoked<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.800> race<00:02:54.070> tech<00:02:54.340> set<00:02:54.580> up<00:02:54.700> here

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
stoked on on race tech set up here

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.440 
stoked on on race tech set up here
decore<00:02:56.260> did<00:02:56.770> all<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.920> our<00:02:57.070> graphics<00:02:57.610> Langer's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
decore did all of our graphics Langer's

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.850 
decore did all of our graphics Langer's
designed<00:02:58.840> them<00:02:59.020> but<00:02:59.170> these<00:02:59.260> guys<00:02:59.470> printed

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
designed them but these guys printed

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.710 
designed them but these guys printed
them<00:02:59.980> out<00:03:00.100> for<00:03:00.370> us<00:03:00.550> coupled<00:03:01.300> it<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.510> nice

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
them out for us coupled it with a nice

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.090 
them out for us coupled it with a nice
