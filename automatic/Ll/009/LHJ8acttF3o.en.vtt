out of it we want to see what the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
out of it we want to see what the
quickest<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.439> give<00:00:31.679> now<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.099> at

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
quickest time we can give now I know at

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.799 
quickest time we can give now I know at
one<00:00:32.309> point<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.880> happy<00:00:33.300> when<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> got<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
one point I was happy when I got in a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.470 
one point I was happy when I got in a
minute<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.610> think<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.790> possible<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.360> get

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
minute I think it's possible to get

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
minute I think it's possible to get
under<00:00:36.690> 40<00:00:37.079> seconds<00:00:37.649> maybe<00:00:38.250> impossible<00:00:38.700> under

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
under 40 seconds maybe impossible under

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630 
under 40 seconds maybe impossible under
30<00:00:39.690> seconds<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.579> all

the first round the fastest so I got

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
the first round the fastest so I got
this<00:01:01.739> idea<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.760> where<00:01:03.920> hopefully

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this idea right here where hopefully

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.520 
this idea right here where hopefully
with<00:01:05.129> triple<00:01:05.489> h<00:01:05.670> his<00:01:06.330> second<00:01:06.840> special<00:01:07.320> does<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with triple h his second special does a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.179 
with triple h his second special does a
ton<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> damage<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.600> 53,000<00:01:09.600> Plus<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
ton of damage like 53,000 Plus this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.670

triple<00:01:11.640> H<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.820> giving<00:01:12.330> him<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> 20%<00:01:13.439> buff

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
triple H is giving him like a 20% buff

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
triple H is giving him like a 20% buff
and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.100> she's<00:01:14.369> giving<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> 5%<00:01:15.450> buff<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.840> should

second special and also Undertaker now

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.820 
second special and also Undertaker now
the<00:01:21.330> trick<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.970> using<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the trick is this is using this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
the trick is this is using this
Chairman's<00:01:25.830> suit<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.430> starts<00:01:26.820> me<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.150> with

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Chairman's suit which starts me off with

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
Chairman's suit which starts me off with
the<00:01:27.600> bar<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> energy<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the bar of energy now if I got this

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
the bar of energy now if I got this
although<00:01:29.430> he<00:01:29.520> mixed<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> start<00:01:30.479> off<00:01:30.570> with

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
although he mixed out I start off with

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
although he mixed out I start off with
two<00:01:30.930> bars<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.470> energy<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.040> would<00:01:32.310> be

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
two bars of energy so that would be

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.899 
two bars of energy so that would be
ideal

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
ideal

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.050 
ideal
