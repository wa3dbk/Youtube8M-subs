4 plate with a 1 by 4 tile 2 1 by 1

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.740 
4 plate with a 1 by 4 tile 2 1 by 1
tiles<00:02:37.840> right<00:02:38.080> here<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:40.150> what<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.510> want

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
tiles right here and then what you want

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.430 
tiles right here and then what you want
is<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:43.770> 1<00:02:44.770> by<00:02:44.980> 2<00:02:45.040> with<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> X<00:02:46.300> hole<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.870> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
is this 1 by 2 with a X hole in it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.410 
is this 1 by 2 with a X hole in it
a<00:02:49.770> 1<00:02:50.770> by<00:02:51.010> 2<00:02:51.070> with<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.930> circle<00:02:52.930> hole<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:54.270> 1<00:02:55.270> by

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
a 1 by 2 with a circle hole in it 1 by

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.460 
a 1 by 2 with a circle hole in it 1 by
another<00:02:56.290> 1<00:02:57.070> by<00:02:57.220> 2<00:02:57.360> with<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.390> circle<00:02:58.960> hole<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.320> it

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
another 1 by 2 with a circle hole in it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.700 
another 1 by 2 with a circle hole in it
and<00:03:00.210> then<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:02.190> another<00:03:03.190> 1<00:03:03.610> by<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> 2<00:03:04.000> with<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.960> X

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
and then a another 1 by a 2 with a X

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.550 
and then a another 1 by a 2 with a X
hole<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.850> should<00:03:07.030> be<00:03:07.320> circle<00:03:08.320> X

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
hole in it so it should be circle X

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.730 
hole in it so it should be circle X
circle<00:03:09.220> X<00:03:10.170> again<00:03:11.170> circle<00:03:11.920> X<00:03:12.250> circle<00:03:13.060> X<00:03:13.740> and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
circle X again circle X circle X and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.150 
circle X again circle X circle X and
then<00:03:15.550> just<00:03:16.000> you're<00:03:16.989> almost<00:03:17.620> done

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
then just you're almost done

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.390 
then just you're almost done
