and<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:45.239> said<00:00:45.750> took<00:00:45.930> him<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.170> 23<00:00:46.739> minutes<00:00:47.010> to

and I said took him like 23 minutes to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.610 
and I said took him like 23 minutes to
to<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.480> enough<00:00:48.719> points<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> because

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to get enough points to do it because

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
to get enough points to do it because
you<00:00:49.829> run<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.219> ammo<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.730> fast<00:00:51.030> yet<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you run out of ammo so fast yet it just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.950 
you run out of ammo so fast yet it just
kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> knife<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:53.510> didn't<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
kind of knife I didn't really want to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
kind of knife I didn't really want to
take<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:57.110> time<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.440> guess<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.219> did

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
take on that much time I guess but I did

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
take on that much time I guess but I did
think<00:00:59.789> getting<00:01:00.570> juggernaut<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.140> round<00:01:01.410> one

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
think getting juggernaut and round one

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
think getting juggernaut and round one
would<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> pretty<00:01:02.039> cool<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> decided<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
would be pretty cool so I decided to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
would be pretty cool so I decided to
take<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:04.020> at<00:01:04.170> lupin<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.890> well<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
take a look at lupin in here as well and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.430 
take a look at lupin in here as well and
it's<00:01:06.149> actually<00:01:06.270> pretty<00:01:06.570> easy<00:01:06.690> once<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.259> get

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
it's actually pretty easy once you get

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.320 
it's actually pretty easy once you get
used<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.850> where<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> sprint<00:01:11.240> just<00:01:12.240> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
used to where you have to sprint just so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.540 
used to where you have to sprint just so
you<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.509> get<00:01:12.660> stuck<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.890> hardest<00:01:14.160> part<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
you don't get stuck the hardest part is

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.010 
you don't get stuck the hardest part is
actually<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.209> very<00:01:15.390> beginning<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.869> soon

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
actually at the very beginning as soon

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.540 
actually at the very beginning as soon
as<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.200> start<00:01:16.440> going<00:01:16.530> fast<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.429> the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
as they start going fast because all the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.400 
as they start going fast because all the
zombies<00:01:17.700> haven't<00:01:18.090> spawned<00:01:18.450> yet<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.229> once

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
zombies haven't spawned yet but once

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.690 
zombies haven't spawned yet but once
they<00:01:19.530> all<00:01:19.560> spot<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.039> there<00:01:20.160> behind<00:01:20.399> you<00:01:20.550> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they all spot on there behind you it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
they all spot on there behind you it's
really<00:01:21.119> easy<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.599> I<00:01:22.080> usually<00:01:22.440> save<00:01:22.679> my<00:01:22.860> sprint

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
really easy and I usually save my sprint

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820 
really easy and I usually save my sprint
when<00:01:23.459> they're<00:01:23.610> spawning<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.319> saved<00:01:25.319> my<00:01:25.470> sprint

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
when they're spawning I saved my sprint

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.630 
when they're spawning I saved my sprint
for<00:01:26.160> right<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:28.310> that's<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.429> part

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
for right about here that's the part

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
for right about here that's the part
that<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.849> kept<00:01:30.030> getting<00:01:30.119> caught<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.630> but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that I kept getting caught on but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
that I kept getting caught on but
depending<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.069> how<00:01:32.160> many<00:01:32.220> stab<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.330> should<00:01:33.569> be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
depending on how many stab you should be

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.570 
depending on how many stab you should be
able<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.050> get<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> 2500<00:01:34.920> points<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.220> need<00:01:35.280> for

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
able to get the 2500 points you need for

extra<00:01:55.560> points<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.910> start<00:01:57.179> of<00:01:57.239> the<00:01:57.270> round

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
extra points for the start of the round

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.380 
extra points for the start of the round
but<00:01:58.709> I<00:01:58.739> guess<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.489> you<00:01:59.580> were<00:01:59.700> ambitious<00:01:59.819> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
but I guess if you were ambitious you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.540 
but I guess if you were ambitious you
could<00:02:00.630> stay<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.470> here<00:02:01.709> now<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.099> you<00:02:02.160> have<00:02:02.190> jug

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
could stay in here now that you have jug

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.669 
could stay in here now that you have jug
and<00:02:03.110> keep<00:02:04.110> knifing<00:02:05.899> 500<00:02:06.899> times<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
and keep knifing 500 times to get the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.619 
and keep knifing 500 times to get the
5000<00:02:08.340> points<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.849> need<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.090> mustang

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
5000 points you would need for mustang

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.780 
5000 points you would need for mustang
and<00:02:09.720> Sally<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.229> didn't<00:02:11.220> feel<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.370> doing<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and Sally I didn't feel like doing that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
and Sally I didn't feel like doing that
right<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.420> kudos<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.140> convergence<00:02:13.680> II

what you have your jug the first several
rounds<00:02:21.329> are<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:21.840> easy<00:02:22.370> because<00:02:23.370> you're

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
rounds are really easy because you're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280 
rounds are really easy because you're
used<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.969> knife<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.450> anyway<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.049> now<00:02:25.079> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
used to knife and I'm anyway and now you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
used to knife and I'm anyway and now you
have<00:02:25.439> Juggernog<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.819> round<00:02:27.120> 1<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:28.670> 1<00:02:29.670> through<00:02:30.000> 4

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
have Juggernog in round 1 so 1 through 4

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.220 
have Juggernog in round 1 so 1 through 4
or<00:02:30.689> 5<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.799> pretty<00:02:32.040> easy<00:02:32.750> first<00:02:33.750> thing<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.049> try

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
or 5 it is pretty easy first thing I try

or 5 it is pretty easy first thing I try
to<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.439> is<00:02:34.650> make<00:02:35.129> my<00:02:35.280> way<00:02:35.459> over<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.819> ak-74

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
to do is make my way over to the ak-74

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.849 
to do is make my way over to the ak-74
room<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:39.299> out<00:02:39.599> here<00:02:39.629> where<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.379> the

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
room it's it's out here where the the

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.490 
room it's it's out here where the the
new<00:02:41.010> park<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> three<00:02:42.439> the<00:02:43.439> three<00:02:43.709> guns<00:02:43.950> is

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
new park for the three the three guns is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.679 
new park for the three the three guns is
get<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> ak-74<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.639> off<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.909> wall<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.450> then

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
get the ak-74 you off the wall and then

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.330 
get the ak-74 you off the wall and then
I<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:48.989> kind<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.290> loop<00:02:49.469> around<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.980> room

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
I just kind of loop around this room

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.720 
I just kind of loop around this room
making<00:02:51.060> points<00:02:52.189> the<00:02:53.189> first<00:02:53.430> order<00:02:53.639> of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
making points the first order of

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.420 
making points the first order of
business<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.420> get<00:02:54.689> Mustang<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.139> Sally<00:02:55.439> so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
business is to get Mustang and Sally so

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.580 
business is to get Mustang and Sally so
this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.909> what<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.840> i<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
this is what I do to do that i get the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.869 
this is what I do to do that i get the
ak-74<00:02:59.129> make<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> bunch<00:03:00.389> of<00:03:00.510> points<00:03:00.689> and<00:03:01.700> as<00:03:02.700> soon

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
ak-74 make a bunch of points and as soon

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.020 
ak-74 make a bunch of points and as soon
as<00:03:03.000> i<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.180> afford<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:03.780> i<00:03:03.900> go<00:03:04.049> get<00:03:04.849> PhD<00:03:05.849> flopper

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
as i can afford it i go get PhD flopper

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.780 
as i can afford it i go get PhD flopper
and<00:03:06.569> then<00:03:07.530> i<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.739> upgrade<00:03:07.889> Mustang<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.519> Sally

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
and then i go upgrade Mustang and Sally

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.809 
and then i go upgrade Mustang and Sally
so<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.379> basic<00:03:10.980> loop<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.609> around

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
so the the basic loop is just around

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.149 
so the the basic loop is just around
this<00:03:12.000> big<00:03:12.209> rock<00:03:12.480> here<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.709> really<00:03:13.919> take

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
this big rock here you can really take

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.710 
this big rock here you can really take
it<00:03:14.280> either<00:03:14.370> direction<00:03:14.790> doesn't<00:03:15.150> really<00:03:15.480> seem

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it either direction doesn't really seem

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500 
it either direction doesn't really seem
to<00:03:15.840> matter<00:03:16.430> there's<00:03:17.430> lots<00:03:17.669> of<00:03:17.819> room<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.299> run

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
to matter there's lots of room to run

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.920 
to matter there's lots of room to run
and<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> have<00:03:20.549> jug<00:03:20.909> you<00:03:21.209> shouldn't<00:03:21.780> really

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and if you have jug you shouldn't really

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.409 
and if you have jug you shouldn't really
get<00:03:22.169> in<00:03:22.260> too<00:03:22.379> much<00:03:22.409> trouble<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:23.159> as<00:03:23.419> the

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
get in too much trouble here as the

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.909 
get in too much trouble here as the
rounds<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:25.109> bit<00:03:25.199> later<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.739> nice

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
rounds get a little bit later it's nice

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.680 
rounds get a little bit later it's nice
to<00:03:26.099> have<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> mustang<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.790> Sally<00:03:27.030> insurance

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
to have the mustang and Sally insurance

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.490 
to have the mustang and Sally insurance
but<00:03:28.190> right<00:03:29.190> now<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.419> 74<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.109> will<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.409> you

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
but right now you the 74 you will do you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.309 
but right now you the 74 you will do you
fine<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.430> keep<00:03:32.639> loop<00:03:32.849> around<00:03:33.000> here<00:03:33.479> by

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
fine so I just keep loop around here by

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.770 
fine so I just keep loop around here by
an<00:03:34.440> ammo<00:03:34.620> off<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.040> wall<00:03:35.269> until<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.750> afford

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
an ammo off the wall until I can afford

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.089 
an ammo off the wall until I can afford
to<00:03:37.409> get<00:03:38.400> PhD<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:39.389> mustang<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.810> Sally<00:03:43.099> you

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
to get PhD and get mustang and Sally you

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.619 
to get PhD and get mustang and Sally you
can<00:03:44.220> see<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.400> hit<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.639> box<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.090> got<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> Khalil

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
can see I hit the box and got a Khalil

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.879 
can see I hit the box and got a Khalil
here<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.290> I've<00:03:46.949> got<00:03:47.340> my<00:03:47.459> PhD<00:03:47.669> now<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:49.709> just

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
here and I've got my PhD now and I just

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.289 
here and I've got my PhD now and I just
kept<00:03:50.069> looking<00:03:50.220> around<00:03:50.400> until<00:03:50.729> that<00:03:50.879> happened

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
kept looking around until that happened

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.479 
kept looking around until that happened
when<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.229> run<00:03:52.379> out<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.620> pack<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.859> punch<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.340> got

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
when you run out to pack a punch you got

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.520 
when you run out to pack a punch you got

to run straight to the machine and pack
it<00:03:55.560> right<00:03:55.859> away<00:03:55.979> because<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:57.060> get<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> really

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
brief amount of time here where there's

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.750 
brief amount of time here where there's

not some bees all over you but as soon

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.360 
not some bees all over you but as soon
as<00:04:02.879> you<00:04:02.970> get<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.299> mustang<00:04:03.629> sally<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.379> i

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
as you get the mustang sally and i

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.429 
as you get the mustang sally and i
bought<00:04:05.819> PhD<00:04:06.299> before<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.689> came<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.109> here<00:04:07.260> so

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
bought PhD before I came out of here so

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.689 
bought PhD before I came out of here so
that<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.620> could<00:04:07.709> stay<00:04:07.949> out<00:04:08.040> here<00:04:08.099> just<00:04:08.430> kind<00:04:08.669> of

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
that I could stay out here just kind of

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.210 
that I could stay out here just kind of
loop<00:04:08.909> and<00:04:09.090> make<00:04:09.209> up<00:04:09.329> some<00:04:09.510> more<00:04:09.659> points<00:04:10.220> when

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
loop and make up some more points when

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.920 
loop and make up some more points when
you<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.459> Mustang<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:11.879> Sally<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.449> it's<00:04:12.810> a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
you have Mustang and Sally it's it's a

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.089 
you have Mustang and Sally it's it's a
really<00:04:13.379> easy<00:04:13.500> loop<00:04:14.449> you<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:16.590> make<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> ton<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
really easy loop you you make a ton of

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.569 
really easy loop you you make a ton of
points<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:18.859> until<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:19.979> run<00:04:20.099> out<00:04:20.159> of<00:04:20.310> ammo

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
points and until you run out of ammo

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.790 
points and until you run out of ammo
with<00:04:20.789> Mustang<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.209> Sally<00:04:21.479> or<00:04:21.870> you're<00:04:22.259> really

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
with Mustang and Sally or you're really

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.790 
with Mustang and Sally or you're really
not<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.220> any<00:04:23.310> danger<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:24.960> took<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.380> Galil<00:04:25.680> I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
not in any danger so I took the Galil I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.320 
not in any danger so I took the Galil I
just<00:04:25.979> got<00:04:26.130> out<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.219> the<00:04:26.310> box<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.880> basically

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
just got out of the box and basically

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.879 
just got out of the box and basically
just<00:04:27.599> kept<00:04:27.779> looping<00:04:28.110> around<00:04:28.200> here<00:04:28.590> until<00:04:28.860> I

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
just kept looping around here until I

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.570 
just kept looping around here until I
used<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.279> all<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.580> my<00:04:29.880> Khalil

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
used up all the my Khalil

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.650 
used up all the my Khalil
because<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.640> want<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.850> make<00:04:32.910> some<00:04:33.150> more<00:04:33.240> ammo<00:04:33.450> to

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
because I want to make some more ammo to

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.940 
because I want to make some more ammo to
get<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.960> other<00:04:34.020> perks<00:04:34.320> that<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.620> wanted

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.230 

actually<00:04:37.950> this<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.430> ended<00:04:38.790> up<00:04:38.850> looping<00:04:39.150> around

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
actually this I ended up looping around

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.440 
actually this I ended up looping around
using<00:04:39.660> up<00:04:39.840> all<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.020> khalil<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:41.430> ended<00:04:42.120> up<00:04:42.210> pack

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
using up all the khalil I ended up pack

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.970 
using up all the khalil I ended up pack
of<00:04:42.630> punching<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.290> then<00:04:43.410> using<00:04:43.680> up<00:04:43.800> all<00:04:43.920> the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
of punching it and then using up all the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.030 
of punching it and then using up all the
mo<00:04:44.340> out<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.420> the<00:04:45.480> pack<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.780> 12<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.790> made<00:04:49.040> well

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
mo out of the pack of 12 and made well

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.820 
mo out of the pack of 12 and made well
it<00:04:50.310> looks<00:04:50.340> like<00:04:50.580> what<00:04:51.090> 11,000<00:04:51.930> 12,000<00:04:52.470> points

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
it looks like what 11,000 12,000 points

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.260 
it looks like what 11,000 12,000 points
just<00:04:53.070> kind<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.310> going<00:04:54.030> around<00:04:54.150> their<00:04:56.180> kind<00:04:57.180> of

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
just kind of going around their kind of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.450 
just kind of going around their kind of
a<00:04:57.390> fade<00:04:58.170> fast<00:04:58.500> forward<00:04:58.890> there<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.430> don't

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
a fade fast forward there so you don't

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.070 
a fade fast forward there so you don't
stare<00:05:00.000> watch<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.390> loop<00:05:00.720> but<00:05:00.930> that's

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
stare watch the loop but that's

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
stare watch the loop but that's
basically<00:05:01.230> all<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:01.950> just<00:05:01.980> keep<00:05:02.190> going

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
basically all you do you just keep going

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.540 
basically all you do you just keep going
around<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:03.620> using<00:05:04.620> up<00:05:04.740> all<00:05:04.860> your<00:05:04.920> ammo<00:05:05.370> and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
around and using up all your ammo and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.940 
around and using up all your ammo and
then<00:05:06.240> pack<00:05:06.450> a<00:05:06.480> punch<00:05:06.810> use<00:05:07.140> up<00:05:07.290> all<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.560> ammo

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
then pack a punch use up all that ammo

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.860 
then pack a punch use up all that ammo
and<00:05:08.130> now<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> got<00:05:08.670> a<00:05:08.700> ton<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:08.910> points<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.330> go<00:05:09.480> by

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
and now I got a ton of points to go by

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.070 
and now I got a ton of points to go by
the<00:05:09.930> /<00:05:10.140> current<00:05:10.350> want<00:05:14.240> there's<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.510> annoying

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
the / current want there's the annoying

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.630 
the / current want there's the annoying
astronaut<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.710> follows<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.160> around<00:05:17.190> and

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
astronaut that follows you around and

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.600 
astronaut that follows you around and
skills<00:05:18.000> your<00:05:18.180> perk<00:05:18.390> if<00:05:18.540> he<00:05:18.630> grabs<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:20.430> does

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
skills your perk if he grabs you it does

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.400 
skills your perk if he grabs you it does
seem<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.880> die<00:05:21.090> pretty<00:05:21.330> easily<00:05:21.600> at<00:05:22.080> least<00:05:22.260> in

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
seem to die pretty easily at least in

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.310 
seem to die pretty easily at least in
the<00:05:22.500> early<00:05:22.830> rounds<00:05:23.660> I've<00:05:24.660> not<00:05:24.840> really<00:05:24.990> made<00:05:25.200> it

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
the early rounds I've not really made it

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.410 
the early rounds I've not really made it
any<00:05:25.440> farther<00:05:25.620> than<00:05:25.830> 22<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:26.730> think<00:05:27.180> at<00:05:27.300> this

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
any farther than 22 I think at this

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.020 
any farther than 22 I think at this
point<00:05:27.480> so<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.260> can't<00:05:28.980> vouch<00:05:29.190> for<00:05:29.250> anything<00:05:29.700> much

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
point so I can't vouch for anything much

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.450 
point so I can't vouch for anything much
later<00:05:30.270> than<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.570> but<00:05:30.870> Mustang<00:05:31.800> Sally<00:05:32.160> or<00:05:32.370> an

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
later than that but Mustang Sally or an

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.380 
later than that but Mustang Sally or an
upgraded<00:05:33.590> crack<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.620> punk<00:05:34.920> weapon<00:05:35.310> will<00:05:35.520> take

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
upgraded crack a punk weapon will take

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.790 
upgraded crack a punk weapon will take
them<00:05:36.480> down<00:05:36.630> fairly<00:05:36.870> easily<00:05:39.260> so<00:05:40.260> now<00:05:40.500> I've<00:05:40.620> got
