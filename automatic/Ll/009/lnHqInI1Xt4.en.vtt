think especially today with the economy

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.040 
think especially today with the economy
being<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.429> way<00:01:01.550> it<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:02.329> making<00:01:03.019> that

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
being the way it is is making that

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.250

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
that decision knowing that they could

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.910 
that decision knowing that they could
