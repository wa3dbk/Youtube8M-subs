00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.710 

and<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.690> tutorial<00:00:05.150> I've<00:00:06.150> been<00:00:06.450> requested

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
and in this tutorial I've been requested

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.920 
and in this tutorial I've been requested
to<00:00:07.109> show<00:00:07.319> how<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> match<00:00:07.890> colors<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.600> there's

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
to show how to match colors and there's

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.169 
to show how to match colors and there's
a<00:00:10.290> couple<00:00:10.740> different<00:00:10.860> ways<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
a couple different ways to do this and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.320 
a couple different ways to do this and
I'm<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.630> show<00:00:13.730> perhaps<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.089> easiest

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
I'm going to show perhaps the easiest

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
I'm going to show perhaps the easiest
way<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> fastest<00:00:17.310> way<00:00:18.259> so<00:00:19.259> this<00:00:19.710> red<00:00:20.040> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
way in the fastest way so this red is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.900 
way in the fastest way so this red is
what<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.430> want<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.700> match<00:00:20.849> and<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.739> blue<00:00:22.739> is

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.519 

what<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> change<00:00:27.239> and<00:00:28.169> I've<00:00:28.349> already

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
what we need to change and I've already

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.490 
what we need to change and I've already
done<00:00:28.860> it

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
done it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
done it
and<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.649> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.860> show<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.099> how<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> did<00:00:32.520> first

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and I want to show you how I did first

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.680 
and I want to show you how I did first
thing<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.600> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:35.510> realize<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
thing we need to realize is that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.910 
thing we need to realize is that
Photoshop<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.080> very<00:00:40.290> powerful<00:00:40.500> tool

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Photoshop has a very powerful tool

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.320 
Photoshop has a very powerful tool
called<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> hue/saturation<00:00:42.380> adjustment

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
called the hue/saturation adjustment

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.720 
called the hue/saturation adjustment
layer<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:47.090> hue<00:00:48.090> saturation<00:00:49.310> has<00:00:50.310> a<00:00:50.370> drop<00:00:50.700> down

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
layer and hue saturation has a drop down

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
layer and hue saturation has a drop down
menu<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:54.020> has<00:00:55.820> one<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.270> three<00:00:57.300> four<00:00:57.660> six

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
menu that has one two three four six

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.280 
menu that has one two three four six
different<00:00:58.800> options<00:00:59.570> seven<00:01:00.570> clear<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> master

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
different options seven clear the master

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.810 
different options seven clear the master
and<00:01:01.500> each<00:01:01.800> different<00:01:02.160> option<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.360> color

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
and each different option is a color

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
and each different option is a color
selection<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> bottom<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.500> make

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
selection from the bottom down here make

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.570 
selection from the bottom down here make
you<00:01:08.010> select<00:01:08.310> green<00:01:10.070> you're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.370> see

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you select green you're going to see

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.539 
you select green you're going to see
that<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.229> gives<00:01:13.830> isolated<00:01:14.729> area<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.400> we

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that and gives isolated area and if we

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
that and gives isolated area and if we
take<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.940> color<00:01:18.270> draw<00:01:18.630> fern

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
take this color draw fern

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030 
take this color draw fern
and<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.700> select<00:01:22.210> Iberia<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.650> think<00:01:23.890> it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
and we select Iberia you think it's

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.270 
and we select Iberia you think it's
pretty<00:01:24.190> close<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.120> what<00:01:25.480> we<00:01:25.660> want<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.100> can

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
pretty close to what we want then we can

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.170 
pretty close to what we want then we can
start<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.820> use<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:32.010> slider<00:01:33.010> too

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.160 

slowly<00:01:37.990> adjust<00:01:38.590> our<00:01:38.770> colors<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.180> we<00:01:40.750> want<00:01:40.960> to

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
slowly adjust our colors so we want to

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.960 
slowly adjust our colors so we want to
move<00:01:41.680> into<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.460> red<00:01:42.760> area<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:47.880> feel<00:01:48.880> like

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
move into the red area and I feel like

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.910 
move into the red area and I feel like
it's<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.240> little<00:01:49.480> under<00:01:50.110> saturated<00:01:50.620> so<00:01:50.860> I'm

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
it's a little under saturated so I'm

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.970 
it's a little under saturated so I'm
just<00:01:51.010> going<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.220> pump<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.670> up<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:51.880> little<00:01:52.180> bit

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.530 

and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.480 

by<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.140> just<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.710> little<00:02:03.860> bit

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.550 

now<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.240> important<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> realize<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:12.560> we

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
now it's important to realize that we

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
now it's important to realize that we
were<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.250> trying<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.060> into<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
were just trying to get into the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.710 
were just trying to get into the
ballpark<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> slider<00:02:17.880> adjustment

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
ballpark with the slider adjustment

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
ballpark with the slider adjustment
layer<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.710> we'll<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.890> able<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.160> hit<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> home

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
layer like we'll be able to hit a home

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.200 
layer like we'll be able to hit a home
run<00:02:20.580> every<00:02:21.240> time<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.700> nice<00:02:23.910> thing<00:02:24.150> about

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
run every time but the nice thing about

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.740 
run every time but the nice thing about
this<00:02:24.570> tool<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.550> shifts<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.030> colors<00:02:27.390> on

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
this tool is shifts all the colors on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.680 
this tool is shifts all the colors on
the<00:02:28.140> entire<00:02:28.350> document<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:30.270> now<00:02:32.510> you'll<00:02:33.510> notice

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the entire document so now you'll notice

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.960 
the entire document so now you'll notice
that<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.140> sign<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.130> background<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.790> few

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that this sign in the background a few

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.270 
that this sign in the background a few
other<00:02:36.090> things<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.480> changed<00:02:36.840> too<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:38.100> you'll

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
other things have changed too but you'll

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.200 
other things have changed too but you'll
also<00:02:38.430> notice<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:40.370> some<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> color<00:02:41.790> that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
also notice that some of the color that

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.400 
also notice that some of the color that
was<00:02:43.430> being<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:45.390> local<00:02:45.780> color<00:02:45.990> that's<00:02:46.230> being

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
was being the local color that's being

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
was being the local color that's being
affected<00:02:46.920> by<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.160> here<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.580> some<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.700> cat

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
affected by the here and some of the cat

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.020 
affected by the here and some of the cat
shadows<00:02:51.450> aren't<00:02:51.990> being<00:02:52.560> touched<00:02:53.100> we're<00:02:53.910> going

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
shadows aren't being touched we're going

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.730 
shadows aren't being touched we're going
to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> little<00:02:54.720> bit<00:02:54.960> later<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.470> let's

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
to get that a little bit later but let's

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.580 
to get that a little bit later but let's
try<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.250> color<00:02:57.050> correct<00:02:58.050> first<00:02:58.350> so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
try and get the color correct first so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:11.270 
try and get the color correct first so
now<00:02:58.890> I'm<00:02:59.130> gonna<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.580> open<00:02:59.930> up<00:03:00.930> my<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.440> curves

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.080 

and<00:03:11.900> ran<00:03:12.900> into

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.640 

it's<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.180> little<00:03:19.390> too<00:03:19.480> bright<00:03:19.690> let's<00:03:20.320> bring<00:03:20.500> it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650

looking<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.050> this<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.620> pretty<00:04:11.830> cool<00:04:12.100> but

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
looking at this this is pretty cool but

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.270 
looking at this this is pretty cool but
you'll<00:04:12.460> notice<00:04:12.640> that<00:04:12.730> some<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.600> these<00:04:13.660> areas

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
you'll notice that some of these areas

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.949 
you'll notice that some of these areas
on<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.460> side<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.970> haven't<00:04:16.269> been<00:04:16.420> meshed<00:04:16.690> and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
on the side and haven't been meshed and

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.890 
on the side and haven't been meshed and
in<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.340> actual<00:04:20.700> final<00:04:21.700> image<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.480> done<00:04:22.690> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
in the actual final image I have done it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.490 
in the actual final image I have done it
so<00:04:23.350> what<00:04:23.740> was<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.280> difference<00:04:25.050> well<00:04:26.050> part<00:04:26.440> of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so what was the difference well part of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.720 
so what was the difference well part of
that<00:04:26.560> is<00:04:26.710> going<00:04:27.100> back<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.490> hue/saturation

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
that is going back to the hue/saturation

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.710 
that is going back to the hue/saturation
and<00:04:28.740> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:32.370> slider<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.720> understanding

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
and going to slider in understanding

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.340 
and going to slider in understanding
this<00:04:35.130> take<00:04:36.130> this<00:04:36.550> slider<00:04:36.940> is<00:04:37.450> variable<00:04:38.170> and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
this take this slider is variable and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.220 
this take this slider is variable and
you<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.650> open<00:04:39.040> up<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:42.790> can<00:04:42.910> open<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.330> up<00:04:43.540> like

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
you can open up you can open it up like
