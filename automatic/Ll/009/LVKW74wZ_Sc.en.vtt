so in this little video here I want to
check<00:00:03.090> out<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.720> speech<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.890> case<00:00:05.100> here<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
check out the speech in case here the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.450 
check out the speech in case here the
ultra<00:00:06.210> fit<00:00:06.529> for<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> iPhone<00:00:08.040> 5<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.200> 5s

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
ultra fit for the iPhone 5 and the 5s

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.730 
ultra fit for the iPhone 5 and the 5s
it's<00:00:11.460> called<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.849> crystal<00:00:12.300> shell<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.049> ultra<00:00:13.559> fat

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
it's called a crystal shell so ultra fat

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.910 
it's called a crystal shell so ultra fat
crystal<00:00:14.250> shell<00:00:14.460> variant<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> hard

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
crystal shell variant here it's a hard

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
crystal shell variant here it's a hard
case<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:22.939> but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.720> very<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.109> simplistic

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
case so but it's a very very simplistic

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.490 
case so but it's a very very simplistic

camera<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.770> of<00:00:37.770> course<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:38.489> power<00:00:38.760> button

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.229 

power<00:00:44.879> button<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.610> down

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
power button there we go and also down

00:00:48.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
power button there we go and also down
here<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> bottom<00:00:51.170> sweet

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.570 

so<00:01:02.640> let's<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:04.890> box<00:01:05.129> by<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.400> way

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so let's just this is the box by the way

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
so let's just this is the box by the way
that<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.300> ultra<00:01:06.810> Fitz<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that you get it in ultra Fitz and the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
that you get it in ultra Fitz and the
reason<00:01:10.170> why<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.740> five<00:01:10.980> four<00:01:11.130> five

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reason why is they go five four five

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.150 
reason why is they go five four five
minute<00:01:11.580> 5s<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.120> because<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> same

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
minute 5s is because they are the same

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.870 
minute 5s is because they are the same
slice<00:01:16.430> sweet<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> pretty<00:01:20.310> cool<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.729> can

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
slice sweet so pretty cool that you can

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.160 
slice sweet so pretty cool that you can
see<00:01:21.180> through<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:27.000> you're<00:01:27.510> like<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> clicking

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
see through so you're like a clicking

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.270 
see through so you're like a clicking
sound<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.170> there<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.260> go<00:01:31.410> it<00:01:32.040> doesn't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
sound here and there we go it doesn't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
sound here and there we go it doesn't
actually<00:01:32.550> affect<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.420> pain<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.780> phone<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
actually affect how pain the phone is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.760 
actually affect how pain the phone is
that<00:01:34.200> much<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.170> gives<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.500> nice

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that much but it kind of gives a nice

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
that much but it kind of gives a nice
little<00:01:37.950> protection<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> nice

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
little protection you can see a nice

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
little protection you can see a nice
little<00:01:39.150> speech<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.020> logo<00:01:40.410> down<00:01:40.800> here<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.160> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
little speech in logo down here at the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
little speech in logo down here at the
bottom<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.380> pretty

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
bottom and I actually think it's pretty

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.639 
bottom and I actually think it's pretty
nice<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.690> here<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.440> how

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
nice you can see here kind of like how

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
nice you can see here kind of like how
big<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.890> cutout<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.610> yeah<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.330> feel<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> edge

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
big the cutout is yeah you feel the edge

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.670 
big the cutout is yeah you feel the edge
a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.290> bit<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.570> overall<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.290> say<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
a little bit but overall would say it's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
a little bit but overall would say it's
very<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.250> good<00:01:59.450> doesn't<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.720> add<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
very very good doesn't really add that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.960 
very very good doesn't really add that
much<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.590> definitely<00:02:01.740> adds<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.369> nice<00:02:02.610> little

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970

protection there as you can see here on

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.930 
protection there as you can see here on
the<00:02:06.240> front<00:02:06.390> sighs<00:02:06.750> well<00:02:07.490> kind<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.729> that
