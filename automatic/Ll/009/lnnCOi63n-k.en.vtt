 breeding for six years 50 years the beta 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.470
 badly stands out from the female of these

 15 to 30 liters heat filter and 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:21.570
 illuminated so as to plant the beta 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.670
 enjoyed the hd rica shadow or the

 aquarium water regularly for 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.650
 avoid parameter errors the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.870
 beta reproduction is enough 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.570
 particular the badly built a nest of

 the known record is about 1000 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.240
 after 36 hours the first games and 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 klose leaving hanging on the surface 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.940
 the fry that will swim only after
