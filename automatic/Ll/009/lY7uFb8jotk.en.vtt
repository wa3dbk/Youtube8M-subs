the intelligent glass will stiffen up

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.280 
the intelligent glass will stiffen up
and<00:02:24.470> make<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.980> board<00:02:25.280> more<00:02:26.140> responsive<00:02:27.140> at

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
and make the board more responsive at

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.410 
and make the board more responsive at
higher<00:02:27.500> speeds<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.220> at<00:02:28.430> slower<00:02:28.670> speeds<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
fiber glass will actually soften up just

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.699 
fiber glass will actually soften up just
a<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:31.880> bit<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.120> well<00:02:32.560> there's<00:02:33.560> not<00:02:33.680> very

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
many laminates in the line when it comes

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.380 
many laminates in the line when it comes

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.039 
to carbon or Kevlar however the a K
again<00:02:39.080> has<00:02:39.519> what's<00:02:40.519> called<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.880> cross<00:02:41.360> carbon

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
again has what's called a cross carbon

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.170 
again has what's called a cross carbon
which<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.350> from<00:02:43.069> one<00:02:43.310> effective<00:02:43.700> edges<00:02:43.970> rail

through<00:03:25.040> have<00:03:25.820> gone<00:03:26.030> through<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.269> process

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
through have gone through a process

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.880 
through have gone through a process
called<00:03:26.720> slick<00:03:27.590> grind<00:03:28.100> or<00:03:28.459> slick<00:03:29.030> ground<00:03:29.890> some

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
called slick grind or slick ground some

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.650 
called slick grind or slick ground some
of<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> base<00:03:31.190> models<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.880> intermediate

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
times and the high-end models like the a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420 
times and the high-end models like the a
K<00:03:38.359> has<00:03:38.510> been<00:03:38.690> ground<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.079> 35<00:03:39.680> times<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.160> know<00:03:40.220> in

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
K has been ground the 35 times I know in

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.849 
K has been ground the 35 times I know in
the<00:03:40.519> 8k<00:03:40.880> video<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.269> said<00:03:41.569> I<00:03:41.750> think<00:03:41.900> 25<00:03:42.620> times

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
the 8k video I said I think 25 times

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.160 
the 8k video I said I think 25 times
it's<00:03:43.040> actually<00:03:43.190> 35<00:03:43.850> times<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.840> if<00:03:45.049> you're

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
it's actually 35 times so if you're

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.800 
it's actually 35 times so if you're
looking<00:03:45.410> for<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.910> good<00:03:46.910> board<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.450> does<00:03:47.690> it

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
looking for a good board that does it

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.530 
looking for a good board that does it
all<00:03:47.959> or<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.319> series<00:03:49.220> of<00:03:49.250> boards<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:50.090> can<00:03:50.269> do<00:03:50.420> it

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540
