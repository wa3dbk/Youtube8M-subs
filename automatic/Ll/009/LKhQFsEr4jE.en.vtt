like<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:04.190> said<00:06:04.430> one<00:06:04.639> of<00:06:04.760> those<00:06:04.880> things<00:06:05.290> it

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
like I said one of those things it

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.520 
like I said one of those things it
doesn't<00:06:07.660> it's<00:06:08.660> not<00:06:08.840> really<00:06:09.320> big<00:06:10.300> but<00:06:11.300> it's<00:06:11.660> you

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
doesn't it's not really big but it's you

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.770 
doesn't it's not really big but it's you
know<00:06:12.560> just<00:06:12.889> a<00:06:13.040> small<00:06:13.430> thing<00:06:13.460> so<00:06:14.000> small<00:06:14.270> detail

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
know just a small thing so small detail

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.710 
know just a small thing so small detail
and<00:06:15.760> it<00:06:16.760> can<00:06:16.940> really<00:06:17.120> make<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.419> difference

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
and it can really make a difference

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.879 
and it can really make a difference
sometimes<00:06:18.350> you<00:06:18.710> know<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:20.590> is<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.620> big

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
sometimes you know it is a big

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.420 
sometimes you know it is a big
difference<00:06:22.130> i<00:06:22.460> guess<00:06:22.639> in<00:06:23.150> small<00:06:23.810> thing<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.080> do

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430
