00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
finally once the digital actress

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.459 
finally once the digital actress
performs<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.969> looks<00:02:46.209> exactly<00:02:46.569> like<00:02:46.780> herself

they<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.129> discard<00:02:48.609> all<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:48.969> footage

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
they then discard all of this footage

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.379 
they then discard all of this footage
and<00:02:49.480> retarget<00:02:50.469> back<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.700> smaller<00:02:51.969> pixie

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
and retarget back to the smaller pixie

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.149 
and retarget back to the smaller pixie
version<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.959> then<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.739> course<00:02:53.980> they

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
version and then of course they

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.879 
version and then of course they
re-render<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:54.879> all<00:02:55.090> over<00:02:55.599> again<00:02:55.889> the

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
re-render it all over again the

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.470 
re-render it all over again the
advantage<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.519> approach<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.299> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
advantage of this approach is that the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.539 
advantage of this approach is that the
director<00:02:58.989> wants<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.469> change<00:02:59.980> for<00:03:00.159> example<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
director wants to change for example the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.490 
director wants to change for example the
proportions<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.329> smaller<00:03:01.599> pixie<00:03:02.049> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
proportions of the smaller pixie the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.559 
proportions of the smaller pixie the
team<00:03:02.769> just<00:03:03.010> has<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.340> retarget<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.090> then

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
team just has to retarget and then

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.050 
team just has to retarget and then
re-render<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.919> I<00:03:05.980> had<00:03:06.129> a<00:03:06.159> second<00:03:06.669> huge

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
re-render and I had a second huge

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.909 
re-render and I had a second huge
benefit<00:03:07.569> of<00:03:07.750> allowing<00:03:07.900> one<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.379> examine

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
benefit of allowing one to examine

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.459 
benefit of allowing one to examine
everything<00:03:09.340> stage<00:03:09.879> by<00:03:10.150> stage<00:03:10.180> as<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:11.169> it<00:03:11.290> was<00:03:11.439> a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:11.469 
everything stage by stage as if it was a

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.559 
everything stage by stage as if it was a
final<00:03:11.769> shot<00:03:11.919> to<00:03:12.730> hunt<00:03:12.969> down<00:03:13.120> anything<00:03:13.419> that

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
final shot to hunt down anything that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.390

maybe<00:03:13.810> didn't<00:03:14.079> look<00:03:14.169> right<00:03:14.349> for<00:03:14.919> example<00:03:15.010> they

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
maybe didn't look right for example they

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.059 
maybe didn't look right for example they
could<00:03:15.459> focus<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:16.269> on<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.689> eyes<00:03:16.810> or<00:03:17.769> maybe

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
could focus just on the eyes or maybe

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.250 
could focus just on the eyes or maybe
focus<00:03:18.519> just<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:18.879> how<00:03:19.090> blood<00:03:19.480> flowed<00:03:19.810> around
