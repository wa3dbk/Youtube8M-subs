00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
garden but I find that they're sharp

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 
garden but I find that they're sharp
enough<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> nice<00:00:54.570> clean<00:00:54.840> score<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
enough to get a nice clean score all the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
enough to get a nice clean score all the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
way around so I just want to find the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260 
way around so I just want to find the
middle<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.890> chopstick<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.789> think

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
middle point of the chopstick I think

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.990 
middle point of the chopstick I think
it's<00:01:00.420> about<00:01:00.539> right<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.550> score<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.840> twist<00:01:03.840> it
