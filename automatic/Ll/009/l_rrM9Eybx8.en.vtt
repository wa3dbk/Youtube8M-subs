00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
about three weeks now this is probably

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.589 
about three weeks now this is probably
the<00:02:17.540> sixth<00:02:18.540> time<00:02:18.720> I've<00:02:18.900> use<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:20.599> first

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
the sixth time I've use it but first

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.850 
the sixth time I've use it but first
impressions<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:22.530> basically<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
impressions on it basically it are that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.509 
impressions on it basically it are that
to<00:02:25.860> me<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.430> smells<00:02:26.670> funny<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.950> can't<00:02:29.280> get

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
to me it smells funny and I can't get

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.390 
to me it smells funny and I can't get
used<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.260> I'm<00:02:31.260> basically<00:02:31.709> just<00:02:31.860> using<00:02:32.220> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
used to it I'm basically just using it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000 
used to it I'm basically just using it
up<00:02:32.489> because<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.780> fresh<00:02:33.989> face<00:02:34.200> mask<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
up because it's a fresh face mask and it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.170 
up because it's a fresh face mask and it
has<00:02:35.190> 30<00:02:35.580> days<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.840> expires<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:38.610> smells

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
has 30 days to expires and it smells

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.210 
has 30 days to expires and it smells
weird<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.110> think<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.709> because<00:02:41.190> of

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
weird because I think it's because of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.479 
weird because I think it's because of
the<00:02:41.370> papaya<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.290> also<00:02:43.290> think<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> smells<00:02:44.159> weird

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
the papaya I also think it smells weird

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.390 
the papaya I also think it smells weird
because<00:02:44.870> after<00:02:45.870> reading<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.620> ingredients

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
because after reading the ingredients

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.830 
because after reading the ingredients
it<00:02:48.379> smells<00:02:49.379> like<00:02:50.040> just<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.910> mixture<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.660> like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it smells like just a mixture of like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.180 
it smells like just a mixture of like
foods<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:53.629> nah<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.989> don't<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.920> say<00:02:56.069> it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
foods like nah I don't want to say it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.069 
foods like nah I don't want to say it
smells<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.549> rotten<00:02:57.030> foods<00:02:57.359> but<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.810> smells

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
smells like rotten foods but it smells

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.900 
smells like rotten foods but it smells
just<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.470> mixture<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> foods<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.730> just

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
just like a mixture of foods and it just

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.140 
just like a mixture of foods and it just
reminds<00:03:00.359> me<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.510> garbage<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.609> don't<00:03:02.609> want<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
I'm gonna wash it off in a few because

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.479 
I'm gonna wash it off in a few because
it's<00:03:22.560> been<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.799> for<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:23.069> little<00:03:23.190> bit<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.260> I

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
it's been on for a little bit but I

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.539 
it's been on for a little bit but I
wanted<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.549> talk<00:03:27.060> about<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.419> while<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:28.549> it

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
wanted to talk about it while it's on it

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.890 
wanted to talk about it while it's on it
feels<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:31.169> fresh<00:03:31.609> it's<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.750> only

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
feels really fresh it's just the only

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.330 
feels really fresh it's just the only
thing<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.260> gets<00:03:34.410> me<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.680> smell<00:03:35.040> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
thing that gets me is the smell and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.580 
thing that gets me is the smell and
that's<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.239> only<00:03:36.599> reason<00:03:36.900> why<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.049> don't<00:03:37.260> like

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
that's the only reason why I don't like

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.240 
that's the only reason why I don't like
it's<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.700> much<00:03:38.970> compared<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.660> everything<00:03:39.870> else

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
it's so much compared to everything else

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.289 
it's so much compared to everything else
you'd<00:03:41.250> think<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.760> papaya<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
you'd think like the papaya and

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.289 
you'd think like the papaya and
everything<00:03:43.109> would<00:03:43.290> smell<00:03:43.639> decent<00:03:44.639> but<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
everything would smell decent but I

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.860 
everything would smell decent but I
don't<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.769> smells<00:03:47.040> funny<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.639> me<00:03:47.870> I
