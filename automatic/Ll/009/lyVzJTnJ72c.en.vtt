little<00:01:18.420> flaw<00:01:18.689> would<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
little flaw would be how you can kind of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249

see even when this is securely on as

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
see even when this is securely on as
good<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> little

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
good as it can get you can see a little

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060

skin<00:01:24.240> between<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> Cape<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:25.950> also

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
skin between the Cape but it could also

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
skin between the Cape but it could also
be<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.490> Cape<00:01:26.670> flapping<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.540> because

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
be the Cape flapping over because

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.380 
be the Cape flapping over because
