00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.420
 but if the amount is incredible and if 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.420
 some deposits 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.730
 and it's already 90 minutes of time and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.470
 start the spontaneous partners to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.940
 make theirs and the hand of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.310
 rest because this one is going to sleep in the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.349
 rest boat worth it so 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 less would cause what happened when 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.710
 reaches contract but if it continues 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.899
 prepared 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.700
 and when they enter this spontaneous type 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.280
 one supposes that they go with the best 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 intention to just greet the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.840
 puma player 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.490
 Well, this is not good in the field 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.350
 and you have to finish the game like that 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.930
 It has to end 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 they are pure doctors see them not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 of chivas but it seems to be between 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 amateurs from america if you give the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 Print 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 and the saddest thing is that we see over there 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.159
 also the ladies to the children 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.540
 scared 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.909
 the criterion the criterion appealed to 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.650
 regulation and did not allow them to return to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210
 get in 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.700
 and did not allow them to re-enter 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.640
 footballers here and if it comes into play the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.680
 criterion 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.520
 the same success although the tribune 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.360
 cover 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.200
 the parliament is over 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.200
 here yes clear 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.510
 because in the end the regulation time 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510
 are fulfilled 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.709
 it was never noticed that the referee gave the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.630
 final whistle but you will see invasion of 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.459
 court and this can subtract up 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.080
 dangerous so the people of america and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.990
 of guarrate you do not have to start putting 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 speed to the matter because my countrymen 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.950
 there was in las vegas 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 galindo and surely did the same thing 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 you comment that Ricardo PelÃ¡ez did in the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 rap surely came over to offer 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.640
 an apology for that situation that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.770
 it was presented in the classic aquivaldo as 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.870
 calmly and he began to give autographs 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.519
 we're trapped gentlemen ended 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.739
 preparation party in las vegas de 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.340
