celebrate<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.000> this<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:05.180> think<00:01:06.560> at<00:01:07.560> these

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
celebrate with this I think at these

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.910 
celebrate with this I think at these
edges<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.580> year<00:01:09.360> after<00:01:09.780> year<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
edges here year after year and you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.480 
edges here year after year and you
analyze<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.920> Ryan<00:01:14.280> Giggs

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
analyze the way they they go Ryan Giggs

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
analyze the way they they go Ryan Giggs
Amin<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> 40<00:01:20.659> no<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:22.200> four<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.890> forest<00:01:23.280> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
Amin in 40 no the top four is forest to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.840 
Amin in 40 no the top four is forest to
lose<00:01:23.630> because<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.310> certain<00:01:26.310> points<00:01:26.670> from

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
lose because now certain points from

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.679 
lose because now certain points from
from<00:01:27.360> Tottenham<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.329> 1516<00:01:30.329> from

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
from Tottenham and I think 1516 from

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.590 
from Tottenham and I think 1516 from
menu<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> evident<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> game<00:01:33.360> could

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
menu and and evident this game could

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 
menu and and evident this game could
reduce<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> distance<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> fifth<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
reduce the distance to the fifth to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
reduce the distance to the fifth to
seven<00:01:36.990> points<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> seven<00:01:37.890> points<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.340> nine

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
seven points and seven points with nine

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.359 
seven points and seven points with nine
matches<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.689> never<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:41.040> these<00:01:41.189> moments

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
matches you never know in these moments

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
matches you never know in these moments
certain<00:01:41.820> points<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.409> believe

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
certain points I really don't believe

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.889 
certain points I really don't believe
that<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.310> lose<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.899> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that we are going to lose that that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
that we are going to lose that that
distance<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.500> objective<00:01:47.130> number<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.600> top

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
distance so objective number one top

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
distance so objective number one top
four<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.799> our<00:01:49.920> pocket<00:01:50.149> unless<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.360> lose<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
four is in our pocket unless we lose it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
four is in our pocket unless we lose it
and<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.829> let's<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.460> objective<00:01:53.909> number

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and now let's go for objective number

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.609 
and now let's go for objective number
two<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.110> top<00:01:55.890> three<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.610> give

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
two which is top three that give

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.000 
two which is top three that give
champions<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> direct<00:01:59.070> qualification

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010
