00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi girls so today we 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.779
 let's go off so talk about due the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.210
 reading the decryption gift of products 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.300
 so there body hair care or 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.969
 other so here I took during an axis 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.800
 so the typical commercial product is 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.140
 disgusting so we got a little bit 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.850
 the base decrypt so the most important 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 so ingredients that are beggars 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.769
 we have for example the bases before 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 who are aggressive so all that is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.210
 east cs and so let a monk yom 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.210
 lauryl sulfate sodium lauryl sulfate 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.910
 sodium laureth sulfate we have them 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 peg the ppg so that are solvents 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.390
 we also have propylene 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 glycol that are derivatives 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.680
 petrochemicals so per year during 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.850
 things a little basic so some 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 ingredients found in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 most of our products 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.710
 so there are some who are a bit 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.289
 concealed or known a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 little bit less and so suddenly that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 poses a little problem so I'll get you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.949
 propose a solution very very 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 so easy to decrypt your cosmetics 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.159
 so the problem is that either you have to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.659
 so you copy the ingredients 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.280
 all ingredients or ingredients 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 that you do not know or that you 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 suspect where you buy the product and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.189
 you check incoming but the problem 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 is that if you check it in 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.220
 coming in and you find stuff 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.090
 disgusting had maybe not 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 want to use it 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 so unfortunately we can not 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 do a lot so I'm going when 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.100
 even give you a solution that is 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.810
 nice enough but who is not 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 necessarily two months but that I you 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.140
 strongly recommend 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.659
 so this is the site the truth about 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.740
 cosmetics point fr to point as I 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 do not know anymore so I'll put you the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
 link underneath the video that shows you 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.930
 is very interesting and I'm going to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 explain a little bit the use of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.240
 this site which will seem to you a little 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 little difficult so there are a lot of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.490
 girls who will ask precisely 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 how to decrypt our 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.020
 products and this site is not very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 easy by the way in the beginning I have not everything 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 right away understood how to use it so 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.630
 I will explain a little bit 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.969
 how's this going on 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.619
 so if you can so at the same time 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.299
 as you listen to the video consult the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.110
 site directly so typed into the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.229
 google search 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 the truth about cosmetics you're going 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.150
 so click on the first link that will 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.920
 appear 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.990
 and you're going to have a page so of 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.460
 turquoise blue color on which will 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.410
 be written on top of the truth about 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.990
 the cosmetics and underneath you have 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.390
 a little baron with writing remarks 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.080
 and contact suggestions and everything to the right 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.670
 you will find the search and nc 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.570
 so you're going to click on that so 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.370
 famous on this famous link so then 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.340
 you will have a little explanation 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.860
 with 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.269
 how do you explain a little bit so 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.959
 you clicked on now this is 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.360
 gone as we start our search 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.800
 so then you will be able to put 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.510
 so the name of your product so I 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.290
 a big box at the top but it's 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.300
 optional 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.680
 if you want to put it you put so 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.330
 you do not put it's not a problem 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.129
 it really does not worry 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.680
 then below you will see a 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.690
 other little box so with looking at 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.840
 side and we will ask you to put 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.459
 the letters of the code insee is there you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.170
 tell me what's this thing that I 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.030
 do not know what it is because it wants 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 to say what's the use or what is 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.290
 so at first I thought it was 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.470
 bar code word or something in the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.209
 kind 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.370
 because the code for me was with 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.190
 numbers at the base but not in fact 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.290
 it's the ingredients code so by 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.299
 example here in this super product axis 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.519
 who is not mine you can you 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.660
 still doubt we find the cua so 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.970
 what we know very well is that it's 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.769
 water so sodium laureth sulfate donate 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.879
 which is the basis the sale that is when 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.489
 even pretty aggressive 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.670
 sodium chloride is quite 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.160
 passable the perfume obviously we had some 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.019
 cock hamid apparently likes that i know 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.459
 not at all for example here if I want 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.720
 to go see I must have consulted 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.829
 for the cock hamid moldau dextrine I 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.069
 do not know at all what it is either 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.239
 so if I see the product in store I 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.299
 do not want to know what it is I'm not going 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.560
 know if it's good or bad ppg ben 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.000
 it's very good that it was a solvent 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.709
 which is very very bad so in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.620
 general you have it with the figure to 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.549
 side so not replace the pulled ppg 12 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.519
 oh you have 6 7 8 9 what you want 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.310
 citric acid is good sodium menzo 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.590
 ate well lemony lol geraniol 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.849
 limonest linalool so these are 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.919
 essential oils and we have 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.150
 the smell so the scent of caramel that 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.130
 is in this product 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.220
 so before starting the search 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.720
 so know that it's done under 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.639
 shaped smiley so when you go 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.810
 search for your product you have to have 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.260
 a list so 2 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.060
 of all the names so we can find 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.910
 in products with on the side of 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.190
 smileys so know that three smiley that 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.100
 smile it's very good smiley who 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.570
 smiles it's a neutral smiley with 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.419
 a bar satisfying a sad smiley 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.590
 passable sad smiley insufficient and 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.169
 three sad and downright 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.669
 advisors so for example in your 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.350
 search you I do not know what you 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.360
 have in your product 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.419
 but let's admit that like me you have 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.910
 you have sodium laureth sulfate so 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.070
 search for imei code so in the 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.360
 little box so where you sought to 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.790
 side you go ms 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.830
 od so these are the first three 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.139
 code letters imei so s 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.720
 od you are going to do search where you 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.160
 will fall back on a list that is 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.660
 precisely he will start with all 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.610
 hes so soon as we can find in 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.030
 our products and you are going to search 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.110
 sodium laureth sulfate so you go 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.790
 see down is by order 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.880
 alphabetically and you have finally found 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.130
 your product with the smiley head 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 so I know more about which he and I 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.030
 know more if it's if it's a man 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.950
 sad or gaming it's all over and at 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.640
 side you will be able so selected 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.770
 the ingredient so add this night nc 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.940
 y so that will allow you to establish the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.340
 list of all your ingredients 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.639
 that you have or if you are interested 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.789
 no 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.219
 to find out more for example about what 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.419
 you have m you have selected it 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.449
 see a little explanation 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.219
 sorry for avast you're going to have a 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.319
 little explanation with one side 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.539
 the origin of the product so 6 and vegetable 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.699
 synthetic or chemical and next to a 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.680
 little note if there is really something 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.389
 who's not going or something like that or 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.560
 if you do not care more than that 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.210
 it's just the smiley that you 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.979
 interest you will be able to go up 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.020
 at the very top of your list and make a 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.490
 other research so every time 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.889
 put the first three letters so 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.139
 of your ingredients that is in your 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.659
 product therefore by cons as many times it goes 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.900
 be possible that the site does not find 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.580
 so what I advise you these 2 2 I 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.110
 do not know if there is a mail system or 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.389
 message and to just send the 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.650
 product that you have the component 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.990
 you have found in your product 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.340
 so that it can be added so to the 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.439
 list of this site which is really 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.659
 awesome so that would be good so 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:53.849
 to make it evolve a little bit so 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:56.490
 it's really the site that I am 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.360
 recommend so much for your 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.419
 product research 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.830
 so obviously not everyone has 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.779
 internet on his phone everyone 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.319
 can not look from his 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:06.719
 phone 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.939
 so what I advise you is 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:11.639
 to really select the products 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.529
 who you suspect or something 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.750
 like that to go home from 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:17.339
 check and then buy because if 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.930
 you buy you checked after you 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:22.339
 risk being disappointed is precisely not to 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.310
 not use the product or provide them 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:27.870
 so that's why that product is going 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.339
 also help you memorize so 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.279
 products that are not top 

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:35.009
 what will make you a pro so the 

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:36.599
 decryption product so actually 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.009
 I'm not pro in quotation marks 

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.629
 because it's true that there are tricks 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.969
 in which I block for example 

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:43.590
 on this product but really it is so 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:45.090
 I recommend you 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.260
 strongly because it's really 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.410
 something that will help you 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.720
 evolve in the natural way so without you 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.930
 to be fooled obviously so I hope 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.830

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:01.260
