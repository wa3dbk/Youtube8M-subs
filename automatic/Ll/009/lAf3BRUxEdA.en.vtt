00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
don't know go away so I mean a lake it

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.670 
don't know go away so I mean a lake it
would<00:02:19.300> be<00:02:19.390> okay<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> river<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.560> it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
would be okay but this is a river so it

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100 
would be okay but this is a river so it
can<00:02:20.860> wash<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.850> way<00:02:21.940> I'm<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:22.480> gonna<00:02:22.780> kind<00:02:23.050> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
can wash the way I'm just gonna kind of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.449 
can wash the way I'm just gonna kind of
put<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.470> between<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.920> rock<00:02:24.100> here<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
put it in between the rock here the

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.910 
put it in between the rock here the
string<00:02:24.959> I'll<00:02:25.959> probably<00:02:26.110> put<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.380> bigger<00:02:26.680> lock

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
string I'll probably put a bigger lock

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.040 
string I'll probably put a bigger lock
on<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.190> after<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:27.700> okay<00:02:28.420> come<00:02:28.750> back<00:02:28.900> tomorrow
