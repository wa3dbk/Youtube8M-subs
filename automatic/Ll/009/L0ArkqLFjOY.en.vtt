00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 the idea for today's video came to me 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.580
 following this comment to mine 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 previous episode use the green screen 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 it's the idea that immediately springs to mind 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.500
 wants to create a small studio but you're 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 sure it's the right choice 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.170
 today we see three reasons for not 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.170
 use it 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.060
 hi i'm paolo and today we see three 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.540
 reasons not to use the green 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.120
 screen 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.680
 first of all what it is if you've ever seen it 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.600
 a presenter on television or on 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.280
 internet with graphics behind 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.410
 you will probably have asked yourself how 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.970
 gets with the effect to make it happen yes 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.550
 use backgrounds with some 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.200
 shades of green every now and then that blue 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.910
 then they can be easily removed and 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.830
 computer once the subject is 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.480
 been separated from the background always at 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.820
 computer you can insert graphics 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.100
 both static and animated of course 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.780
 having said that the risks involved e 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.420
 because in which situations it is better not 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.250
 use it first reason the format to which 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.590
 record your video camera use a 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.399
 semi-professional model a reflex o 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.440
 a smartphone 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.509
 you must know that the file recorded on 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.640
 memory cards are very compressed 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.869
 the compression needed both to do 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.149
 so that the video camera can 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.410
 write all the data on the card either 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.880
 to ensure that these do not occur 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.399
 filling too fast doing 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.750
 visit them for a few minutes 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.340
 compression characterized by a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.410
 significant loss of information 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.580
 related to colors this why 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.979
 the human eye is much more sensitive 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 on the gray scale so if during the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.130
 compression a lot of data related to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.600
 colors are lost we do not notice 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.369
 too obvious 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.560
 but this is a problem when we go 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.060
 to remove the truth from the image seen 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.650
 which is precisely the color information 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.080
 have been sacrificed at the time of 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.670
 compression and writing on the ticket 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.750
 we will have computer problems when it is time 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.580
 to remove the background 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 if you've ever tried to 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.670
 remove the green from an image 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 containing a subject with lots of hair 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.170
 maybe curly knows what I'm talking about 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.060
 in the areas between the subject is the background 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.159
 we will have big problems separating it 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.960
 the ideal would be to have a video camera 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.060
 with another resolution especially with 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.150
 a codec that is not the h 264 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.340
 but for example the prores hq second 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.220
 reason lighting must be 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 perfect too curious as i 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.820
 neophytes are those who want to use 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.890
 this technique when it is notoriously 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.720
 very difficult to avoid big 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.340
 computer problems and headaches in 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470
 followed the lighting must be 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.700
 perfect this means that the background 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.680
 it must be illuminated in a manner 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.180
 uniform and subject must be well 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.489
 distant to avoid strange reflections 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 green on the face and body 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.730
 so this is a small study 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.560
 could be one more reason not to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.630
 use it last reason 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 this may seem trivial but often me 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.140
 they ask if it is possible to remove it 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.030
 background and put 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.069
 white or black the obvious question then 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.720
 it is but why not use one directly 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.550
 white or black will be easier 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.470
 the lighting and most likely there 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.280
 we will save great headaches in post 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.630
 production 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.250
 ok you said all this can very well 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.330
 it happens that a professional succeeds in 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.730
 get this effect with one 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 mediocre camera or maybe one 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.450
 in the beginning he manages to have a result 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 acceptable in my opinion though if you stay 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.430
 learning and maybe creating yours 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.260
 study 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.880
 perhaps it is better to start with situations 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.989
 simpler before venturing with the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.640
 green screen 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.870
 I hope I have been useful as always 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.790
