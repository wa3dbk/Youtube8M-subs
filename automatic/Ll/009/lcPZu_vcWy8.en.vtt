00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
go ok here is the now the end days this

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.940 
go ok here is the now the end days this
is<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> tone<00:01:01.350> control<00:01:01.800> there

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.100 

oh<00:01:07.079> yeah

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 

this<00:01:13.680> was<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.270> switch

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this was some sort of the switch

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
this was some sort of the switch
selector<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.620> I'm<00:01:16.950> hoping<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
selector there I'm hoping see that is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.530 
selector there I'm hoping see that is
sort<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:19.700> type<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.730> tone<00:01:21.060> circus

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.260 

only<00:01:30.350> had<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:30.770> pickup<00:01:31.250> they<00:01:31.610> have<00:01:31.820> with<00:01:32.030> some

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
only had one pickup they have with some

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.660 
only had one pickup they have with some
little<00:01:32.770> capacitors<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:33.980> stuff<00:01:34.220> in<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.490> back

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
little capacitors and stuff in the back

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.050 
little capacitors and stuff in the back
here<00:01:34.970> underneath<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.540> wiring<00:01:35.950> that

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
here underneath this wiring that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
here underneath this wiring that
supposed<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.300> done<00:01:38.780> something<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:02:10.660 

middle<00:01:48.950> position<00:01:49.430> for<00:01:49.670> my<00:01:49.850> ears<00:01:50.060> out<00:01:50.210> sounds

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.390 

you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:27.090 
you
you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.080 

you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.920 

you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.860 

that's<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.230> middle<00:02:37.530> tier<00:02:37.770> X<00:02:38.069> delay<00:02:38.690> here's<00:02:39.690> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that's the middle tier X delay here's a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.000 
that's the middle tier X delay here's a
little<00:02:40.560> bit<00:02:40.680> what's<00:02:40.860> overdrive<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.620> kinda

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
little bit what's overdrive so you kinda

00:02:44.010 --> 00:03:59.980 
little bit what's overdrive so you kinda
can<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:44.370> some<00:02:44.640> gnarly<00:02:45.209> stuff

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.520 

that<00:04:00.990> was<00:04:01.170> even<00:04:01.320> with<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.770> way<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.130> think

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:16.530 

Springer<00:04:05.310> guitar

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.580 

you

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.700 

so<00:04:22.590> you've<00:04:23.430> got<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.820> nice<00:04:24.090> masonite<00:04:24.990> top

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
so you've got this nice masonite top

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.880 
so you've got this nice masonite top
here<00:04:26.480> Komal<00:04:27.480> tone-tone<00:04:28.790> would<00:04:29.790> Mason<00:04:30.150> night

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
here Komal tone-tone would Mason night

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:52.850 
here Komal tone-tone would Mason night
yeah<00:04:31.890> Tom<00:04:32.670> would<00:04:32.940> Mason<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:36.050> place<00:04:37.050> pretty<00:04:37.380> good

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:12.180 

you

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.620 

no<00:05:13.190> more<00:05:13.430> delay<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.730> like<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.270> delay

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
no more delay I like this delay

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:47.170 
no more delay I like this delay
ecclestone

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.170 

that<00:05:48.139> seemed<00:05:48.500> like<00:05:48.680> as<00:05:49.100> much<00:05:49.370> when<00:05:49.699> this<00:05:49.850> is<00:05:50.030> in

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
that seemed like as much when this is in

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.680 
that seemed like as much when this is in
the<00:05:50.300> middle<00:05:50.449> position<00:05:51.020> of<00:05:51.139> this<00:05:51.289> tongue<00:05:52.690> that

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
the middle position of this tongue that

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.420 
the middle position of this tongue that
figure<00:05:54.199> out<00:05:54.289> how<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.500> works<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.160> put<00:05:55.310> this

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
figure out how that works and put this

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:06.559 
figure out how that works and put this
down<00:05:55.639> yes

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.370 

you

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:34.390 

you

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.090 

so<00:06:35.400> there<00:06:35.820> you<00:06:35.910> have<00:06:35.970> it<00:06:36.950> danelectro<00:06:38.180> 1961<00:06:39.180> a

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
so there you have it danelectro 1961 a

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.150 
so there you have it danelectro 1961 a
yield<00:06:41.100> one<00:06:41.960> silvertone<00:06:42.960> should<00:06:43.590> sit<00:06:43.800> silver

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
yield one silvertone should sit silver

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.130 
yield one silvertone should sit silver
down<00:06:44.340> all<00:06:45.180> right<00:06:45.530> thank<00:06:46.530> you<00:06:46.590> Jason
