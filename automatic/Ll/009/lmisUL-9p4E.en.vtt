00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.529
 the initiative on whether to promote more cohesion on our streets 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 meanwhile, the internet site of Ford Motor is no there there 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.669
 other little tips to the professional driver qualification and also 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.939
 small training films for a better way of dealing with the driver's everyday life 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.680
 first part is the big waste container we will use this 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 to handle the vehicle at the computer 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.610
 To look it all off is not okay that is 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.720
 extreme important 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.180
 because there are many at WKW percent 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.970
 Damage or and even accidents governments did not perform correctly 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.330
 or not made before the truck driver has to start on his tour 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.590
 He first insert the driver card to prove that he also has a 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.510
 Departure control has made 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 It is important that the chip can be read by the device 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.760
 Spaenle are happy 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.040
 Bielefeld-Mitte the controller 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.730
 the boy had already planned 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.400
 the coolant has been recovered 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.110
 the perpetrators do not matter 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 is advocated 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450
 for Klopp would be 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.840
 has participated 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.430
 In the meantime, new school issues can be answered by parents and teachers 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.180
 called in and members 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 One should take this opportunity but soon on again 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.909
 Lucid fuel is also enough in the tank 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 now the drivers come documents 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.900
 this thing must have board again 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 that is the driver a turn acceleration 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.520
 the post will be justified 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.730
 the damage insurance certificate must also for the respective foreign country 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.480
 where the driver makes his virtues the appropriate papers will be on board 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.940
 as the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.680
 which the license for example 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 the documents are clear and clean there are fewer problems with 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.610
 authorities 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 it also does not harm the instructions for use of all devices 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.530
 Truck drivers, for example, had a breakdown with Alfred 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.650
 ready some 36 years of professional life 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.939
 Winter Siegfried in return who the training measures are not all four 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.470
 year old 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.300
 We will also point out that the IMF is in a lot of things 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.879
 to laugh have always been to dock 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.989
 and I also try to make it as accurate and as good as possible 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.859
 Especially in road safety numbers must pay 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.109
 that one has to just make the project will be a buckle Marnette after 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.839
 Buchloe by and large the big important things that's possible 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.789
 and blood and blood when you constantly do what you want us to do 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.180
 This is especially true for the tire the profile that the limit of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.090
 1 comma not less than 6 millimeters 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.060
 Stones must be removed and the wheel nuts must be tight 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.420
 Drivers streaks on the rim or around the wheel nuts can fix these 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.160
 if necessary, be relaxed on the occasion you look under the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.769
 Vehicle if there are people under then in any case the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.200
 Checking the function of the lighting system It is also important for the semi-trailer that the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.030
 Planner is properly lashed storage compartments should be decent 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.490
 closed and secured a material rank is percent 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.660
 what about Smart Reha percent by a fifth of their housing estate 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.919
 perform 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.619
 in one side and thus prepare material for it will 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.669
 Above all, having fun and material is only fair if there is order 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.809
 on the other hand, the corresponding cards are already there 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.839
 and per Germany the OTZ words anti-slip mats are very important to too 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.540
 to make the speaking friction coefficient but also to achieve the same passion 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.069
 the driver must make sure that the cargo 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.059
 properly secured is exciting parents may not be so on the 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.189
 Loading area lie 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.900
 best a trailer on the rest of the tour on plain tires and he 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.089
 has modern look 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:06.289
 Also, see if all attachments are fixed and secured at departure 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.209
 Controllers are all important points 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.609
 especially for me but the lock step Fehmel 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.779
 if not I will pay attention 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.659
 and in the worst case, losing the trailer could have devastating consequences 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.909
 to lead with it and therefore one should pay attention to these things for 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.539
 At the end the semi-trailer will be checked 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.349
 Plug connection to the antilock system for power supply and so air pressure 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.250
 The brake system must be properly inserted 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.340
 at the air pressure brake system that the red connection never alone 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.610
 be connected 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.340
 Also the king's time Fend important one prevailed 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.550
 So we Nico Kunkel error from Federer 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.050
 because the effect on the 11th 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.219
 As a precaution we do a brake test to be sure 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.520
 that fits as seen on the Secret of Rock &amp; Roll should look like this 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.849
 The most important points have become clear 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.750
 in front of their system to brake test food if drivers will of course, too 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.030
 excellent information can be found at www v - Stop Punkt d
