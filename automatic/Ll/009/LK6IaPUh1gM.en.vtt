00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.040
 boys girls ladies and gentlemen with you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
 Sanya dark Vinga channel today again 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.469
 play hartstone heroes of warcraft 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.139
 I created a new warrior deck which 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.570
 based on a winner pack 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.600
 blizzard inca feast stock sep 2013 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.130
 which took place during close on 2013 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.930
 of the year 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.500
 the winners then became are the cis and in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.910
 one in one match more precisely he used 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 very interesting deck which 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
 based too on war and principle 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 action was such 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.870
 many little creatures that stand 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.980
 two three mandas 2 3 mana 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.899
 in reggae and big creatures in small 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 quantity that is, it is thundermash hellscream 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.570
 and in my warehouse it is not at all 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 the creature of course is a bloody howl it 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.199
 weapon ax that uses warrior and me 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 Found what this deck consisted of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.019
 modified slightly balanced under 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 herself and she certainly has her drawbacks 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.600
 for example lack of complete absence 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 taunta 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.799
 but mostly she plays very well and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.509
 if you win the early game then the victory 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.790
 almost guaranteed now we 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.750
 let's see how it stands against 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 the enemy that we come across it 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.140
 priest is not the best deck against 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 model because again I have a very 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.420
 many of these here 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.509
 creatures that he and jess 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 use 2 3 attacks and the bailiff has 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.490
 a lot of cards that can kill them 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.159
 let's say Fedorov 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 shadow world pain or shadow ward with if 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.880
 will be in range 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.259
 a good hand appeared for us began 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.960
 great just if you wonder how 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.390
 my deck looks like you can 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 see her now on the side of the screen 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:11.640
 there is nothing crazy about her 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.260
 what interesting cards he got first 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.989
 move and of course used an ax 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.830
 because he can stick out absolutely 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:23.959
 any creature and i can remove it 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.670
 being so friendly for hill 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 Of course this is a show off at the beginning because 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.180
 play throw him absolutely nothing 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 let's leave the berserk 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.500
 such a magnet for bullets kind of 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.310
 there is he can or play something against 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.680
 him or destroy him again 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.319
 some of our magic is our flynn 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.860
 sleep count that steel he copy 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.180
 two two cards from my deck and hopefully 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 I will not get thunder because at this 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.530
 you can finish right away so we 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.180
 can do we can do the following 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.040
 use vargin but i don't have 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.370
 coins means we can use it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.700
 before animals live and sell it 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.359
 fives and on the other hand there is a chance that 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.989
 I can get the next move rampage and 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.380
 Then for bafat disabled master who 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.140
 puts on exit 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.850
 throwing out the battlefield on your own 3 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.760
 damage which is very good in combination with 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:37.319
 ramp and jim or rated authority i think 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.269
 warsong commander until i'm in 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.380
 I don't know his rage 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:47.760
 why is it worth it he cuts like he 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.160
 Now there is an opportunity to overrun themselves from 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.579
 this damage i don't know i want me 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.069
 I want a little more meat so to speak 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.709
 I will make a rating in the next move 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.310
 body whirlwind what kind of enraged it 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.280
 completely 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.580
 we have it goes with us 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.250
 i'm not the best idea honestly 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.340
 saying here we have drawn 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.200
 5 stroke engine blade master combination 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.090
 rampage now we do the following u 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:28.110
 charger gets us our vargin in raid 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:33.919
 we remove here she and he gets from us 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.740
 very strongly and suddenly for no reason 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.270
 priest dropped to 13 x n 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.710
 you can of course remove this holly 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.040
 new what is it actually doing 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:52.440
 a good card came across to him 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:57.650
 I don't have much damage, let's do 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.650
 next eagert blade master in rampage 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.570
 what makes it 73 looks very 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.180
 dangerous we can still damage up to units 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.480
 ax which he is now at this stage 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.130
 we don’t need it anymore 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.840
 I think so because six is ​​mono 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:21.460
 already bigger creatures 7 6 plus 5 bye 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:24.190
 no arch neutral rapper is stellar 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.930
 a combination if he doesn't charge and he 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.330
 does the same thing and what are we going 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.250
 do not do not do not use 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.750
 nothing please about finish the move 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.610
 just finish the move please like this 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:49.810
 here actually we can say 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:53.410
 won channel 37 and 5 press 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.970
 goes to oblivion 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.570
 interesting game here is such an interesting 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.770
 deck 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.410
 again I tell me there are a lot of minuses 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.270
 such as lack of talent or not 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.390
 serious meat to use game 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.840
 except Droma show me but whole me 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.190
 like this deck I'm fun at night and 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.070
 unpleasantly wins with you was sanya 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.990
 dark wish you all the best and 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.990
 on the battlefield 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.199
 2
