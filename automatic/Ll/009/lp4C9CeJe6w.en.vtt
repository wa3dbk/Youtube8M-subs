for<00:00:57.020> three<00:00:57.170> days<00:00:57.440> before<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:57.950> got<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.400> old<00:00:58.460> fly

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
for three days before I got that old fly

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.340 
for three days before I got that old fly
back<00:00:59.060> up<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.480> it<00:00:59.540> was<00:00:59.630> sure<00:00:59.810> good<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.170> have

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
back up and it was sure good to have

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.680 
back up and it was sure good to have
back<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.710> walls<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.030> kitchen<00:01:02.510> and

back the walls of it of the kitchen and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.539 
back the walls of it of the kitchen and
have<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:02.989> warmth<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.649> guess<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.399> other

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
have the warmth I guess the other

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.370 
have the warmth I guess the other
probably<00:01:05.149> one<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.479> sticks<00:01:05.659> out<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:05.990> my<00:01:06.020> mind

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
probably one that sticks out in my mind

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.340 
probably one that sticks out in my mind
more<00:01:06.590> than<00:01:06.770> anything<00:01:06.920> else<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:08.140> some<00:01:09.140> folks

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
more than anything else is some folks

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.050 
more than anything else is some folks

place to sleep at night the mosquitoes

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.149 
place to sleep at night the mosquitoes

what eating you up and we sweated
running<00:01:19.399> off<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.170> one<00:01:21.170> hundred<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:21.499> six

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
running off of you one hundred and six

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.010 
running off of you one hundred and six
or<00:01:21.859> seven<00:01:22.189> degrees<00:01:22.549> with<00:01:22.880> their<00:01:23.060> humidity<00:01:23.689> was

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
or seven degrees with their humidity was

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.620 
or seven degrees with their humidity was
pretty<00:01:24.289> miserable<00:01:24.560> but<00:01:25.159> uh<00:01:25.189> my<00:01:26.030> daddy<00:01:26.420> always

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
pretty miserable but uh my daddy always

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.389 
pretty miserable but uh my daddy always
told<00:01:26.990> me<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.259> hang<00:01:27.469> a<00:01:27.560> shingle<00:01:27.770> out<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.249> don't

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
told me you hang a shingle out and don't

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.469 
told me you hang a shingle out and don't
matter<00:01:28.579> what<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.909> weather<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
matter what the weather is in the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.149 
matter what the weather is in the
condition<00:01:29.719> you<00:01:30.139> could<00:01:30.350> can<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.649> get<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:30.979> done

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
condition you could can you get it done

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.609 
condition you could can you get it done
so<00:01:31.520> weather<00:01:32.179> plays<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.539> great<00:01:32.929> factor<00:01:33.380> in

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
so weather plays a great factor in

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.330 
so weather plays a great factor in
cooking<00:01:34.310> in<00:01:34.520> what<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:34.850> do<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:36.319> guess<00:01:37.159> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
cooking in what we do but I guess the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.489 
cooking in what we do but I guess the
breeze<00:01:37.579> is<00:01:37.909> probably<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.600> worst<00:01:38.810> because

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
breeze is probably the worst because

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.899 
breeze is probably the worst because
when<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:39.770> got<00:01:39.889> a<00:01:39.950> breeze<00:01:40.249> with<00:01:40.490> your<00:01:40.670> cooking

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
when you got a breeze with your cooking

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.580 
when you got a breeze with your cooking
it's<00:01:41.209> like<00:01:41.359> in<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.569> microwave<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.350> an<00:01:42.439> old

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's like in the microwave to an old

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.160 
it's like in the microwave to an old
