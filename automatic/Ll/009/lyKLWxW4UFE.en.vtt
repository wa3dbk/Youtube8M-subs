00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.850
 I'm fine so far and I'm happy 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.330
 At the same time days with the team too 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.980
 his 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.650
 the whole time with the team 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 I was actually spending time 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.050
 Shortly before, direction again 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 but I always have problems with the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.869
 agility and am in june 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 now atos have been copied again 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 and unfortunately there are more problems 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.890
 everything expected and now I have to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.890
 build muscle once 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.090
 I have to say 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 it's always getting worse 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.930
 presented because I really only 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 friends and family really great 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.339
 support cup of course the are 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.199
 first weeks with crutches and so on 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.410
 nobody really wants that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 but then it's actually gone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.129
 was in the reha step by step 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 even so his everyday life has so 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.210
 lived through and of which he actually it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.549
 went well then you have one 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.049
 Of course you found your own program 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.509
 step by step very small 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.840
 but somehow you also have the task 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.360
 and once that light exercise 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.720
 again beginning a machine goes again 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 better 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.600
 ebels the last few weeks a lot 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.530
 Muscle building was the first time 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.330
 very relaxed but only very relaxed 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.159
 coordination manager seilspringen 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.119
 that's the way things are right now 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.119
 befit 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.990
 that's hard to say so my 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.560
 Kreuzband and everything meanwhile very much 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.240
 Well not healed by that but until the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.930
 Musculature is back up there 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.840
 really takes 100 percent fits 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.580
 just his time and there just weeks 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.090
 or months to define is difficult too 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.710
 say 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.300
 she hopes that as fast as possible 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.150
 but the goal is simple meanwhile 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.100
 really 100 percent fit again too 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.280
 and then quite healthy in the place too 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.280
 stand
