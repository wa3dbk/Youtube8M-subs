00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.240 
microwave for about 30 second increments
until<00:03:41.659> it's<00:03:41.959> completely<00:03:42.349> melted<00:03:42.500> stirring

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
and in between and then I think it's

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.619

easier<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.129> you<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:46.250> use<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.700> little<00:03:47.060> bottle

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
with a little tip on it or you could use

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.050 
with a little tip on it or you could use
a<00:03:50.870> little<00:03:51.079> pastry<00:03:51.560> bag<00:03:51.769> or<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.699> could<00:03:52.849> even
