00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
in this video I will be showing you how

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.880 
in this video I will be showing you how
to<00:00:03.090> improve<00:00:03.840> transformers<00:00:04.560> generations

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
to improve transformers generations

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.400 
to improve transformers generations
Armada<00:00:05.819> Starscream<00:00:06.480> now<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.140> most<00:00:07.259> part

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
Armada Starscream now for the most part

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.990 
Armada Starscream now for the most part
I<00:00:07.560> really<00:00:07.980> like<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.309> figure<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:08.730> really

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
I really like this figure it's really

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.669 
I really like this figure it's really
really<00:00:09.480> well<00:00:09.630> made<00:00:09.809> as<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> great<00:00:10.349> autumn<00:00:10.620> oh

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
really well made as a great autumn oh

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.110 
really well made as a great autumn oh
that's<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> great<00:00:11.099> robot<00:00:11.490> mode<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that's a great robot mode the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.299 
that's a great robot mode the
transformation<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.809> pretty<00:00:13.049> fluid<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:14.190> there

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
transformation is pretty fluid but there

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.560 
transformation is pretty fluid but there
is<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.429> problem<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.059> figure<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.509> I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
is one problem with this figure that I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.120 
is one problem with this figure that I
feel<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:15.990> needs<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.529> addressed<00:00:16.770> which

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
feel really needs to be addressed which

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700 
feel really needs to be addressed which
is<00:00:17.369> either<00:00:18.090> his<00:00:18.359> backpack<00:00:18.840> 6<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.439> his<00:00:19.529> back

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
is either his backpack 6 off of his back

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.340 
is either his backpack 6 off of his back
by<00:00:19.949> two<00:00:20.010> inches<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.810> love<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
by two inches or and I love that you can

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.660 
by two inches or and I love that you can
do<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.859> if<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> fold<00:00:23.369> back<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
do this but if you fold back the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.029 
do this but if you fold back the
backpack<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.470> doesn't<00:00:25.619> stick<00:00:25.920> out

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
backpack like this it doesn't stick out

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.910 
backpack like this it doesn't stick out
as<00:00:26.220> far<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.300> same<00:00:27.660> bits<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.289> make<00:00:28.529> his

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
as far but the same bits that make his

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130 
as far but the same bits that make his
backpack<00:00:29.340> stick<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:29.910> far<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> did<00:00:30.570> now

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
backpack stick out as far as it did now

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
backpack stick out as far as it did now
intrude<00:00:31.590> upon<00:00:31.679> his<00:00:31.980> legs<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.489> cannot<00:00:32.759> pose

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
intrude upon his legs so we cannot pose

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.319 
intrude upon his legs so we cannot pose
as<00:00:33.239> well<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.520> for<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.610> modification<00:00:35.969> we're

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
as well so for this modification we're

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
as well so for this modification we're
going<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.690> removing<00:00:37.140> these<00:00:37.260> orange<00:00:37.680> bits

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
going to be removing these orange bits

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
going to be removing these orange bits
and<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:39.510> basically<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.050> means<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.350> leave

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and this basically this means that leave

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
and this basically this means that leave
without<00:00:40.860> missile-firing<00:00:41.219> gimmick<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:41.879> not

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
without missile-firing gimmick will not

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
without missile-firing gimmick will not
be<00:00:42.450> active<00:00:42.840> anymore<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> love<00:00:44.340> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
be active anymore so if you love this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
be active anymore so if you love this
figure<00:00:44.760> partially<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.329> how<00:00:46.140> far<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> shoot

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
figure partially for how far can shoot

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.930 
figure partially for how far can shoot
missiles<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.340> can't<00:00:47.579> shoot<00:00:47.730> missiles

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
missiles and they can't shoot missiles

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
missiles and they can't shoot missiles
pretty<00:00:48.300> far<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> modification

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
pretty far this is not the modification

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
pretty far this is not the modification
for<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.610> now<00:00:51.510> after<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.520> check<00:00:53.520> out<00:00:53.640> these

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
for you now after we check out these

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
for you now after we check out these
orange<00:00:54.090> bits<00:00:54.300> well<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> look<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.800> prefer

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
orange bits well if you look I prefer

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
orange bits well if you look I prefer
how<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> missiles<00:00:56.910> look<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.629> yeah<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
how the missiles look with yeah the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.479 
how the missiles look with yeah the
missile<00:00:58.289> pods<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.649> probably<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
missile pods I probably look with the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.299 
missile pods I probably look with the
missiles<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.800> fill<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
missiles in then out and they fill in

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.439 
missiles in then out and they fill in
the<00:01:02.399> detail<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.420> more

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the detail make it look a bit more

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.030 
the detail make it look a bit more
interesting<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.199> maybe<00:01:04.409> even<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
interesting in there maybe even make it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
interesting in there maybe even make it
look<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> jet<00:01:06.090> detail<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
look like so bit of a jet detail so the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.810 
look like so bit of a jet detail so the
other<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.640> we're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
other thing we're going to do is we're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
other thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.210> taking<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.689> clippers<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to be taking these clippers and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.960 
going to be taking these clippers and
we're<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.250> clipping<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> missiles

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
we're going to be clipping the missiles

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
we're going to be clipping the missiles
right<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.979> when<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
right about here so so that when the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.420 
right about here so so that when the
missiles<00:01:14.939> are<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.420> missile<00:01:15.780> pods<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
missiles are in the missile pods the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
missiles are in the missile pods the
length<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> missiles<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.299> be

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
length of the missiles will not be

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.240 
length of the missiles will not be
causing<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> same<00:01:19.020> problem<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> orange

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
causing the same problem that the orange

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.090 
causing the same problem that the orange
bits<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.880> dated<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:22.020> follow<00:01:22.979> along

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bits back here dated so follow along

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
bits back here dated so follow along
with<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.840> but

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
with me as I do this if you want but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.600 
with me as I do this if you want but
I'll<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.710> clipping<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> missiles<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'll be clipping the missiles at the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
I'll be clipping the missiles at the
very<00:01:26.820> end<00:01:27.060> after<00:01:27.570> you've<00:01:27.930> seen<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
very end after you've seen how this

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.850 
very end after you've seen how this
looks<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.770> jet<00:01:29.009> mode<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.990> realize

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
looks in jet mode so if you just realize

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
looks in jet mode so if you just realize
that<00:01:31.890> oh<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> need<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:32.909> orange<00:01:33.270> bits

gimmick inside of the figure it doesn't

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.170 
gimmick inside of the figure it doesn't
matter<00:03:04.190> if<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.370> hell<00:03:04.580> down<00:03:04.730> quite<00:03:05.030> as

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
matter if it's hell down quite as

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.089 
matter if it's hell down quite as
tightly<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.750> aren't<00:03:06.200> any<00:03:06.349> important

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
tightly because aren't any important

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.509 
tightly because aren't any important
parts<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.819> jangling<00:03:08.239> around<00:03:09.519> so

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
parts are going to be jangling around so

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.390 
parts are going to be jangling around so
once<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.030> get<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.810> put<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.350> together<00:03:12.560> this

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
once you get is put back together this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.750 
once you get is put back together this
will<00:03:13.549> be<00:03:13.609> enough<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.390> purposes<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
will be enough for the purposes of the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.310 
will be enough for the purposes of the
modification<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.910> show<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.420> make<00:03:18.200> sure

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
modification to show it to you make sure

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.960 
modification to show it to you make sure
you<00:03:18.410> do<00:03:18.560> put<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.829> other<00:03:18.950> screws<00:03:19.280> back<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.489> but

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you do put the other screws back in but

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.120 
you do put the other screws back in but
they're<00:03:20.090> not<00:03:20.120> important<00:03:20.600> right<00:03:20.750> now<00:03:20.920> okay<00:03:21.920> so

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
they're not important right now okay so

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.490 
they're not important right now okay so
now<00:03:22.850> as<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.060> can<00:03:23.150> see<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.600> looks<00:03:24.140> pretty<00:03:24.260> good

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
now as you can see it looks pretty good

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.170 
now as you can see it looks pretty good
like<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.829> on<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.069> side<00:03:25.250> it's<00:03:25.790> all<00:03:25.940> as<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> bit

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
like this on the side it's all as a bit

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.789 
like this on the side it's all as a bit
of<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.329> backpack<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:26.930> it's<00:03:27.109> not<00:03:27.260> stick<00:03:27.620> out

quite as far as it did if you put this

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.710 
quite as far as it did if you put this
down<00:03:30.739> like<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.130> you'll<00:03:32.030> still<00:03:32.299> interfere

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
down like this you'll still interfere

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.819 
down like this you'll still interfere
with<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.900> legs<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.319> bit<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:33.620> only

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.650 
with this legs a little bit but only
after<00:03:33.920> legs<00:03:34.250> all<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.670> gone<00:03:34.910> back<00:03:35.150> quite<00:03:35.630> a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
after legs all have gone back quite a

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.629 
after legs all have gone back quite a
ways<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.230> if<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:37.010> really<00:03:37.160> wanted<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.549> you

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
ways so if you really wanted to you

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.080 
ways so if you really wanted to you
could<00:03:37.819> probably<00:03:38.030> um<00:03:38.359> I<00:03:39.459> shave<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.639> bit<00:03:40.850> right

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
could probably um I shave that bit right

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.120 
could probably um I shave that bit right
there<00:03:41.299> down<00:03:41.660> I'm<00:03:42.019> not<00:03:42.350> concerned<00:03:42.739> about<00:03:42.859> it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
there down I'm not concerned about it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.250 
there down I'm not concerned about it
but<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.489> an<00:03:43.639> option<00:03:43.730> if<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.120> want<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.450> before

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
but it's an option if you want it before

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.660 
but it's an option if you want it before
we<00:03:45.380> click<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.739> missiles<00:03:46.069> i'm<00:03:46.250> going<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.549> show

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
we click the missiles i'm going to show

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.860 
we click the missiles i'm going to show
you<00:03:46.700> what<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:46.910> looks<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.510> vehicle

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
you what this looks like in the vehicle

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.250 
you what this looks like in the vehicle
mode<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:48.730> i'm<00:03:49.730> not<00:03:49.880> going<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.329> be<00:03:50.630> going<00:03:51.049> over

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
mode so i'm not going to be going over

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.870 
mode so i'm not going to be going over
the<00:03:51.410> transformation<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.310> since<00:03:52.760> i've

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
the transformation really since i've

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.650 
the transformation really since i've
already<00:03:53.000> reviewed<00:03:53.420> this<00:03:53.540> guy<00:03:53.750> but<00:03:54.049> um<00:03:54.230> i<00:03:55.660> am

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
already reviewed this guy but um i am

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.300 
already reviewed this guy but um i am
going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.139> go<00:03:57.290> ahead<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.590> transform<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.130> on

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
going to go ahead and transform it on

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
going to go ahead and transform it on
camera

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.949 

alright<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.280> here's<00:04:20.489> jet<00:04:20.820> mode<00:04:21.030> here's<00:04:21.750> what

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
alright so here's jet mode here's what

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.300 
alright so here's jet mode here's what
it<00:04:22.020> looks<00:04:22.170> like<00:04:22.290> without<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:22.740> little

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
it looks like without these little

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.090 
it looks like without these little
orange<00:04:23.460> bit<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.500> looks<00:04:25.530> pretty<00:04:25.740> good

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
orange bit I think it looks pretty good

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.830 
orange bit I think it looks pretty good
I<00:04:26.340> do<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> looked<00:04:27.330> better<00:04:27.540> with<00:04:27.750> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
I do think it looked better with the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.090 
I do think it looked better with the
orange<00:04:28.020> bits<00:04:28.320> by<00:04:28.470> more<00:04:28.680> than<00:04:28.710> willing<00:04:28.950> to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
orange bits by more than willing to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.160 
orange bits by more than willing to
accept<00:04:29.490> not<00:04:29.670> having<00:04:30.090> these<00:04:30.210> orange<00:04:30.630> bits<00:04:30.870> and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
accept not having these orange bits and

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.620 
accept not having these orange bits and
having<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.920> slightly<00:04:32.250> weaker<00:04:32.400> jet<00:04:32.850> mode<00:04:33.120> to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
having a slightly weaker jet mode to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.170 
having a slightly weaker jet mode to
have<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.810> much<00:04:34.170> much<00:04:34.380> stronger<00:04:34.710> robot<00:04:35.190> mode<00:04:35.400> so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
have a much much stronger robot mode so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.760 
have a much much stronger robot mode so
the<00:04:36.270> final<00:04:36.420> bit<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:37.140> modification<00:04:37.680> we're

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
the final bit of the modification we're

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.870 
the final bit of the modification we're
going<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:37.980> do<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.160> we're<00:04:38.250> going<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.460> take<00:04:38.550> these

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
going to do is we're going to take these

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.090 
going to do is we're going to take these
missiles<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.480> we're<00:04:40.260> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.530> clip<00:04:40.950> them

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
missiles and we're going to clip them

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.760 
missiles and we're going to clip them
off<00:04:41.420> right<00:04:42.420> around<00:04:42.750> here<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:45.560> like<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.710> is

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
off right around here or so like it is

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.010 
off right around here or so like it is
and<00:04:47.090> then<00:04:48.090> we're<00:04:48.210> going<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.420> put<00:04:48.600> them<00:04:48.780> into

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
and then we're going to put them into

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.900 
and then we're going to put them into
the<00:04:49.440> missile<00:04:49.710> pods<00:04:49.890> like<00:04:50.190> this<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:51.680> voila<00:04:52.910> do

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
the missile pods like this and voila do

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.140 
the missile pods like this and voila do
it<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.330> other<00:04:54.360> missile<00:04:55.850> right<00:04:56.850> around

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
it to the other missile right around

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.430 
it to the other missile right around
here<00:04:59.390> the<00:05:00.390> reason<00:05:00.600> why<00:05:00.660> I'm<00:05:00.750> not<00:05:00.900> cutting<00:05:01.170> it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
here the reason why I'm not cutting it

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.770 
here the reason why I'm not cutting it
off<00:05:01.650> right<00:05:02.040> behind<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.520> ball<00:05:02.670> is<00:05:02.910> because<00:05:03.600> if

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
off right behind the ball is because if

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.030 
off right behind the ball is because if
you<00:05:03.870> cut<00:05:04.020> off<00:05:04.170> right<00:05:04.410> behind<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.740> ball<00:05:04.860> there

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
you cut off right behind the ball there

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.090 
you cut off right behind the ball there
won't<00:05:05.220> be<00:05:05.370> any<00:05:05.670> length<00:05:06.330> back<00:05:06.660> here<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.620> press

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
won't be any length back here to press

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.320 
won't be any length back here to press
against<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.520> sides<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.120> missile

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
against the sides of the missile

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.940 
against the sides of the missile
compartment<00:05:09.600> so<00:05:09.990> then<00:05:10.170> it<00:05:10.350> will<00:05:10.470> cause<00:05:10.650> the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
compartment so then it will cause the

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.980 
compartment so then it will cause the
missile<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.910> maybe<00:05:12.060> jangle<00:05:12.450> around<00:05:12.690> in<00:05:12.870> there

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
missile to maybe jangle around in there

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.050 
missile to maybe jangle around in there
a<00:05:13.020> little<00:05:13.140> bit<00:05:13.320> more<00:05:13.530> so<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.760> can<00:05:14.880> probably

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
a little bit more so you can probably

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.240 
a little bit more so you can probably
cut<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.450> closer<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.840> them<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.830> ball<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.190> the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
cut it closer to them to the ball of the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.580 
cut it closer to them to the ball of the
missile<00:05:17.580> but<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.450> in<00:05:18.630> case<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:19.260> because<00:05:19.500> it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
missile but just in case and because it

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.470 
missile but just in case and because it
doesn't<00:05:19.830> hurt<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.310> cut<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.910> bit<00:05:20.940> away

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
doesn't hurt it to cut it a bit away

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.510 
doesn't hurt it to cut it a bit away
from<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.840> ball<00:05:21.990> I'm<00:05:22.350> doing<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.920> like<00:05:23.100> this<00:05:23.280> and

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
from the ball I'm doing it like this and

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.260 
from the ball I'm doing it like this and
from<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.630> front<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.930> looks<00:05:24.990> great<00:05:25.350> and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
from the front it looks great and

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.350 
from the front it looks great and
overall<00:05:27.270> i<00:05:27.510> am<00:05:28.340> i'm<00:05:29.340> very<00:05:29.610> happy<00:05:29.760> without<00:05:30.090> this

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
overall i am i'm very happy without this

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.190 
overall i am i'm very happy without this
modification<00:05:30.720> has<00:05:31.050> worked<00:05:31.290> out<00:05:32.780> if<00:05:33.780> it's<00:05:34.020> all

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
modification has worked out if it's all

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.540 
modification has worked out if it's all
the<00:05:34.230> modification<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.980> really<00:05:35.190> want<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.430> do

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
the modification you really want to do

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.950 
the modification you really want to do
that's<00:05:35.730> fine<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:36.120> figure<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.420> still<00:05:36.630> great

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
that's fine that figure is still great
