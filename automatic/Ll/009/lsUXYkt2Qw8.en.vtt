here<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> pathway<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.940> you've

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
here this is the pathway that you've

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.660 
here this is the pathway that you've
been<00:02:33.210> seen<00:02:33.510> me<00:02:33.990> use<00:02:34.230> most<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.800> game<00:02:35.100> so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
been seen me use most of this game so

been seen me use most of this game so
set<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> portable<00:02:36.570> radar<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.050> down

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
set up the portable radar right down

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.570 
set up the portable radar right down
there<00:02:37.410> where<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> had<00:02:37.740> highlighted<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.400> green

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
there where I had highlighted in green

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
there where I had highlighted in green
and<00:02:38.820> then<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.330> whole<00:02:39.510> yellow<00:02:39.810> area<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.290> sore

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.830 
and then the whole yellow area is sore
that<00:02:40.680> pathway<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.700> used<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.150> go

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that pathway that I kind of used to go

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720 
that pathway that I kind of used to go
back<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.260> forth<00:02:43.440> between<00:02:43.800> people<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.610> are

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
there is one of the main spawn points

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.260 
there is one of the main spawn points
now<00:02:53.160> if<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.340> running<00:02:53.460> what<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.060> kill

streaks<00:02:54.510> use<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.990> map<00:02:55.170> which<00:02:55.440> you

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
streaks use on this map which you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.550 
streaks use on this map which you
specialists<00:02:56.520> use<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.730> salt<00:02:57.290> extra<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
specialists use a salt extra here you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.080 
specialists use a salt extra here you
see<00:02:58.680> me<00:02:58.800> using<00:02:58.950> predator<00:02:59.370> missile<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.700> Reaper

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
see me using predator missile and Reaper

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.640 
see me using predator missile and Reaper
and<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.540> worked<00:03:00.720> really<00:03:00.870> great<00:03:01.350> for<00:03:01.530> me

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
and that worked really great for me

and that worked really great for me
normally<00:03:02.130> air<00:03:02.310> support<00:03:02.730> does<00:03:02.820> not<00:03:02.970> work<00:03:03.210> good

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
from air support is down in that tunnel

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.980

great map for that now there's a ton of
corridors<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> know<00:03:28.560> tight<00:03:28.860> corners<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
corridors and you know tight corners and

corridors and you know tight corners and
it's<00:03:29.820> really<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.240> great<00:03:30.510> math<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:31.080> those

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200

it's really just a great math for those
who<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.620> run<00:03:31.860> around<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.340> use<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
submachine gun again it's a tricky map

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.190 
submachine gun again it's a tricky map
but<00:03:35.700> once<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.060> learn<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.330> those<00:03:36.690> who<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.170> to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
but once you learn it those who like to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.570 
but once you learn it those who like to
run<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.590> gun<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.950> going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.130> be<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> really

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
run and gun it's going to be a really

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.670 
run and gun it's going to be a really
fun<00:03:38.610> great<00:03:39.060> map<00:03:39.300> for<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.540> guys<00:03:39.690> alright<00:03:40.560> so

stay around the outskirts of the map
avoid<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.150> try<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.450> upriver<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.080> middle

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
avoid that try it upriver in the middle

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.560 
avoid that try it upriver in the middle
and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:50.160> use<00:03:50.460> that<00:03:50.490> spot<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.210> showed<00:03:51.540> you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and then use that spot that I showed you

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.930 
and then use that spot that I showed you
there<00:03:51.959> with<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.350> portable<00:03:52.890> radar<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.730> whole

there with the portable radar the whole
little<00:03:54.209> pathway<00:03:54.570> there<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.380> connect

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
little pathway there can that connect

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.830 
little pathway there can that connect
the<00:03:55.770> one<00:03:56.040> spawn<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.700> then<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.910> river<00:03:57.120> use

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the one spawn and then the river use

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
the one spawn and then the river use
that<00:03:58.140> their<00:03:58.470> use<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.040> bridges<00:03:59.520> you<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.030> if
