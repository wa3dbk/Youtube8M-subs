00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.750
 to be able to correctly explain the 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.309
 company finally guides account for 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.990
 come almost 200 years back 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.910
 the company of guides there is almost 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.490
 two hundred years ago he had an accident at the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.810
 mountain on the on the white mount at the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 Following this accident guides are 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.010
 dead is following this accident while 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.860
 simply a solidarity fund has been 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.660
 created a spare box what we 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.559
 we now call because a kind 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.050
 of first social security his pose and 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.560
 the fundamentals of the structure it's up to 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.350
 to say that 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.330
 with this solidarity fund one can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 now and 200 years later we can 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.070
 always come to the aid of guides and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 families of the guides who are injured from 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 members of the structure of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 companions today in 2015 we 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 realizes that the guides are 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.170
 always innovative in their 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.480
 mountain practice 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.400
 whether by the races that must be 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.930
 whether by the first one that 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.510
 offer that we are still doing or that this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.450
 through different partnerships 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 there are about 260 members within 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.869
 the company guides guides and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 mountain guide in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.320
 its 260 members 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 I also include our old ones that we 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.750
 call the fees that always make 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.170
 part of our big family 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.690
 it's also a philosophy and a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.930
 completely unique work sharing 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.930
 in the world 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.280
 then the partnership between thousands to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 company of guides I think it's 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
 worth a side story 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.260
 historical and valuable stories 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 that is, miley was a forerunner 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.790
 1950 the annapurna I can do 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 easily link with the ex pederson 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.510
 lachenal lachenal is a guide to the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.790
 company of guides he was at the top 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.620
 from the annapurna together we can come back 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 we can still continue in history 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.630
 the late 80s early 90s 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.980
 the great saga the trilogy christophe 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.620
 profit member of the guide company 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.470
 also a particular moment partners of 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.570
 millet more recently simply 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.640
 face of the annapurna yannick graziani 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.220
 still a member of the company that has 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.040
 done with steph stÃ©phane benoÃ®t this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.630
 famous south face certainly the last 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.940
 one of the great great achievements of 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.770
 the year then the partnership its values 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.350
 it's going to be innovation values 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.120
 we want to talk about it's going to be values â€‹â€‹of 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.680
 work it's going to be values mostly 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.150
 the values of men meeting between 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.460
 some men between office people 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.350
 of studies between people who do the 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.880
 promotion between professionals of the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.230
 mountain that they simply go 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.230
 test this material 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.830
 I believe the test committee that was 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.370
 set up about twenty people 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.810
 from all angles I would say of all who have 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.180
 philosophies a little bit different 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.320
 because we find the members 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.830
 from the company of guides we find 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.210
 at millet all the clothes all the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.400
 material that is needed for all 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.070
 our activities and so we set up 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.380
 the tests committee in order to continue in 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.210
 innovation to continue in the the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.230
 search for water if I can 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.810
 allow this expression of the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 perfection of the material so that 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.960
 that we on the ground 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.640
 Well, we are sure to be in a corner with 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.230
 the right person and to have free so 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.520
 the good material still said when I say 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.450
 with the right person site with good 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.450
 sure the good brand 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.400
 we've seen in recent years a big 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.710
 big evolution and not practice 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 sporty mountain who has become 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.340
 exponential 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.280
 we can easily quote practices 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.140
 classic hiking we can go 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 to the adventure park we can go 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.040
 mountain biking of course we 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.960
 our core business activity 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.700
 traditional that I would call a 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.300
 guide a customer label the beautiful image 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.250
 idyllic but I think for me in 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.440
 2015 the most important is not especially 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.800
 opposed these practices but to do in 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.510
 so that people are wanting to go in 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.570
 mountain that we bring these people into 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.040
 mountain and then on the mass there is a 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.290
 or two people who find themselves 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.230
 why not on an 8000 m why not 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.360
 at the top after fo top of the big 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.640
 jorasses and well ben ben and I find 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.750
 how dirty is the meaning of the company 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.810
 guides today is to be 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.269
 able to offer all its activities 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.500
 and bring those moments of happiness that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.940
 we go get these moments 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.550
 magic that is going to get there 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.020
 high up there 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.180
 for me the really wealth of the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.129
 company of guides are its members to 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.110
 as a younger example member of the 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.220
 guide company at 20 years old most 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 old in activity 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.050
 I speak well in activity at age 85 and we 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.449
 sees this handover this handover of 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.500
 know this knowledge of the field and 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.970
 this diversity 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.099
 I also admit that sometimes 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.090
 diversity complicated because it must 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:48.139
 try to advance this great 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.720
 institution these two big 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.580
 associations in a sense and then of 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.870
 once we see that have a small catch 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.880
 little small boats that are on the 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.740
 side 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.000
 I believe for a president of the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.370
 company of the guides got to bring to 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.960
 consider this history hold 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.240
 account of generational differences and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.920
 bring some modernity I believe 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.000
 that's what interests me the most 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.030
 as president of the company of 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.030
 guides 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.750
 1 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.219
 we 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.830
 no 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.820
 he
