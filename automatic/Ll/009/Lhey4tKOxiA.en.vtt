we're going to go into the my soul Hut I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
we're going to go into the my soul Hut I
just<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.850> 133<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.590> taking

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
just see this is my 133 and I'm taking

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.639 
just see this is my 133 and I'm taking
activating<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.940> route<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> reason<00:00:46.320> why

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
activating I'm route now the reason why

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
activating I'm route now the reason why
I'm<00:00:46.800> doing<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.730> particular<00:00:48.059> way<00:00:48.420> it's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
I'm doing it this particular way it's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
I'm doing it this particular way it's
because<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.469> after<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> power<00:00:50.129> first

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
because I'm going after the power first

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
because I'm going after the power first
because<00:00:51.449> what<00:00:51.660> happens<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.739> all

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
because what happens is you can go all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
because what happens is you can go all
the<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:54.030> all<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.270> power<00:00:54.480> right

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the way up and get all this power right

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.430 
the way up and get all this power right
here<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> come<00:00:56.309> back<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
here but then you can come back and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
here but then you can come back and
start<00:00:58.440> doing<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.820> can

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
start doing all these so then I can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
start doing all these so then I can
start<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.930> once<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.680> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
start going up this once I have this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
start going up this once I have this
power<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.219> probably<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
power I'm probably going to go up to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
power I'm probably going to go up to
like<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.539> maybe<00:01:04.140> 50<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> 60<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.339> something

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like maybe maybe 50 is 60 or something

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
like maybe maybe 50 is 60 or something
like<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.600> I'll<00:01:06.780> turn<00:01:06.960> around<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.530> then

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like that then I'll turn around and then

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
like that then I'll turn around and then
you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.460> change<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.850> path<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.840> right

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you can change the path like I go right

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.390 
you can change the path like I go right
there<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.390> what<00:01:12.390> i<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.979> see<00:01:13.979> click

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it this way of course it's going to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.920 
it this way of course it's going to
change<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.740> turn<00:01:50.430> into<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.780> don't

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
change and turn into that and you don't

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
change and turn into that and you don't
want<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.710> takes<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.100> power

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
want that because that takes your power

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.889 
want that because that takes your power
down<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.729> seem<00:01:53.940> like<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.330> power<00:01:54.630> went<00:01:54.810> down

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
down you seem like my power went down

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.040 
down you seem like my power went down
drastically<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> let<00:01:56.970> me<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.750> here

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
drastically so let me go back over here

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.190 
drastically so let me go back over here
and<00:02:00.950> I<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.340> back<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.660> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and I put it back the way it was and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.370 
and I put it back the way it was and
then<00:02:04.470> let's<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.039> out<00:02:05.250> again<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> sitting

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
it goes lower of course for that as you

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.660 
it goes lower of course for that as you
go<00:04:31.850> higher<00:04:31.880> up<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:33.320> seireitei<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:34.310> it's

175 right now don't worry about to go to

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.260 
175 right now don't worry about to go to
the<00:05:49.680> race<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.069> everybody<00:05:50.639> knows<00:05:50.849> that<00:05:50.879> you

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
the race you everybody knows that you

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.629 
the race you everybody knows that you
can<00:05:51.449> farm<00:05:51.719> that<00:05:51.960> pretty<00:05:52.770> much<00:05:52.979> once<00:05:53.279> I<00:05:53.399> start

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
can farm that pretty much once I start

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.629 
can farm that pretty much once I start
when<00:05:53.789> i<00:05:53.879> get<00:05:54.029> around<00:05:55.099> 1400<00:05:56.099> that's<00:05:56.399> when<00:05:56.520> i'll

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
when i get around 1400 that's when i'll

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.459 
when i get around 1400 that's when i'll
start<00:05:56.909> farming<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.599> code<00:05:57.779> the<00:05:57.990> golden<00:05:58.319> ratio

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
start farming the code the golden ratio

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.529 
start farming the code the golden ratio
and<00:05:58.830> i'll<00:05:58.979> probably<00:05:59.189> have<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.729> by<00:06:00.059> the<00:06:00.119> time<00:06:00.389> I

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
and i'll probably have it by the time I

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.589 
and i'll probably have it by the time I
hit<00:06:00.569> 1800<00:06:01.469> so<00:06:02.189> I'm<00:06:02.460> definitely<00:06:02.969> getting<00:06:03.300> there

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
hit 1800 so I'm definitely getting there

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.749 
hit 1800 so I'm definitely getting there
I<00:06:03.779> never<00:06:04.139> had<00:06:04.319> the<00:06:04.349> SSS<00:06:05.039> character<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:05.639> this
