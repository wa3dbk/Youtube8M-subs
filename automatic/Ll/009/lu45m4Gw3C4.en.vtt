00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
similar to the cronusmax and that you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.189 
similar to the cronusmax and that you
connect<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:29.330> other<00:00:30.330> controllers<00:00:30.929> to

connect up your other controllers to
most<00:00:32.070> consoles<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.579> still<00:00:32.820> work<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.120> ps3

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
most consoles that still work with ps3

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.990 
most consoles that still work with ps3
xbox360<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.620> they're<00:00:34.770> working<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.130> ps4<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:59.970 

opening<00:00:51.130> clear

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.280 

so<00:01:00.520> what<00:01:00.640> happens<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.630> plugs<00:01:02.020> into<00:01:02.200> the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
so what happens is this plugs into the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.240 
so what happens is this plugs into the
Xbox<00:01:02.500> there'd<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.070> no<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.530> USB<00:01:06.100> cable

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
Xbox there'd be no see the USB cable

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.210 
Xbox there'd be no see the USB cable
goes<00:01:06.520> here<00:01:06.730> Arduino<00:01:07.090> into<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.330> Xbox<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
goes here Arduino into the Xbox and that

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.430 
goes here Arduino into the Xbox and that
emulates<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.060> 360<00:01:10.540> controller<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:11.020> still<00:01:11.230> have

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
emulates a 360 controller you still have

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.380 
emulates a 360 controller you still have
a<00:01:11.470> 360<00:01:12.010> controller<00:01:12.300> plugged<00:01:13.300> into<00:01:13.480> your<00:01:13.660> PC

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
a 360 controller plugged into your PC

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.969 
a 360 controller plugged into your PC
but<00:01:16.390> that's<00:01:17.200> just<00:01:17.440> because<00:01:17.650> the

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
but that's just because the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.400 
but that's just because the
authentication<00:01:18.510> Microsoft<00:01:19.510> does<00:01:19.690> special

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
authentication Microsoft does special

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.960 
authentication Microsoft does special
security<00:01:20.530> stuff<00:01:21.040> just<00:01:21.220> piss<00:01:21.430> people<00:01:21.550> off<00:01:21.790> I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
security stuff just piss people off I

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.550 
security stuff just piss people off I
guess<00:01:22.120> but<00:01:23.310> yeah<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.630> lets<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.110> run<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
guess but yeah and this lets you run the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.610 
guess but yeah and this lets you run the
serial<00:01:26.979> into<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.610> arduino<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.479> then<00:01:29.470> you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
serial into the arduino and then you

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.160 
serial into the arduino and then you
just<00:01:29.830> output<00:01:30.210> two<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.330> men's<00:01:31.570> from<00:01:31.960> your

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
just output two of men's from your

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.140 
just output two of men's from your
computer<00:01:32.619> they're<00:01:33.340> going<00:01:33.610> down<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.850> goes<00:01:33.970> the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
computer they're going down it goes the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.800 
computer they're going down it goes the
Xbox<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:35.140> works<00:01:35.320> good<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.300> just<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.660> hub

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
Xbox it works good this is just a hub
