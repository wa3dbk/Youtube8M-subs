to make all your camera movements and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140 
to make all your camera movements and
everything<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.070> then<00:02:21.280> afterwards<00:02:22.030> you're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
everything and then afterwards you're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.780 
everything and then afterwards you're
gonna<00:02:22.300> want<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.890> little<00:02:24.160> explosion

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
gonna want to do the little explosion

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.100 
gonna want to do the little explosion
but<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.300> tutorial<00:02:25.780> I'm<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.080> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
but for this tutorial I'm just going to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.290 
but for this tutorial I'm just going to
show<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.320> how<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.180> guys

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
show you how to do it and then you guys

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.140 
show you how to do it and then you guys
can<00:02:28.540> probably<00:02:28.750> figure<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.650> once<00:02:29.860> you're

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
can probably figure it out once you're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.690 
can probably figure it out once you're
applying<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.540> whatever<00:02:31.690> you're<00:02:31.930> doing<00:02:32.200> so

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
go over to explosion FX not explosion

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.979 
go over to explosion FX not explosion
explosion<00:03:13.269> FX<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.549> as<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.570> see<00:03:16.630> there's

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
explosion FX and as you can see there's

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.270 
explosion FX and as you can see there's
a<00:03:17.019> bunch<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.230> red<00:03:17.410> lines<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.040> bunch<00:03:18.190> of

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
a bunch of red lines it's a bunch of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.620 
a bunch of red lines it's a bunch of
things<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.820> do<00:03:18.970> edit

things you can do edit
around<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.470> stuff<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:21.700> first<00:03:22.420> you're<00:03:22.570> gonna

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
around and stuff but first you're gonna

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.470 
around and stuff but first you're gonna
want<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.930> drag<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.800> explosion<00:03:24.370> effects<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
want to drag the explosion effects on to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.720 
want to drag the explosion effects on to
extreme<00:03:25.870> nerves<00:03:26.190> until<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> see<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.550> arrow

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
extreme nerves until you see the arrow

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.070 
extreme nerves until you see the arrow
pointing<00:03:28.090> down<00:03:28.270> just<00:03:28.570> like<00:03:28.690> what<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.930> did

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
pointing down just like what you did

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.910 
pointing down just like what you did
with<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.320> text<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:30.210> now<00:03:31.210> as<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.450> can<00:03:31.570> see<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
with the text and now as you can see the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.380 
with the text and now as you can see the
explosion<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.670> applied<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.350> text<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:37.740> I

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
explosion is applied to the text so I

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.550 
explosion is applied to the text so I
guess<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.630> show<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.930> little<00:03:41.080> bit<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.320> key

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
guess I can show you a little bit of key

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.400 
guess I can show you a little bit of key
framing<00:03:41.890> what<00:03:42.130> you're<00:03:42.220> going<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.400> want<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.640> do

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
framing what you're going to want to do

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.230 
framing what you're going to want to do
turn<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.500> your<00:03:44.680> auto<00:03:44.860> key<00:03:45.190> framing<00:03:45.520> go<00:03:45.910> into

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
turn on your auto key framing go into

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.470 
turn on your auto key framing go into
explosion<00:03:46.930> effects<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.770> go<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> object<00:03:48.940> and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
explosion effects and go to object and

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.920 
explosion effects and go to object and
the<00:03:49.750> time<00:03:50.050> will<00:03:50.560> put<00:03:50.800> down<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.310> zero<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:54.930> we

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
the time will put down to zero and we

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.150 
the time will put down to zero and we
can<00:03:55.960> just<00:03:56.440> go<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:57.190> about<00:03:58.710> I'll<00:03:59.710> say<00:03:59.890> ten

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
can just go to about I'll say ten

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.650 
can just go to about I'll say ten
keyframes<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.240> make<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:02.160> big<00:04:03.160> like<00:04:03.660> big

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
keyframes and make it big like big

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.720 
keyframes and make it big like big
explosion<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:07.020> about<00:04:08.020> about<00:04:10.470> 20<00:04:11.470> 26<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.580> guess

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
explosion like about about 20 26 I guess

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.930 
explosion like about about 20 26 I guess
it's<00:04:12.940> pretty<00:04:13.060> good<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.940> spread

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
it's pretty good and I like to spread

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.530 
it's pretty good and I like to spread
this<00:04:19.150> out<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.450> lot<00:04:19.780> more<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:22.030> original

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
this out a lot more and the original

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.820 
this out a lot more and the original
thing<00:04:22.960> does<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:23.800> what<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.700> do<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.180> go<00:04:26.110> over

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
thing does so what I do is I go over

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.980 
thing does so what I do is I go over

here and click on these spread this out

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.430 
here and click on these spread this out
a<00:04:29.440> little<00:04:30.370> bit<00:04:32.190> this<00:04:33.190> out<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:34.050> like<00:04:35.050> doing<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
a little bit this out I like doing this

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.570 
a little bit this out I like doing this
a<00:04:35.740> lot<00:04:36.100> because<00:04:37.620> instead<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.680> when<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.310> when<00:04:39.460> it

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
a lot because instead of when it when it

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.210 
a lot because instead of when it when it
normally<00:04:40.270> shatters<00:04:40.690> see<00:04:41.170> I<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.740> dragging<00:04:42.100> it

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
normally shatters see I like dragging it

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.160 
normally shatters see I like dragging it
down<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> little<00:04:42.670> bit<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.240> like<00:04:43.930> that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
down a little bit and just like that

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.980 
down a little bit and just like that
because<00:04:44.830> when<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.100> normally<00:04:45.580> shatters<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.360> lot

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
because when it normally shatters a lot

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.110 
because when it normally shatters a lot
of<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.290> goes<00:04:47.470> down<00:04:47.920> and<00:04:48.280> through<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.820> floor

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
of it goes down and through the floor

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.850 
of it goes down and through the floor
which<00:04:49.690> doesn't<00:04:50.080> really<00:04:50.230> look<00:04:50.440> like<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.620> real

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
which doesn't really look like a real

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.390 
which doesn't really look like a real
shatter

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
shatter

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.980 
shatter
so<00:04:52.060> if<00:04:52.120> you're<00:04:52.210> gonna<00:04:52.330> be<00:04:52.480> doing<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:52.930> way

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
so if you're gonna be doing it this way

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.480 
so if you're gonna be doing it this way
as<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.410> can<00:04:53.560> see<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.770> can<00:04:53.920> still<00:04:54.100> see<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> lot

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
as you can see you can still see a lot

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.130 
as you can see you can still see a lot
of<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.670> particles<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.420> you<00:04:55.720> don't<00:04:55.870> want<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.050> go

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
of the particles so you don't want to go

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.220 
of the particles so you don't want to go
forward<00:04:56.710> in<00:04:56.890> time<00:04:56.920> more<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.930> there<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.050> go

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
forward in time more and there you go

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.350 
forward in time more and there you go
now<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.190> text<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.610> pretty<00:05:00.850> much<00:05:00.970> completely

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
now the text is pretty much completely

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.130 
now the text is pretty much completely
shattered<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:03.240> I'll<00:05:04.240> just<00:05:04.570> play<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.810> back<00:05:05.020> for
