it's<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.930> three<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.530> four<00:02:49.680> hundred<00:02:50.040> watts

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's about three or four hundred watts

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.460 
it's about three or four hundred watts

a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.609> bit<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.970> didn't<00:03:15.329> know<00:03:15.359> means<00:03:15.750> revit

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
a little bit I didn't know means revit

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.800 
a little bit I didn't know means revit
hard<00:03:16.980> at<00:03:17.310> all<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> new<00:03:18.510> car<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
hard at all because it is a new car I

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.150 
hard at all because it is a new car I
don't<00:03:18.989> want<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> push<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.379> to<00:03:19.590> its<00:03:19.620> limits<00:03:19.950> yet

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
don't want to push it to its limits yet

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.190 
don't want to push it to its limits yet
until<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> little<00:03:20.879> broken<00:03:21.150> into<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.780> think

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
until it's a little broken into I think

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.319 
until it's a little broken into I think
I've<00:03:22.260> about<00:03:22.470> 2,000<00:03:23.160> miles<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.180> is

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
I've about 2,000 miles now this is

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.150 
I've about 2,000 miles now this is
actually<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.690> stock<00:03:25.139> exhaust<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.799> do<00:03:25.980> plan

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
actually a stock exhaust and I do plan

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.440 
actually a stock exhaust and I do plan
on<00:03:26.220> getting<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.579> different<00:03:26.730> exhaust<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
on getting a different exhaust in the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.360 
on getting a different exhaust in the
future<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.349> right<00:03:28.560> now<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.799> still<00:03:29.160> think

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
future but for right now I still think

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:40.229 
future but for right now I still think
it<00:03:29.459> sounds<00:03:29.669> really<00:03:29.849> nice

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.670 

now<00:03:41.239> for<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.510> specifications<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.409> car<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
now for the specifications of the car a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.710 
now for the specifications of the car a
little<00:03:42.920> bit<00:03:43.040> more<00:03:43.370> this<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:43.939> Subaru's<00:03:44.299> new

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
little bit more this is Subaru's new

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.229 
little bit more this is Subaru's new
boxer<00:03:45.349> engine<00:03:45.860> with<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.069> stock<00:03:46.579> turbo<00:03:47.060> it's

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
boxer engine with a stock turbo it's

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.420 
boxer engine with a stock turbo it's
actually<00:03:47.659> two<00:03:47.900> liters<00:03:48.290> four<00:03:48.739> cylinders<00:03:49.250> is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
actually two liters four cylinders is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.780 
actually two liters four cylinders is
capable<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.329> about<00:03:50.840> twenty<00:03:51.769> two<00:03:51.950> psi<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.579> boost

capable of about twenty two psi of boost

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.280 
capable of about twenty two psi of boost
although<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.510> believe<00:03:53.629> you<00:03:53.989> could<00:03:54.109> probably

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
although I believe you could probably

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.080 
although I believe you could probably
crank<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.769> little<00:03:54.890> higher<00:03:55.099> on<00:03:55.310> top<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.939> that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
crank it a little higher on top of that

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.380 
crank it a little higher on top of that
it<00:03:56.299> gets<00:03:56.540> 258<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.590> 290<00:03:58.370> pounds<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.909> torque<00:03:59.180> at

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
it gets 258 to 290 pounds of torque at

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.800 
it gets 258 to 290 pounds of torque at
6,500<00:04:00.200> rpms<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.980> get<00:04:01.430> around<00:04:01.640> 25<00:04:02.150> miles<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.720> the

6,500 rpms I get around 25 miles to the
