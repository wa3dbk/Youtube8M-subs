lion-o coming out of his hibernation

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.100 
lion-o coming out of his hibernation
chamber<00:04:58.890> has<00:04:59.130> aged<00:04:59.580> he's<00:05:00.180> now<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.390> full-grown

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
chamber has aged he's now a full-grown

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.880 
chamber has aged he's now a full-grown
man<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:02.730> what<00:05:02.910> is<00:05:02.970> he<00:05:03.060> about<00:05:03.210> 20<00:05:04.050> 21<00:05:04.380> years<00:05:04.710> old

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
man so what is he about 20 21 years old

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.770 
man so what is he about 20 21 years old
he<00:05:05.100> was<00:05:05.190> maybe<00:05:05.400> 10<00:05:05.820> before<00:05:06.030> he<00:05:06.270> went<00:05:06.450> in<00:05:06.570> there

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
he was maybe 10 before he went in there

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.720 
he was maybe 10 before he went in there
so<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.620> makes<00:05:07.800> sense<00:05:07.920> that<00:05:08.280> all<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.610> other

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.960 
so it makes sense that all of the other
