 for one more night at the carnivals 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.189
 beginning the carnivals as 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 the organization has it in mind for 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.870
 give the starting point year after year good 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 Actually yes we're very 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 happy that they always have us in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.059
 account now that for us very 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 important to be integrating this 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.630
 piece of festival that is growing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.480
 very much we already know of the magnitude that 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.610
 it is generating and good now that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 for us we always feel in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.310
 home because the energy that is felt here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.640
 It is very good 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.410
 very much supports the public so it 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 Enjoy river enjoying the stage 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.520
 He had a great time we tried to take the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.050
 music from north to south of the country and 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.510
 we are also pleased to see if it is 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.520
 Pretty enough the life of the artist 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.630
 the musician is like that but that's how he turns 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.850
 to everything 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.250
 the schedule let's say all the clock 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 biological is at this time already starts you 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.870
 to say let's go to sleep and you do not have 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.630
 that try to be able to activate you by 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.100
 there it gets a little complicated but a new 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.530
 job if a new job does 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.920
 one month that came out 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.260
 it would be rather up is a job that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 good thanks to god 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.330
 It has a very nice selection of themes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.520
 for all families so good to me 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 band 21 colorism always if you say 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.360
 always with the rhythm of the band 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.690
 we try now they are going to find a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.060
 theme that is quite modern a single 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.680
 theme after the others are issues that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 good that she is already used to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.239
 people already in those who follow the race 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 the band 21 is going to realize that good 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.950
 always starting in to have that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.560
 those merengueros means arrangements but 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.320
 without losing the tunga tunga that is the one 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.280
 it really makes you dance to people and 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.680
 well which is in that merger is 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.350
 identifies a lot the band will be yuty 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.630
 the incorporated santiago centro marcos and 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.290
 that was frames the skinny good decided 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.070
 get off leave the band for a matter 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.560
 how good we were traveling 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.580
 very much and I also came from 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.780
 years feels the need for good of 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.220
 download a change and what it does in your home 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.860
 to rest for a while now I think that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.500
 is doing is with other projects 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.140
 but good, I needed that impasse that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.990
 out there in the band is complicated not 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.940
 because at the end of the year we are 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.950
 working hard that's the first thing 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.630
 is in the band I do not ask for the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.940
 experience with the years for music 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.280
 what happened for example with tasty 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.459
 that lisandro that had also started 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 left the band we do not have projects for 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.770
 sometime sex ready to work 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.010
 the world leave the band or continue in this 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.200
 look at me when I left the band have run 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.120
 rumors always happens that always 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 runs a wave that everything but when I 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.090
 I left the band I think you could dedicate 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.160
 to produce I would like 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.700
 when I started walking around 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.650
 a lot and there were not many possibilities 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.830
 there are and I know that outside there are many artists 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.129
 many guys who have a lot of ability 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.230
 a lot of talent and there is not that crazy guy 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.739
 I told you you saw the way come here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.390
 this is the road let's go good after 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.629
 to search and search to search 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.510
 look good can be a door of 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.980
 Hernán Río Cuarto if you can enter here 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.569
 but the truth is that it is difficult outside and 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.079
 out there if you're going to touch the place it's very 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:08.840
 guys to live on music is is 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.660
 quite complicated because out there 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.970
 they do not give you the numbers they pay you 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.090
 bit true there are not many places like that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.859
 to be able to live 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.169
 of the music then it would be good 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.510
 produce would like the opportunity to others 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.349
 guys, it would be good when I left 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.069
 here 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:32.560
 there's a lot to sing and that's the idea 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.569
 is the idea to be able to follow up where the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.550
 people up to people as good as 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.039
 that does not increase is when people already 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.370
 I left the ball I think it's going to be 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.080
 there when it is already very much I thank you 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.460

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.889

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.360

 have been here so thanks for being 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.550
