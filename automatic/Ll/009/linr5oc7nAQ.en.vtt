mix then put in a tempura batter mix add
in<00:02:31.360> some<00:02:31.630> corn<00:02:32.170> flour<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.739> don't<00:02:33.520> worry<00:02:33.760> that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
in some corn flour and don't worry that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.530 
in some corn flour and don't worry that
there's<00:02:35.230> some<00:02:35.440> lumps<00:02:35.739> there<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:37.000> try<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.269> mix

the<00:02:39.790> secret<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.480> baking<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.670> tempura<00:02:42.670> crispy

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
the secret of baking the tempura crispy

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.960 
the secret of baking the tempura crispy
and<00:02:43.810> crunchy<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:45.100> gray<00:02:45.280> temperature

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and crunchy is the gray temperature

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.770 
and crunchy is the gray temperature
between<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.230> oil<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.880> tempura

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
between the oil and the tempura

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.559 
between the oil and the tempura
I<00:02:50.080> always<00:02:50.410> put<00:02:50.680> some<00:02:50.890> ice<00:02:51.100> cube<00:02:51.450> into<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
I always put some ice cube into the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.259 
I always put some ice cube into the
tempura<00:02:53.019> legs<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:54.340> will<00:02:54.459> keep<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
tempura legs and that will keep the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.479 
tempura legs and that will keep the
better<00:02:55.540> temperature<00:02:56.230> at<00:02:56.560> icy<00:02:57.220> cold

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
better temperature at icy cold

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.270 
better temperature at icy cold
temperature<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:59.110> we're<00:02:59.350> going<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.590> put<00:02:59.860> all

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
temperature so we're going to put all

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.000 
temperature so we're going to put all
the<00:03:00.340> vegetable<00:03:00.970> into<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.660> better<00:03:01.860> give<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the vegetable into the better give you a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.180 
the vegetable into the better give you a
very<00:03:03.280> thin<00:03:03.940> coating<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:05.110> put<00:03:05.350> them<00:03:05.470> into<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
very thin coating then put them into the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.180 
very thin coating then put them into the
oil<00:03:06.400> make<00:03:07.360> sure<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.930> temperature<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.440> really

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
oil make sure the temperature is really

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.870 
oil make sure the temperature is really
high<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.720> oil<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:11.230> half<00:03:11.560> cooking<00:03:12.340> oil<00:03:12.670> and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
high the oil is half cooking oil and

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.160 
high the oil is half cooking oil and
half<00:03:13.330> sesame<00:03:13.840> oil

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
half sesame oil

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.410 
half sesame oil

these were heighten the flavor of your

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.259 
these were heighten the flavor of your
tempura<00:03:17.049> now<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.590> see<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:18.269> the

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
tempura now you can see that the

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.500 
tempura now you can see that the
vegetables<00:03:19.720> all<00:03:19.959> turn<00:03:20.320> golden<00:03:20.799> brown<00:03:21.510> then

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
vegetables all turn golden brown then

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.620 
vegetables all turn golden brown then
you<00:03:22.630> know<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:23.230> ready<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.880> remove<00:03:25.450> them
