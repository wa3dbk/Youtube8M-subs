you know make it easier we'd not know so
much<00:02:00.960> flying<00:02:01.290> back<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.560> forth<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.280> copies

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
much flying back and forth to get copies

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.120 
much flying back and forth to get copies
of<00:02:02.880> everything<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:04.560> didn't<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.950> any

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of everything we didn't have any

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.710 
of everything we didn't have any
measurements<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:07.910> use<00:02:08.910> yeah<00:02:09.479> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
measurements only it would use yeah we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380 
measurements only it would use yeah we
actually<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> worth<00:02:11.250> noting<00:02:11.640> we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
actually that is that is worth noting we

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually that is that is worth noting we
did<00:02:12.599> not

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
did not

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
did not
we<00:02:13.650> did<00:02:13.800> not<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.720> blueprints<00:02:15.720> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
we did not do this with blueprints you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.010 
we did not do this with blueprints you
know<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.980> was<00:02:17.160> literally<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.870> had

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
know so this was literally we had

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.600 
know so this was literally we had
maximum<00:02:19.530> width<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.280> maximum<00:02:20.790> height<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
maximum width and maximum height and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.550 
maximum width and maximum height and
maximum<00:02:23.610> length<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.270> other<00:02:24.750> than<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.410> we

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
maximum length and other than that we

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.339 
maximum length and other than that we
worked<00:02:25.830> from<00:02:26.069> five<00:02:26.430> photos<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.080> in

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
worked from five photos that we have in

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.000 
worked from five photos that we have in
our<00:02:28.680> heads<00:02:29.209> from<00:02:30.209> our<00:02:30.360> heads<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:31.590> not<00:02:31.769> done

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
our heads from our heads it's not done

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.280 
our heads from our heads it's not done
yet<00:02:32.040> that's<00:02:32.940> worth<00:02:33.209> noting<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:33.840> actually

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
yet that's worth noting it's actually

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.780 
yet that's worth noting it's actually
completely<00:02:34.440> hollow<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.220> inside<00:02:35.310> right

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
completely hollow on the inside right

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.690 
completely hollow on the inside right
now<00:02:36.260> we<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:37.380> going<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> build<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.069> probably<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
now we are going to build out probably a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
now we are going to build out probably a
main<00:02:39.000> engineering<00:02:39.510> probably<00:02:40.410> build<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.709> work

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
main engineering probably build a work

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.660 
main engineering probably build a work
drive<00:02:41.160> probably<00:02:41.910> build<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.209> turbo<00:02:42.540> lift

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
drive probably build a turbo lift

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.280 
drive probably build a turbo lift
actually<00:02:44.670> we've<00:02:44.849> messing<00:02:45.540> around<00:02:45.630> with<00:02:45.870> ideas

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
actually we've messing around with ideas

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.699 
actually we've messing around with ideas
for<00:02:46.470> photon<00:02:46.830> torpedoes<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:48.440> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.500> stuff

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
for photon torpedoes that kind of stuff

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.340 
for photon torpedoes that kind of stuff
so<00:02:50.450> yeah<00:02:51.450> there's<00:02:51.690> definitely<00:02:51.750> gonna<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.170> more

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so yeah there's definitely gonna be more

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.850 
so yeah there's definitely gonna be more
to<00:02:52.410> come<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.830> enterprise<00:02:53.220> episodes<00:02:53.700> but

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
to come in the enterprise episodes but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.789 
to come in the enterprise episodes but
let<00:02:55.860> me<00:02:55.950> take<00:02:56.130> use<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.290> yeah<00:02:58.290> Star<00:02:58.620> Trek

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
let me take use of it yeah Star Trek

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.160 
let me take use of it yeah Star Trek
episodes<00:02:59.250> because<00:02:59.370> I<00:03:00.030> think<00:03:00.930> we're<00:03:01.049> gonna

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
episodes because I think we're gonna

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.690 
episodes because I think we're gonna
we're<00:03:01.650> trying<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> decide<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.580> build

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
we're trying to decide what to build

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.430 
we're trying to decide what to build
next<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.239> if<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> guys<00:03:03.599> want<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.989> put<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
next so if you guys want to put in the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.009 
next so if you guys want to put in the
comments<00:03:04.830> some<00:03:04.950> things<00:03:05.160> you'd<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.519> see

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
comments some things you'd like to see

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.210 
comments some things you'd like to see
you<00:03:07.019> know<00:03:07.110> we'll<00:03:07.260> probably<00:03:07.349> just<00:03:07.920> pick<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you know we'll probably just pick the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.580 
you know we'll probably just pick the
highest-rated<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.239> think<00:03:09.900> as<00:03:10.230> long<00:03:10.530> as

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
highest-rated one I think as long as

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.440 
highest-rated one I think as long as
it's<00:03:10.769> legitimate<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.209> think<00:03:12.330> we

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
it's legitimate and we can we think we

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.569 
it's legitimate and we can we think we
can<00:03:12.599> pull<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.810> off<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:18.650> yeah<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.400> should<00:03:20.549> be

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
can pull it off but yeah it should be

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.520 
can pull it off but yeah it should be
good<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.140> yeah<00:03:22.680> here's<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> inside<00:03:23.609> I<00:03:24.530> think

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
good so yeah here's the inside I think

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.990 
good so yeah here's the inside I think
we're<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.799> we've<00:03:26.190> been<00:03:26.370> talking<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
we're gonna we've been talking about it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.520 
we're gonna we've been talking about it
and<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.299> think<00:03:27.359> we're<00:03:27.600> gonna<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.989> megabill

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and I think we're gonna do a megabill

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.270 
and I think we're gonna do a megabill
probably<00:03:29.190> once<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.579> month<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.120> we're<00:03:30.540> probably

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
probably once a month and we're probably

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.530 
probably once a month and we're probably
gonna<00:03:32.280> open<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.730> up<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> couple<00:03:33.239> other

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
gonna open it up to a couple other

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.080 
gonna open it up to a couple other
people<00:03:33.810> with<00:03:34.140> me<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> live<00:03:34.739> community<00:03:35.190> yep

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
people with me at the live community yep

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.569 
people with me at the live community yep
so<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.109> way<00:03:37.200> we<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.680> these<00:03:37.799> done<00:03:38.010> faster

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
so that way we can get these done faster

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.340 
so that way we can get these done faster
so<00:03:38.850> if<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.060> guys<00:03:39.209> want<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.959> know<00:03:40.079> like<00:03:40.319> I

so if you guys want to you know like I
said<00:03:40.470> leave<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> comments<00:03:41.910> things<00:03:42.090> you'd

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
said leave in the comments things you'd

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.140 
said leave in the comments things you'd
like<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.359> see<00:03:42.569> us<00:03:42.690> build<00:03:43.609> we'll<00:03:44.609> definitely<00:03:44.790> go

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
like to see us build we'll definitely go

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.629 
like to see us build we'll definitely go
to<00:03:45.299> them<00:03:45.450> yeah<00:03:46.170> actually<00:03:46.560> from<00:03:47.220> here<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.549> can

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
to them yeah actually from here you can

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.970 
to them yeah actually from here you can
see<00:03:47.819> how<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.180> massive<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.769> is

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
see how just massive this thing is it is

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.699 
see how just massive this thing is it is
is<00:03:50.790> actually<00:03:51.269> larger<00:03:51.720> than<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:52.109> computer<00:03:52.560> can

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
is actually larger than my computer can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.979 
is actually larger than my computer can
render<00:03:52.920> at<00:03:53.100> one<00:03:53.250> time<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:55.010> like<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.790> have<00:03:57.780> yet<00:03:57.959> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
render at one time so like I have yet to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.809 
render at one time so like I have yet to
see<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> full<00:03:58.560> image<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.100> guess<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.609> hard<00:03:59.670> to

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
see the full image I guess it's hard to

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.670 
see the full image I guess it's hard to
say<00:03:59.940> that<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.560> yeah<00:04:01.880> again<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:04.260> if<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.530> guys
