because back when we started there were
a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.880> segments<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> didn't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.439> any

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
a lot of segments that didn't have any

a lot of segments that didn't have any
organic<00:01:53.009> products<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> mean<00:01:53.880> cookies<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.320> know

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
organic products I mean cookies you know
when<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.829> went<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.159> cookies<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
when we went into cookies that was a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.800 
when we went into cookies that was a
pretty<00:01:57.390> wide<00:01:57.719> open<00:01:58.399> arena<00:01:59.399> now<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.570> not<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
pretty wide open arena now there's not a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.429 
pretty wide open arena now there's not a
lot<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.079> oak<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:02.040> aren't<00:02:02.240> really<00:02:03.240> any<00:02:03.450> open

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
lot of oak there aren't really any open

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
lot of oak there aren't really any open
segments<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.310> lot<00:02:05.460> harder<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> figure

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
segments so it's a lot harder to figure

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.419 
segments so it's a lot harder to figure
out<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.350> new<00:02:07.469> product<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.220> go

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
out what kind of a new product to go

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.029 
out what kind of a new product to go

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
into

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.490 
into
you<00:02:11.000> know<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.239> was<00:02:11.420> one<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.989> reasons

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500
