00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:10.180
 Comix drives directly to the player Gauvain goes ... well ... that's clash! 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.300
 "The best moments" 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.980
 Announcer 1: "Oh, look! It will track "Speaker 2:" But he will have to leave down ... " 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 Will be ... A-ha-ha. I left. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
 Slow down? No! He falls, broken. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.340
 "The best moments. Issue 6 » 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 He's just a bend, stoop! Each tank «Profit» team has everything you need ... 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.160
 Dhabi! Dhabi! Dhabi! He finished off !!! 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.493
 T1 went to take the base. My God! What is it? Just look! That mobility! 

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:46.665
 What surprises me in this game ... These two tanks kept the enemy and delayed the time to win. 

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.880
 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! This is the end! 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.320
 He wins 1 to 1? He managed, 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 but came Xinef, to try to equalize the chances. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.580
 He will soon be 1 on 1 with Ssensei player. Jackou3k attacks, it has little strength, can be a problem ... 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.940
 Xinef! It gets a lot of damage! Xinef could die! 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.860
 Finally falls, but Ssensei on his heels. 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.840
 13 90 to 13 90, Xinef veteran can win Ssensei newcomer - and he succeeds! 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.740
 You should go to the player LeBwa. LeBwa - 100 units of strength! 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.120
 Announcer 1: "Angel gets a double penetration ... three times!" Announcer 2: "Three times. Ha! .. taken away. " 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.980
 Take Angel_Killer players and JaredJIeto. Player took LeBwa, and then POWERSL1DE may have trouble! Take the player POWERSL1DE, 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.800
 Ecl1pse not leave T1 ... although a great help - untouched Straik ... 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.320
 Announcer 2: "Virgin Straik. Without damage! NOnick only burned, but no - it Ecl1pse threw. " Announcer 1: "It Ecl1pse». 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.980
 Yes, minus the player Straik, and now the situation 2: 2 by eights. 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.340
 Ah-ah-ah-ah ... if he can get into the player Batman, this shot will decide everything ... 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.740
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ... there? He is in the bushes! Gets !!! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 2 to 4, but it's just numbers ... 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.660
 Ruster has a big problem: against him YZne_ low, but it burns! low YZne_ could die! 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.540
 Ruster can win. Just a couple of shots - one or two. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.500
 DrTur comes from the side. Or stand Ruster? 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.580
 Be able? 10 seconds! Tever, DrTur - all there. 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.460
 Everything will be decided in the last seconds - or overcome Ruster? 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.180
 Or overcome them? If they will finish it ... it is 1 second - the time is not constant. 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.900
 LittleMac! One! He comes to the wheel. I did not get the first shot at Tanaka player. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.280
 Maybe get a second? Exactly! 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.880
 No-no-no-no! Oh-oh-oh-oh ... 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.580
 LittleMac trying to get there again. It pushed the player Tanaka. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.660
 LittleMac well advanced ... 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.582
 Ouch! Well, figure! He lost 378 units, and it can turn position, 253! 

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:52.960
 Tanaka blown, LittleMac killed the enemy. Excellent! 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.060
 Announcer 1: "69th peranabivayuts the two, it is necessary to quickly disassemble! Torin23 has two shells ... "Speaker 2:" And see ... " 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.700
 Announcer 1: "Behold! Minus 69 minutes - the first went. " 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 Announcer 2: "they know who had shot and ... and there Maliw Maliw works wonders." Announcer 1: "Yes." 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.520
 Announcer 2: "Minus negat1vekoo the player Maliw - ram just killed him." 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.900
 Announcer 1: "Oh-oh-oh. Here 38_Jevis herding Player Daniel_Blond, and the first two more shots ... His T1 nd nice toast ... " 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.040
 Announcer 2: "Minus Forevich». Announcer 1: «Maliw jumps down - there." Announcer 2: "Minus Javis». 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.320
 Announcer 1: "And here it is - the last ..." 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.200
 Announcer 2: «Vinnypushok, a leap of faith! Did not break! Uh, no. I crashed after all. " 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 He can, he can! 20 seconds! No! 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.280
 God, it's very cool salvation that I have seen! 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.320
 Will the survive? God, no! 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.940
 Be able? Maybe, but it is fully open; good shot Djuice. 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.300
 Behind suitable Amazona - he, too, is aiming straight player Djuice! 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.420
 He loses almost all the units strength and die first of their team ... but first to kill the enemy. 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.540
 Deksta trying to ram - what happens? Does it will finish T1 Cunningham? 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.980
 No, Unicum ... Ah !!! It's unbelievable!
