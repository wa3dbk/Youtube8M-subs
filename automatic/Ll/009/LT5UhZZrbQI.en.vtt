00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.309
 on the third of October 1990 the GDR will cease to exist 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.349
 in WarnemÃ¼nde, my father goes to the fourth plate of the People's Navy to the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.939
 armed forces 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 it's gonna go home 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 Georgen and steel out the window 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.640
 a little later, his shipyard is bought up 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 the majority of the employees are dismissed 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.350
 also my mother who worked there since 20 years as the earliest 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 At this time, my parents are 50 years old 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.070
 they do not know how to proceed 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 quite unlike me 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.160
 Five years ago, I had no more and my parents finally 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.960
 left and went to study to Berlin 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.130
 My father finds a job in the security service and moves to the West 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 two years later with a mother behind 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.729
 they offer themselves a tiny social housing and put those at the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.259
 Wand and the Cops Kamieth watch just hang in slope 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.180
 so it looks like home 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 but that is deceptive 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.800
 it is not at home 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.550
 When I visit her for the first time my mother also takes a cigarette after 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.270
 other 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 My dad started drinking and hardly talks 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.020
 My mother leaves my father in 1997 and starts a new life 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 Now there is nothing left for what it's worth 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 systematically my dad is drinking 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 I read the apartment and let the others in charge 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 Neighbors a Russia Germans 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.660
 Years later, I want to know how other families can handle it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.509
 Change to another system 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 and I'm on my way 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.249
 the prosecution on the phone
