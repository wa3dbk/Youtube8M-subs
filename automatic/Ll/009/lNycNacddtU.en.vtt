that<00:01:32.149> it<00:01:32.299> is<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> common<00:01:32.869> theme<00:01:33.109> in<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.439> youth

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
that it is a common theme in the youth

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.219

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
eventually still the most important so

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.060

can<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.720> shooting<00:02:32.200> passing<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.850> can<00:02:34.030> also

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
can be shooting passing but it can also

there<00:02:53.980> will<00:02:54.100> be<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.310> bit<00:02:54.490> more<00:02:54.700> emphasis<00:02:54.910> on

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
there will be a bit more emphasis on

acts<00:04:38.810> during<00:04:39.140> that<00:04:39.410> period<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.250> aim<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.640> that

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
acts during that period the aim is that

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.360 
acts during that period the aim is that
you<00:04:41.000> learn<00:04:41.240> more<00:04:41.510> all<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.930> time<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:43.100> in<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
you learn more all the time so in the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.790 
you learn more all the time so in the
beginning<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:44.030> yes<00:04:44.540> quite<00:04:44.900> basic<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.590> could

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
beginning it's yes quite basic you could

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.820 
beginning it's yes quite basic you could
say<00:04:46.010> passing<00:04:46.970> heading<00:04:47.510> dribbling<00:04:48.170> etc

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
say passing heading dribbling etc

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.550 
say passing heading dribbling etc
shooting<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.610> then<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.510> gets<00:04:50.690> more<00:04:50.840> tactical

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
shooting and then it gets more tactical

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.590 
shooting and then it gets more tactical
and<00:04:52.040> there's<00:04:52.400> more<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.610> more<00:04:52.910> emphasis<00:04:53.270> on

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and there's more and more emphasis on

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.140 
and there's more and more emphasis on
playing<00:04:53.930> together<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:55.220> there's<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.940> whole

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
playing together so there's a whole

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.570 
playing together so there's a whole
learning<00:04:56.420> plan<00:04:56.870> behind<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.470> where<00:04:58.220> for<00:04:58.400> each

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
learning plan behind it where for each

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.000 
learning plan behind it where for each
age<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.360> say<00:04:59.630> well<00:05:00.170> at<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.650> end<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.920> the
