00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.209
 but not all and welcome do not forget 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.100
 the channel and as always is a new 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.570
 video and good background gameplay people 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.820
 first of all they will be seeing a part 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.410
 in software 3 before dawn 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.030
 'floors degree be because those are the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 retro lancer good is the theme of the video 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.910
 has to do has a lot to do with what 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.560
 that I will be talking about in the video and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 I would like to give you a game so that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.900
 see how castrating it can get 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 affect or good without rushing me a little 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.070
 first of all I hope you are very well and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 Well, let's start with the video 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.790
 Recently 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.309
 like after all the chaos that 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.260
 there was in the software george meant this is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 has taken all the players have 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.930
 taken the option to return to the software 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 3 that already has a good time be by 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.330
 month and then when March already has 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 joyce well did not last for three months and that 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.130
 will have half a year or so this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 that we emigrated again to gears of war 3 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.259
 and it was always good 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.229
 people that new in gears of war and everything 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.630
 this roll and you always found yourself at 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.850
 people using retro lancer in the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 fast games was not expected us 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.329
 says good in the fast games 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.490
 usually people who are 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.319
 learning to play or is alone and good 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.680
 it is understood we want to use that weapon 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.170
 good is in the game this 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.520
 now so you have to do it is not my 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.830
 preferred weapon but hey there is 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.160
 then people have the freedom to 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.750
 use it but 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.340
 recently after what happened 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.240
 the ink that was not that they have 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.410
 updated the board simply 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.990
 they removed the servers from 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.420
 updates as you would say 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.740
 ghosts or silent ones that do not 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 you had to download because simply 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.640
 they were updated on the server after 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.530
 there were many changes not between them 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.140
 the cropped because it returned to damage a 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.740
 little taken in the retro lancer equal 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.780
 and because of that every time 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.650
 because the use of this weapon was increased in 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.680
 in games quickly but lately and not 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.900
 so lately if it is not already 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.090
 it came back like that fashion and the weapon appears 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.239
 is in favorite and the software and nobody 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.890
 use nobody and nobody uses laser and nobody 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.330
 usa usa hummer 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.860
 obviously speaking hypothetically 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.360
 obviously there are people who use those weapons 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 just that every time I get up 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.200
 very much more retro lancer no longer the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.450
 I reminded people to use the remembered one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.520
 better is a second plane the retro 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.590
 lancer seems everyone's favorite weapon 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.830
 because now you find them even in 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.570
 even matches the most of this 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.340
 depressing and many will say good is that 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.290
 can be used to troll not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.690
 I say I already have all my medals I want 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.850
 get it out of the retro then it can be no 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.470
 It may be that you want to stick to 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.470
 trolling people in a game 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.870
 but it seems that it is the weapon 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.110
 competitive 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.860
 you get yourself and complete equipment that come 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.680
 together they have pure retro lancer and it is yes 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.320
 you know it is very difficult but 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.050
 very difficult to play against a team 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.460
 complete that uses inside throw and 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.470
 obviously without mentioning that it is 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.230
 completely unfortunate I the truth is 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.230
 it's so boring and the truth 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.250
 that the games are not given according to me 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 matched will be to take a little bit the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.830
 game more seriously this if you play 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.780
 competitive here will not try to not be 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.580
 spoiling people get to play a lot 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.050
 in teams you are alone and you get into 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.510
 play equal games then surely 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.160
 it's not going to be that simple, it's not that 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.870
 it is impossible to gain clear that yes there is 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.880
 players who play pretty well and what 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.440
 can do obviously depends a lot 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.810
 Whoever touches you never lacks the equipment that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.560
 you touch and it does not do anything worse than a button 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.430
 but but the theme that is the retro launches 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.780
 It was horrible if a person used it 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.730
 it's annoying but he can dodge it 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.310
 there are not many ways to play against that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.130
 Unfortunately, I have found a weapon 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.980
 some other way of playing against a 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.750
 complete team and you can do it because 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.519
 basically in case you can change it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.350
 you can take the quiet departure 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.570
 positioning in triangulating and all that 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.780
 but good at the end of accounts assists 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.669
 or more and under a lot also low cross 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.080
 the map that weapon is awesome I say 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.090
 If going down so low to be shortened 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.460
 distance but obviously not already 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.590
 problem for the update 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.780
 to the outdated that vault is 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.840
 weapons already under a lot again 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.080
 as its beginnings and well I do not know what happens 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.919
 with people because apart 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.020
 many many do it by their indexes 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.500
 and at this height that the index imports 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.990
 these are people who are said to be very 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.219
 competitive and here very very pro and you see it 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.969
 we want is using those weapons 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.590
 so I do not know what fart really 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 I would like someone to tell me if someone 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.590
 that's what the competitive one has 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.509
 they have changed the rules it is no longer 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.960
 pitcher is retro that I can not 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.729
 say be because every day is worse 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.240
 every day is worse every time I find myself 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.949
 more often these are these people teams 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.620
 complete and what is obviously you get 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.759
 one dragged and how can it be I'm going to 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.020
 say hey cause how can you 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.460
 to fight is to have a retro team 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.050
 lancer pongas of everything is retro lancer 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.479
 for the truth is that it is very boring 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.599
 play like this this one does not amuse me anything 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.300
 and my image is 5 against 5 pure retro 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.480
 5 retro are 35 remains because the truth to 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.970
 it does not appeal to me 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.500
 I obviously despair when they touch me 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.290
 parts like that but I 'm getting out 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.760
 of all the games 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.470
 I remain trying however 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.390
 it is always very difficult is too much 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.700
 difficult I tell you when a whole team 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.640
 has retro lancer is extremely nefarious 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.290
 It is extremely boring and I do not know what happens 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.530
 because then the games end and 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.290
 times are computers that have the index 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.670
 no longer seems that as you already saw 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.700
 who kill with that mother because they no longer 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.530
 consult healthy way so I do not know 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.700
 people really do not know what fart and the 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.990
 software that's why they've seen that from 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.790
 suddenly the gears of war videos have 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.850
 lowered however they are going to return 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.140
 this I have played many verses for 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.850
 three for that kind of thing but hey 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.830
 I will try to play a little more in 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.750
 teams to start with people to for 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.190
 minimum to fight it and then you will see 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.480
 the one other game that the stress that 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.930
 they will see that the opposing team will 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.060
 puts it like that of pig and so nothing people 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.070
 after taste the video seriously this one 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.990
 It is not like to throw the game or 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.880
 nothing else is a question whether fart 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.800
 with the players right now of this my 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.820
 doubt cava has changed the rules I do not think 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.860
 I 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.900
 but definitely if you are one of those 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.690
 people this 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.120
 what do you like to do that weapon then good 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.639
 I do not criticize you I'm not part of that 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.500
 I like it but good if you're at least 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.620
 those people the same and why not if 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.360
 it's because of your index oo what a roll there is 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.009
 if the missives bis all and with our 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.289
 people who use it and always at full 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.990
 since we went down we're going to get 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.160
 a game is not that they already use it 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.470
 and very good people I think so 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.880
 let's leave the video of today this is not 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.009
 they usually leave online in the video if they 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.150
 I liked it a long time ago that I did not 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.350
 videos like that but good I think that 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.080
 we suddenly need so that the 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.729
 people say 20 fart and then they owe us 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.310
 leave a like not a comment that is 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.690
 very important in this type of videos 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.639
 that more than anything for that I do the 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.460
 to see their comments and what they think at 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.660
 respect and then do not forget
