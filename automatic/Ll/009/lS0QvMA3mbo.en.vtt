accuracy<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.550> I<00:04:55.970> want<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:57.260> really<00:04:57.950> want<00:04:58.700> too

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
accuracy so I want to I really want too

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.950 
accuracy so I want to I really want too
much<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.300> really<00:04:59.510> to<00:05:00.290> watch<00:05:00.470> what<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.800> around

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.420 

here<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.140> focus<00:05:06.470> more<00:05:06.650> on<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.890> 4-position

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
here you focus more on the 4-position

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.610 
here you focus more on the 4-position
the<00:05:07.910> power<00:05:08.090> 4<00:05:09.280> yeah<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:11.500> think<00:05:12.500> that

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
the power 4 yeah I think I think that

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.010 
the power 4 yeah I think I think that
gameplay<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:13.010> can<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.520> think<00:05:13.730> we<00:05:14.060> both<00:05:14.240> know

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
gameplay I can be I think we both know

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.560 
gameplay I can be I think we both know
you'll<00:05:15.320> see
