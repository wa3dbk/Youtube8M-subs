00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
just a really good bike all-around we

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.340 
just a really good bike all-around we
really<00:00:50.070> really<00:00:50.429> liked<00:00:50.609> it<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.869> year<00:00:52.140> for

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310 
really really liked it and this year for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
2013 because our he decided to stick

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.569 
2013 because our he decided to stick
with<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.859> and<00:00:56.159> they've<00:00:56.309> kept

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
with what they know and they've kept

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
with what they know and they've kept
things<00:00:56.760> pretty<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:57.119> the<00:00:57.269> same<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.409> only

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
things pretty much the same and the only

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.919 
things pretty much the same and the only
changes<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.519> see<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.729> white<00:01:00.659> rear

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
changes that you can see a white rear

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.100 
changes that you can see a white rear
guard<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:02.250> ear<00:01:02.399> fork<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:03.299> here<00:01:03.479> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
guard and the ear fork over here it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
guard and the ear fork over here it's
slightly<00:01:04.559> different<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.429> the<00:01:05.580> Honda

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
slightly different to what the Honda

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.020 
slightly different to what the Honda
runs<00:01:06.149> on<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.509> this<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.530> runs<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.009> 35<00:01:08.520> psi

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
runs on this this one here runs a 35 psi

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
runs on this this one here runs a 35 psi
is<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.479> standard<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.409> bit

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
is your standard just a little bit

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.499 
is your standard just a little bit
harder<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.039> Honda<00:01:11.429> and<00:01:11.610> they've<00:01:12.360> also

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
harder than the Honda and they've also

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.630 
harder than the Honda and they've also
tuned<00:01:12.929> down<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.289> engine<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.679> little<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.039> just

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
tuned down the engine a little bit just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
tuned down the engine a little bit just
to<00:01:14.789> you<00:01:15.569> know<00:01:15.600> make<00:01:15.840> sure<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.140> anyone<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to you know make sure that anyone can

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.240 
to you know make sure that anyone can
ride<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.970 

with<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.300> air<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:25.900> took<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.650> for<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.860> we

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
with the air we took it for it we

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.290 
with the air we took it for it we
took<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.250> bike<00:01:27.400> for<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> bit<00:01:27.760> of<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.910> ride<00:01:28.060> and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
took the bike for a bit of a ride and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.120 
took the bike for a bit of a ride and
and<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.200> had<00:01:29.350> all<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> settings<00:01:30.010> on

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
and just had all the settings on

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.370 
and just had all the settings on
standard<00:01:30.630> including<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.140> mapping

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
standard including the in mapping

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.500 
standard including the in mapping
setting<00:01:32.770> as<00:01:32.860> well<00:01:33.010> it's<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.880> funny<00:01:34.090> thing<00:01:34.180> this

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
setting as well it's a funny thing this

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.470 
setting as well it's a funny thing this
bike<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:35.260> really<00:01:35.980> balanced<00:01:36.520> when<00:01:37.150> you're<00:01:37.300> in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
bike it's really balanced when you're in

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.060 
bike it's really balanced when you're in
the<00:01:37.600> corners<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.380> you're<00:01:38.530> having<00:01:38.740> bumps

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
the corners and and you're having bumps

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.580 
the corners and and you're having bumps
and<00:01:39.220> jumps<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.520> stuff<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:40.570> just<00:01:40.900> feels<00:01:41.110> like

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and jumps and stuff it just feels like

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.530 
and jumps and stuff it just feels like
it's<00:01:41.950> doing<00:01:42.400> what<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:42.670> wants<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.300> doing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
it's doing what it wants to be doing

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's doing what it wants to be doing
it's<00:01:43.960> not<00:01:44.170> trying<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.500> fight<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:45.100> all<00:01:45.280> so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
it's not trying to fight you at all so

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's not trying to fight you at all so
the<00:01:46.720> result<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.230> it<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.890> course<00:01:48.010> it's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the result of it is of course it's

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.760 
the result of it is of course it's
easier<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.730> write<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.510> feels<00:01:49.750> some<00:01:50.470> reason

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
easier to write and it feels some reason

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.650 
easier to write and it feels some reason
it<00:01:50.860> feels<00:01:51.070> quite<00:01:51.220> light<00:01:51.520> just<00:01:52.150> because<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.540> all

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
it feels quite light just because of all

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.160 
it feels quite light just because of all
that<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.030> tested<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.630> couple<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.080> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
that so I tested a couple of the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260 
that so I tested a couple of the
different<00:01:59.200> mapping<00:01:59.830> settings<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.369> started<00:02:01.150> off

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
different mapping settings I started off

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.240 
different mapping settings I started off
with<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.540> standard<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.260> I<00:02:02.290> found<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.010> up

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
with the standard and I found that up

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.770 
with the standard and I found that up
top<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.760> higher<00:02:03.940> revs<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.420> was<00:02:04.570> just

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
top and the higher revs it was just

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.260 
top and the higher revs it was just
didn't<00:02:05.229> feel<00:02:05.440> quite<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.010> my<00:02:06.040> sitting<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.729> we

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
didn't feel quite to my sitting so we

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.669 
didn't feel quite to my sitting so we
went<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.630> more<00:02:07.780> aggressive<00:02:08.020> mapping<00:02:08.560> in

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
went to the more aggressive mapping in

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.460 
went to the more aggressive mapping in
India<00:02:09.520> course<00:02:09.820> it's<00:02:10.060> just<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:11.080> thing<00:02:11.290> just

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
India course it's just this thing just

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.410 
India course it's just this thing just
reads<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.520> moon<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.150> keeps

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
reads to the moon but it just keeps

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.790 
reads to the moon but it just keeps
pulling<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.170> even<00:02:14.410> when<00:02:14.530> you're<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.740> there

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
pulling you even when you're up there

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.340 
pulling you even when you're up there
and<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.240> really<00:02:16.570> like<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> power<00:02:17.050> out

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.080 
of it gives you a bit of an idea of how
hard<00:02:47.140> these<00:02:47.320> sports<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.890> go<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.910> course

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
hard these sports can go and of course

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.090 
hard these sports can go and of course
they're<00:02:49.269> still<00:02:49.450> forgiving<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:50.560> everything<00:02:50.980> up

they're still forgiving in everything up
to<00:02:51.220> that

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470

personally I'm really stoked with the
detailing<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:09.020> I've<00:03:09.410> gone<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.830> white

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010

card as compared to the black which i

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.840

the<00:04:06.260> setup<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.920> bike<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:08.209> felt<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.870> did

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
the setup of the bike it felt it did

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080 
the setup of the bike it felt it did
feel<00:04:09.350> really<00:04:09.380> balanced<00:04:10.130> in<00:04:10.220> central<00:04:10.610> say<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
feel really balanced in central say and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.360 
feel really balanced in central say and
combined<00:04:11.989> with<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.200> power<00:04:12.440> it<00:04:12.770> just<00:04:13.070> it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
combined with the power it just it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.979 
combined with the power it just it
didn't<00:04:13.670> make<00:04:13.760> for<00:04:13.940> an<00:04:14.030> easy<00:04:14.180> easy<00:04:14.600> bike<00:04:14.870> to

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
didn't make for an easy easy bike to

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.430 
didn't make for an easy easy bike to
write<00:04:15.200> as<00:04:16.160> compared<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.810> few<00:04:17.810> years<00:04:17.840> ago<00:04:18.109> and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
write as compared to a few years ago and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.530 
write as compared to a few years ago and
it<00:04:18.620> was<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.770> little<00:04:19.040> bit<00:04:19.220> more<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.489> handful<00:04:19.850> so

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
it was a little bit more of a handful so

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.870 
it was a little bit more of a handful so
when<00:04:20.840> you've<00:04:20.959> got<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.169> combination<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.950> power

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
when you've got the combination of power

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.640 
when you've got the combination of power
that<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:23.450> pulls<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.840> out<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.290> corners

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
that really pulls you out the corners

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.770 
that really pulls you out the corners
and<00:04:24.830> really<00:04:25.160> easy<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.640> then<00:04:26.360> you've<00:04:26.480> got<00:04:26.630> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
and really easy and then you've got the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.420 
and really easy and then you've got the
handling<00:04:27.140> which<00:04:27.350> makes<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.770> bike<00:04:27.980> feel<00:04:28.220> nice

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
handling which makes the bike feel nice

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.970 
handling which makes the bike feel nice
and<00:04:28.640> light<00:04:28.790> now<00:04:29.570> you've<00:04:30.200> got<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.680> give<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.919> a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
and light now you've got to give it a
