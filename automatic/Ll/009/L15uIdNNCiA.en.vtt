I'm<00:02:20.650> not<00:02:20.890> really<00:02:21.100> sure<00:02:21.220> what<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.940> approach<00:02:22.330> is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
I'm not really sure what the approach is

I'm not really sure what the approach is
on<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.650> seems<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.280> though<00:02:24.310> they're

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
on this it seems as though they're

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.520 
on this it seems as though they're
trying<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> manifest<00:02:25.420> Ganga<00:02:26.020> but<00:02:26.380> that's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
trying to manifest Ganga but that's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.750 
trying to manifest Ganga but that's
pretty<00:02:26.770> much<00:02:26.890> what<00:02:27.190> happened<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.670> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
pretty much what happened with the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.880 
pretty much what happened with the
evolution<00:02:28.180> between<00:02:28.300> ghastly<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.320> haunting

evolution between ghastly and haunting

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.640 
evolution between ghastly and haunting
maybe<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.030> could<00:02:31.210> be<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.450> he's<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:32.080> don't<00:02:32.350> know

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
maybe it could be that he's I don't know
