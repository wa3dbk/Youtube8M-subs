00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.830
 Russian air defense systems with-300 were 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.200
 delivered to the series last week 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.940
 contrary to the promises of the Kremlin to refrain from 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.210
 sales think so little known 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 American wnt edition but refers to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 Arabic intelligence source 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 countries turn in the intelligence services of israel 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 this information does not confirm 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 say that the theme of the Russian supply 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 defensive weapons in syria sounds 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.250
 all the last days along with the discussion 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 problems of use in the mixer important 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.019
 country chemical weapons and weekends 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 American media reported that Damascus 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.059
 Moscow began to transfer 900 million 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 dollars for 6 launchers and almost 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 150 s-300 missiles 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 this became known shortly after 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 how israel struck on syrian 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 capitals by the way u syria lately 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 there are enough reasons to strengthen the baron's regime 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.539
 Asad has finally ruined his relationship with 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.530
 turkey you who were accused renzi in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.210
 Saturday terrorist attack 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 republican congressman lips 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.680
 john akino demanded obama introduce 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.260
 on oxy or fly zone as well 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 start delivering heavy weapons 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.659
 the enemy of Bashar al-Assad 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.760
 and the events in Syria around her we and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 talk with Ruslana plump director 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.150
 center for the analysis of strategies and technologies he 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 now rbk is here because 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 hotel ararat hyatt ruslan nikolaevich 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 Now we are preparing a world conference 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.140
 which agreed here is Russia and the United States as 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 rate the chances of success you know i 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.479
 I think that the chances of success are not very high 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 because it is clear that Bashar 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.579
 Assad and the regime of the series is ready for 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.770
 negotiations, the opposition dry and I 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.500
 which Saudi Arabia and Turkey to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.560
 this is not ready and it can be 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.740
 successful only if the Americans change 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.960
 your point of view is to say come back 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 to the position of common sense but the chances of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 it's not very high and yet here on 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.689
 your view is Syrian conflict he has 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.030
 peaceful solution or wait for war know 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.620
 all the same, too much blood was shed with 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.770
 both sides therefore I think that the world 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.800
 complete the unlikely probably 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.480
 the international community might 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.070
 do some large-scale operation on 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 Pasifika tion drag the assurance that 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.050
 territory but for this to be 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.880
 Consent of all stakeholders 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.910
 reach consensus i think is impossible 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.290
 the situation is now about a third 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.320
 population of the country strongly supports 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.720
 Assad's third is about against and third is 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.020
 such a kind of swamp but would not want 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.440
 see in power not astana opposition this 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.710
 Of course such a stalemate I 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 I think it will inevitably lead with time 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.670
 to split syria into several pieces along 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.620
 ethnoconfessional y sign but here 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.210
 if we talk about the west, then it is generally here 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.980
 invasion need here are many analysts 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.900
 saying that the situation is now a series 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.410
 evolving from under the Iraq scenario there 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.630
 found 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.540
 nuclear weapons in swamp cancer 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.520
 weapons you know i don't think that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.060
 security of israel or united 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.709
 States became 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.650
 that security has become more that they 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.360
 began to feel calmer after 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.330
 how they changed the mode 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.170
 in baghdad and after they invaded 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.470
 to afghanistan 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.570
 but often the one who is strong he 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.480
 revels in his strength and loses sound 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.580
 sense and i think the united states and 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.910
 their so-called allies such as 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.910
 turkey qatar are an example of this they 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.250
 still bitterly regret that they 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.890
 do now like they used to be bitter 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 regretted supporting 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.470
 Islamists 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.930
 against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.770
 when these Islamists sent weapons 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.340
 against them but it will be later 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.230
 commented on the situation around 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.060
 Russian s-300 officially butter 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.940
 discuss that the sale is stopped 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.600
 West from Western media write what you 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.100
 not like selling or not at all expensive 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.930
 you know really a few years 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.880
 ago the series was contracted to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.370
 delivery with-300 but then russia 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.200
 suspended its execution on the whole 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.239
 For several reasons, I do not exclude that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.959
 under pressure from the united states and 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.820
 israel is quite possible now russia and 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.410
 Syria 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.690
 agreed to renew this contract and 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.040
 quite possible after some time these 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.040
 deliveries will begin with what actually 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.770
 speaking and related hysteria western countries 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.840
 and Israel however in my opinion that money 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.750
 which bashar asad will spend on this 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.940
 system he can find them much better 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.830
 application to carry purchasing lung 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.950
 small arms bribing some 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.000
 field commanders strengthening their positions 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.880
 on the ground 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.340
 still the main threat to the garden 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.650
 come not from israel at least 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.690
 so far from those terrorists who 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.990
 penetrate jordanian turkish 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.320
 border and loosen its mode 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.870
 terrorizing carry 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.600
 Syrian citizens therefore it seems to me that 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.480
 if this delivery is not bashar asad 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.610
 not much lose expelled seems to me 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.680
 thanks for the direct link stukt bkt in 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.690
 hotel ararat ha i was director of the center 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.780
 analysis of strategies and technologies and ruslan 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.780
 Pooh
