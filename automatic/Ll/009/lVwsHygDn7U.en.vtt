00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
here this line right here can use that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.710 
here this line right here can use that
this<00:02:38.190> thing<00:02:38.459> doesn't<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.910> any<00:02:39.060> parts<00:02:39.630> we

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
this thing doesn't have any parts we

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840 
this thing doesn't have any parts we
plan<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.989> out<00:02:40.019> there<00:02:40.230> needs<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.040> there

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
plan it out there needs it more so there

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030 
plan it out there needs it more so there
we<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.209> yeah<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.380> one's<00:02:43.709> not<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> little

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
we go yeah so I this one's not a little

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.490 
we go yeah so I this one's not a little
bit<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.489> truck<00:02:44.819> tough<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.420> did<00:02:46.319> not

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
bit a little bit truck tough I did not

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020 
bit a little bit truck tough I did not
plant<00:02:46.739> those<00:02:46.890> down<00:02:47.069> as<00:02:47.280> quick<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.580> possible<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
plant those down as quick as possible I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
plant those down as quick as possible I
wanted<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.329> see<00:02:48.570> what<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.170> layout<00:02:49.769> was

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
wanted to see what the layout was

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.410 
wanted to see what the layout was
looking<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.519> really<00:02:50.880> should<00:02:51.030> just<00:02:51.060> plant

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
looking like I really should just plant

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.699 
looking like I really should just plant
any<00:02:51.570> stuff<00:02:51.810> down<00:02:51.989> right<00:02:52.019> away<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.590> would

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
any stuff down right away that would

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.830 
any stuff down right away that would
probably<00:02:52.890> we've<00:02:53.100> got<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> better<00:02:53.459> plan<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.750> now

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
probably we've got a better plan but now

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.240 
probably we've got a better plan but now
we<00:02:54.900> clean<00:02:55.140> off<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.410> way<00:02:55.560> looks<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.100> we're

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
we clean off the way looks like we're

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.880 
we clean off the way looks like we're
probably<00:02:56.730> gonna<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.120> okay<00:02:57.360> at<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.540> point

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
probably gonna be okay at this point

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.670 
probably gonna be okay at this point
we'll<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.280> ton<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> fire<00:03:00.420> damage<00:03:01.260> anymore

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
we'll have a ton of fire damage anymore

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.229 
we'll have a ton of fire damage anymore
we'd<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> lot<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.250> firepower<00:03:02.519> most<00:03:03.150> of

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
we'd have a lot of firepower most of
