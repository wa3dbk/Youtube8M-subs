 a 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.960
 mccain and a lot 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.970
 pay 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.709
 we are here in a program 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.029
 special 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.479
 dedicates a theme that brings us all together 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.069
 after release 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.320
 the nascar 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 wait is a bad word that because you put me the pir 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.449
 a subject that all interested 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.940
 the insecurity does not throw bales 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.499
 we are here with him but there is also such 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.280
 postulating for president and us 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480
 we want to ask 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.840
 what would you do with that scourge that is the university the insecurity for the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.330
 security insecurity 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.200
 surprises insecurity is a very important issue about Mendez the most 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.170
 important for him on matters to move forward for our society and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 not like for the whole planet I think there is or are ending 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.420
 a terrible paralysis in people caused fear ump true fear to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.289
 act does not understand me I think that insecurity is what does not allow us 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.750
 grow as a society people should be a little more sure of themselves 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 should be able to move forward without stalling 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.539
 lose that fear to water yourself but you know to associate little of the 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.049
 apple tree one do not have to hold on 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.450
 universalism is completely destroyed by relativity and what 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.539
 is fine and what is wrong when the moral begins to be a construction 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.100
 social why choose one thing the end is not choose the rest not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.580
 then one loses loses the possibilities when opting yahir light 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.610
 it did not rise very strong so I promise a long-term plan 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.419
 to end all kinds of insecurity, let's talk about a 

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:47.539
 social insecurity isaac we talk about ending a sexual insecurity by 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.530
 example health completely eradicate all complexes the complexes of 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.899
 uptake the complexes of the ipod the complexes also filippo and the two what 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.139
 dance complex not because there is no worse complex with dance complex with 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.100
 cache n merequetengue 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.810
 Carlos Paz 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 but I like it like 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.340
 how do you intend to do this thing that you propose 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.430
 as the literary humanitarian party that is handing out plans another city 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.750
 no not at all not that those plans in the funny plan e do not help anyone are 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.730
 simply a placebo that does not really remove the insecurity of the people but 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.710
 that sink her 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.820
 ignorant centrism ego that is based on the exaggeration of optimistic premises and 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.480
 the hiding of the tragic rae we aim a more plan 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.579
 consistent 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.540
 based on him 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.049
 pensionazo pessimism as a foundation to be realistic and face the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.269
 limitations of man we would be giving courses all over the country counting 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.099
 with material to support the philosopher like kirkegaard sartre mp3 jpg 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.030
 in your opinion, you deserve the left-wing quantum party 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 going down they make certain quantum theories of parallel universes says 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.030
 that any action we take is valid because we are reviewing all 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.889
 the possibilities at the same time in different universals 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.200
 its mediocre those means is the intellectual's desire or id 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.800
 the left because it exists as the theory of the strings to see where from 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.400
 an agreement that talks about James gravity and at the most took it for it 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.840
 accepted but has asked for more ed that they are going to skip the rope and that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.760
 will improve and now in charge of the game left much richer and now 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.810
 Vienna warms up well now but and the insecurity and the means of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.209
 communication which do you think the relationship between all elements or I think 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.910
 that the mass media media are not a terrible propagator 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.690
 of this evil that insecurity does not because there is no 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.420
 worst thing but my insurance to have 120 channels to choose lecuna goes into a 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.260
 vicious circle of zapping where fear akhtar does not let us leave a channel 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.059
 because we are going to market tamos changing in others i 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.099
 there is a fear of being wrong I did not 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.159
 but for that in the family climate cpo they fight over the remote control 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.059
 only to see it options not to choose them i 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.290
 and this goes from the television to the living 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.549
 eye to the room will be as they say in North American 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.230
 and one does not know what to say 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.359
 to be paralyzed pagani 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.859
 they are like the beethoven theme paralyzes 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.859
 pull apart 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.729
 It will be hard 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.189
 we go to a round 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.139
 last moment there is nothing to do said confirmed 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.180
 at one turns there a robe backpack in the capital of Chaco 1
