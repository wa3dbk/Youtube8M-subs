power<00:01:54.980> blender<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.580> wouldn't<00:01:55.820> even<00:01:55.880> have<00:01:56.180> to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
power blender you wouldn't even have to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.600 
power blender you wouldn't even have to
do<00:01:56.480> that<00:01:56.750> that's<00:01:57.650> right<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.100> could<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:58.430> use

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
do that that's right you could just use

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.370 
do that that's right you could just use
the<00:01:58.760> whole<00:01:58.909> cucumber<00:01:59.180> skin<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.930> all<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.320> a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
the whole cucumber skin and all and a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.170 
the whole cucumber skin and all and a
high-powered<00:02:00.950> blender<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:02.030> a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
high-powered blender like this in a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.060 
high-powered blender like this in a
regular<00:02:02.360> blender<00:02:02.570> you're<00:02:03.260> better<00:02:03.530> off<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.890> cut

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
regular blender you're better off to cut

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.830 
regular blender you're better off to cut
things<00:02:04.280> up<00:02:04.460> smaller<00:02:04.820> then<00:02:05.360> we<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.630> some

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
things up smaller then we have some

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.290 
things up smaller then we have some
parsley<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:07.400> now<00:02:07.580> we're<00:02:07.729> using<00:02:08.030> parsley

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
parsley and now we're using parsley

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.660 
parsley and now we're using parsley
today<00:02:08.659> but<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.080> also<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:10.009> dill<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
today but I also really like dill and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
high-powered blender you don't need to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220

do that and if you don't have kale you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.960 
do that and if you don't have kale you
can<00:02:26.380> use<00:02:26.500> any<00:02:26.770> kind<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.100> green<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.640> want

ingredient which is our avocado but
we're<00:02:39.370> going<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.520> wait<00:02:39.730> till<00:02:39.940> after<00:02:39.970> we<00:02:40.450> blend

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
it up a suit to add that right on and I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.160 
it up a suit to add that right on and I
blended<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.390> enough<00:02:52.660> for<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.870> green

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
blended it just enough for the green

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.490 
blended it just enough for the green
flecks<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.709> kale<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.250> disappear<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:56.230> while

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
flecks of kale to disappear now while

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.020 
flecks of kale to disappear now while
you're<00:02:56.680> cutting<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.130> avocado<00:02:57.490> down<00:02:58.000> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you're cutting up that avocado down I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.640 
you're cutting up that avocado down I
just<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.600> mention<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.050> reason<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.530> we

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
just want to mention the reason that we

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.460 
just want to mention the reason that we
leave<00:03:00.160> avvocato<00:03:00.760> or<00:03:01.000> any<00:03:01.209> fat<00:03:01.660> source<00:03:02.020> until

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
leave avvocato or any fat source until

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.640 
leave avvocato or any fat source until
the<00:03:02.770> end<00:03:03.000> processing<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.170> tends<00:03:05.500> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the end processing is that it tends to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.150 
the end processing is that it tends to
get<00:03:05.890> fluffy<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.880> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> foamy<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.920> also

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
get fluffy and kind of foamy it also

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.730 
get fluffy and kind of foamy it also
oxidizes<00:03:10.120> more<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.570> it's<00:03:10.720> always<00:03:11.200> best<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.560> add

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
oxidizes more so it's always best to add

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.480 
oxidizes more so it's always best to add
your<00:03:12.010> fat<00:03:12.220> at<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> end<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.890> avocado<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.250> one

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
your fat at the end and avocado is one

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.830 
your fat at the end and avocado is one
of<00:03:15.610> those<00:03:15.760> things<00:03:16.030> that's<00:03:16.270> just<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.750> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
of those things that's just a it's a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.230 
of those things that's just a it's a
good<00:03:17.050> fat<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.620> adds<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:18.010> nice<00:03:18.160> lusciousness<00:03:18.820> and

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
good fat it adds a nice lusciousness and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.690 
good fat it adds a nice lusciousness and
binds<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.410> soup<00:03:20.620> together<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.580> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
binds the soup together so that the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.729 
binds the soup together so that the
fibers<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.390> liquids<00:03:22.780> don't<00:03:22.989> separate<00:03:23.470> it

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
fibers and the liquids don't separate it

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.949 
fibers and the liquids don't separate it
really<00:03:24.100> does<00:03:24.280> add<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.550> nice<00:03:24.970> creamy<00:03:25.570> mouthfeel

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
really does add a nice creamy mouthfeel

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.620 
really does add a nice creamy mouthfeel
as<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.680> well<00:03:27.010> if<00:03:27.489> you're<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.790> lower<00:03:28.060> fat<00:03:28.300> diet

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
as as well if you're on a lower fat diet

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.509 
as as well if you're on a lower fat diet
you<00:03:28.900> want<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.170> might<00:03:29.560> want<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.070> add<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> little

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
you want to might want to add a little

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.330 
you want to might want to add a little
bit<00:03:30.730> less<00:03:31.000> dan<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.890> much<00:03:33.100> soup

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
bit less dan and I for this much soup

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.790 
bit less dan and I for this much soup
would<00:03:33.519> probably<00:03:33.910> add<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> whole<00:03:34.620> smaller

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
would probably add a whole smaller

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.770 
would probably add a whole smaller
avocado<00:03:36.430> which<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.209> size<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:37.420> we're

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
avocado which is the size that we're

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.290 
avocado which is the size that we're
we're<00:03:38.230> using<00:03:38.500> here<00:03:39.010> but<00:03:39.820> if<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:40.030> were<00:03:40.150> going<00:03:40.239> to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
we're using here but if I were going to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.850 
we're using here but if I were going to
eat<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.570> whole<00:03:40.720> suit<00:03:40.989> myself<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.590> probably

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
eat the whole suit myself I probably

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.090 
eat the whole suit myself I probably
would<00:03:42.100> only<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.610> added<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.030> half<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.860> now

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100
