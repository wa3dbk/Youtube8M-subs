hid<00:05:03.310> but<00:05:03.730> they<00:05:04.540> have<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.750> proper<00:05:05.110> housings

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
hid but they have the proper housings

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.960 
hid but they have the proper housings

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
that doesn't really blind people when

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.620 
that doesn't really blind people when
they<00:05:07.090> go<00:05:07.210> by

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630
