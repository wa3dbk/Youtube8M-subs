hello this is Alex and welcome to a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.679 
hello this is Alex and welcome to a
little<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:02.730> where<00:00:03.060> I'll<00:00:03.179> show<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
little video where I'll show you how to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.340 
little video where I'll show you how to
duplicate<00:00:04.560> these<00:00:05.370> powered<00:00:06.180> rails<00:00:06.720> here<00:00:06.990> which

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
duplicate these powered rails here which

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.870 
duplicate these powered rails here which
can<00:00:07.529> be<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.710> little<00:00:07.859> bit<00:00:08.040> expensive<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.700> make

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
can be a little bit expensive to make

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.100 
can be a little bit expensive to make
because<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.990> need<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> lot<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.440> gold

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
because you need a lot of gold

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.419 
because you need a lot of gold
this<00:00:13.110> works<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.590> single-player<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.370> in

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
this works in single-player and in

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.269 
this works in single-player and in
multiplayer<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.509> need<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:16.049> that

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
multiplayer and you need to know that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.240 
multiplayer and you need to know that
this<00:00:17.279> piston<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:17.789> needs<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
this piston here needs to be in the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.609 
this piston here needs to be in the
north<00:00:20.250> south<00:00:23.689> there<00:00:24.689> needs<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.140> pointing

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
north south there needs to be pointing

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
north south there needs to be pointing
north<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> south<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.460> will<00:00:26.699> not<00:00:26.849> work<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.269> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
north and south it will not work if you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.400 
north and south it will not work if you
put<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.369> need<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.199> get<00:00:31.199> rid<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
put it here so you need to get rid of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.520 
put it here so you need to get rid of
that<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:32.719> no<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.930> need<00:00:34.079> two<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.290> them

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that actually no we need two of them

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.280 
that actually no we need two of them
okay<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.899> build<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
okay so what you need to to build this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.819 
okay so what you need to to build this
is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:38.040> five<00:00:38.250> redstone<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.570> level<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.620> redstone

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
is a five redstone on level one redstone

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
is a five redstone on level one redstone
torch<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.610> sticky<00:00:41.850> pistons<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.510> repeaters

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
torch two sticky pistons two repeaters

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
torch two sticky pistons two repeaters
and<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.440> silly<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.340> sitting<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.850> one

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and a silly one up sitting or one

and a silly one up sitting or one
furnace<00:00:46.190> some<00:00:47.190> starter<00:00:47.610> powered<00:00:47.910> rails<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
furnace some starter powered rails so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.400 
furnace some starter powered rails so
just<00:00:48.870> make<00:00:49.020> six<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> three<00:00:49.920> blocks<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> we

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
just make six and three blocks so we

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.100 
just make six and three blocks so we
have<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lever<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.340> extends<00:00:54.110> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
have a lever here that extends this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
have a lever here that extends this
piston<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.219> block<00:00:56.489> moves<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> here

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
piston this block moves out to here

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
piston this block moves out to here
which<00:00:57.750> starts<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.440> clock<00:00:58.770> which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> one

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
which starts with a clock which is a one

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
which starts with a clock which is a one
tick<00:00:59.730> clock<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:03.719> sends<00:01:04.019> power<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
tick clock and that sends power to this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
tick clock and that sends power to this
piston<00:01:05.400> which<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:05.820> starts<00:01:06.479> moving<00:01:06.810> back<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
piston which then starts moving back and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770 
piston which then starts moving back and
forth<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.770> fast<00:01:08.150> then<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.299> jump<00:01:09.600> down

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
forth really fast then you jump down

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530 
forth really fast then you jump down
into<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.409> hole<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.610> hold<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.150> right

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
into this hole and you hold down right

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
into this hole and you hold down right
click<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.890> block<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.610> front<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:17.270> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
click on the block here in front and you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
click on the block here in front and you
can<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.110> inventory<00:01:19.619> how<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> rail

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
can see on my inventory how the the rail

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.840 
can see on my inventory how the the rail
gets<00:01:23.790> duplicated<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.009> leave<00:01:26.189> remove

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
gets duplicated you can leave remove

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
gets duplicated you can leave remove
this<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> over<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.380> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this from here put it over here it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.880 
this from here put it over here it
doesn't<00:01:28.619> matter<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:30.030> still<00:01:30.329> works<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
doesn't matter it still works and if you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
doesn't matter it still works and if you
don't<00:01:35.100> need<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.509> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
don't need this but if you don't have it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
don't need this but if you don't have it
you<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.220> mess<00:01:38.490> going

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you will have just have this mess going

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
you will have just have this mess going
on<00:01:38.939> behind<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.890> why<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> put

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
on behind here so that's why I put

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
on behind here so that's why I put
either<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.390> obsidian<00:01:42.689> block<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.259> or

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
either an obsidian block there or

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109 
either an obsidian block there or
furnace<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.340> block<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> can't<00:01:45.000> be

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
furnace or some block that can't be

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.560 
furnace or some block that can't be
moved<00:01:45.299> by<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> piston<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:47.090> need<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> tell<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
moved by a piston I need to tell you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.609 
moved by a piston I need to tell you
that<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.020> didn't<00:01:49.380> invent<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.740> machine<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.899> guy

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that I didn't invent this machine a guy

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.209 
that I didn't invent this machine a guy
from<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> server<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.490> play<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.950> he<00:01:55.950> found

this video on YouTube how to duplicate

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
this video on YouTube how to duplicate
these<00:02:00.270> powered<00:02:00.869> rails<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.130> played

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
these powered rails and we just played

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.149 
these powered rails and we just played
around<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.740> improved<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> Machine

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
around with it and improved the Machine

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.649 
around with it and improved the Machine
a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.280> bit<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.090> wanted<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> show
