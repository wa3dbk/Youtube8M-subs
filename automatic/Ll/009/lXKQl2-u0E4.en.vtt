00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.209
 I decided to make this video because I did not 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.690
 I got a video on YouTube 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:14.500
 satisfactory to describe the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 crate amplifier for guitar model 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 gx 65 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.840
 this amplifier is an amplifier 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.380
 65 watts and basically consists of two 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380
 channels 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.760
 a plan channel 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 whose volume is independent and also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.950
 has its independent equalizer by 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.450
 assumption of medium and high low sounds 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.180
 we can also observe to the right 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.990
 a river knob but this knob 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.520
 It is common for both this channel clean 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.450
 as for the overdrive channel 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.190
 but remember that the equalization and the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.600
 clean channel volume if it is 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 independent for this channel 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.659
 it was true channel has its volume 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 Independent 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.409
 you have an independent equalizer but 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.070
 only two bands 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:28.030
 for bass sounds and high sounds 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:33.320
 and has additionally a pair of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.540
 Profit 1 and Profit 2 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.840
 that the latter is associated with a 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.460
 shape effect which we will talk about in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.460
 a few moments 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.240
 the credit x 65 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.810
 comes 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.810
 with his suite which controls 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.730
 if we are going to work with the clean and he 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.800
 the overdrive sang 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.990
 in turn also serves to activate the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.250
 river 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.140
 when it is in overdrive it serves to 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.900
 select 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 with what profit we will work if 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.960
 Earnings 1 or Earnings 2 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.420
 gain 1 is 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.820
 much softer than gain 2 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.420
 let's say that gain 1 can be 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.400
 use for crunch type sounds a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.190
 little bit of distortion suddenly to rock 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.190
 and roll while gain 2 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.550
 mittal let's say it's stronger and it serves 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.360
 well for 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.360
 for sounds of strong rock 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:03.310
 next I am going to show you the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.310
 Credit performance x 65 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.400
 at this moment we do not have activated 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.670
 let's say no effect is on the channel 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.090
 click on the clinch under without any 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.110
 effect beyond the equalization that 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.110
 it's on average 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.299
 ah 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.040
 plus 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.970
 revel 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.910
 to 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 here 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.319
 ah 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.829
 ah 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.829
 ah 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.879
 do not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.879
 ah 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.060
 overdrive activated gain 1 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.180
 ah 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.950
 as well 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.280
 overdrive with gain 2 here 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.360
 LOL 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.060
 no no 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.180
 even more
