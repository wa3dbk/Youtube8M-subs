just trying to avoid the situation but

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.420 
just trying to avoid the situation but
if<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.380> would<00:06:31.590> have<00:06:31.680> happened<00:06:31.800> again

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
if it would have happened again

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.700

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
would have escalated and I mean it

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.470 
would have escalated and I mean it
wouldn't<00:06:35.100> probably<00:06:35.370> have<00:06:35.610> not<00:06:35.790> ended<00:06:36.300> well

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480
