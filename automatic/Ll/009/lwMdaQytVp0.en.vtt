00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.130
 I participate in rehearsals 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.220
 not the first year helped the past 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 graduates could also exist for me 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.790
 some difficulties i ca n't dance 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.489
 it's hard for me i was surprised when 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:42.000
 saw my school my friends and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.610
 saw them in the photos rang and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.770
 was glad for her almost studied the waltz 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.170
 but not yet the rest of the last 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.790
 the elements repeated sirtaki will be very 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.070
 easy as it was easy for everyone 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.530
 I remembered everything at once 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.830
 instagrame in contact in the group look 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.360
 like other schools at what stage are they like 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.360
 I would not stand up, I think so 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.820
 Well, I basically like ours 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.000
 rehearsal what a fan come to us 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.020
 regularly twice a week and 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 doing dancing we teach waltz now and 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.820
 drags us sirtaki since given 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 rehearsals take place after school us this 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.119
 does not interfere with studies 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.490
 other schools wonder what they are next 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.399
 study well, or expect something that will 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.659
 so interesting of course 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.969
 rehearsal given very well guys 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.950
 quickly delve into ourselves like that is 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.810
 a sea of ​​positive a sea ​​of ​​emotions us with a very 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.689
 like it happened so that the guy and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.390
 girl so a couple we have right away 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.219
 mastered very well and therefore no 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.869
 problems with this years subscribed to a group with 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.409
 With this for photos we look through every day 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.329
 photos 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.429
 this year I was lucky to be 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.530
 project choreographer in two cities at once 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.950
 it's in sterlitamak and and salavat 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.599
 I have probably spent so far 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.869
 rehearsal 15 that's for sure every one relates 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.189
 really serious about staging 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.019
 takes the spring project seriously 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.819
 Ball today for example 5 school 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.769
 literally in 1 hour well firstly 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.500
 remembered what they studied with 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.230
 their curators and very quickly did 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.349
 the most difficult element was dancing this 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.049
 square I think that graduates of 2015 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.600
 years are capable of making you big 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.459
 scale holiday like spring ball i 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.069
 I think that each of them will succeed 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 most importantly just wanting to do it 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.750
 everyone is waiting for this day 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.180
 September is not very funny to me 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.489
 such 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.950
 for the city for our holidays for everyone 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.629
 will be somehow 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 you do not know the incentive to gather all 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.340
 together last year but I liked it 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 last year very especially these balls 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.239
 when they were at the end 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.550
 but
