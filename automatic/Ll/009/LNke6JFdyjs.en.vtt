did it in my 3d desktop video too but um

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.200 
did it in my 3d desktop video too but um
I<00:00:21.710> try<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.070> tutorial<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> few<00:00:24.000> times

best I can well first thing you need to
know<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.680> move<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.399> done<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.090> split

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
know is this move is done from a split

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.740 
know is this move is done from a split
time<00:00:48.629> butterfly<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.059> able<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.360> split

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
time butterfly so you be able do split

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.410 
time butterfly so you be able do split
time<00:00:51.960> butterfly<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.010> forward<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.469> reverse

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
time butterfly and forward and reverse

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.520 
time butterfly and forward and reverse
split<00:00:57.420> time<00:00:57.629> butterfly<00:00:59.600> excuse<00:01:00.600> me<00:01:00.750> yeah<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
split time butterfly excuse me yeah I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.980 
split time butterfly excuse me yeah I
yeah<00:01:02.219> Enderman<00:01:03.059> um<00:01:03.600> Oh<00:01:06.560> see<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> kind

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
yeah Enderman um Oh see the way I kind

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
yeah Enderman um Oh see the way I kind
of<00:01:10.080> learned<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.640> was<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> start<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
of learned this was I just start out and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.890 
of learned this was I just start out and
split<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:12.990> butterfly<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.390> would

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
split time butterfly and then I would

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.980 
split time butterfly and then I would
just<00:01:16.350> basically<00:01:17.150> stall<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.390> dominant<00:01:18.960> hand

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
just basically stall my dominant hand

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.719 
just basically stall my dominant hand
first<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> its<00:01:21.270> stall<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.810> first<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
first so its stall that one first and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.380 
first so its stall that one first and
then<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:25.220> my<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.490> hand<00:01:26.820> reached<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
then right as my right hand reached the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.219 
then right as my right hand reached the
peak<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:28.020> its<00:01:28.829> stall<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> start

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
peak of its stall and I'm about to start

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.240 
peak of its stall and I'm about to start
pulling<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.770> I'd<00:01:32.070> stall<00:01:32.720> my<00:01:33.720> left<00:01:33.960> foot

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
pulling it down I'd stall my left foot

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
pulling it down I'd stall my left foot
so<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:38.780> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so it would kind of look like this and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
so it would kind of look like this and
you<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.490> few

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you might just want to do that for a few

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
you might just want to do that for a few
tries<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.810> timing<00:01:46.380> coordination

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
tries to get that timing coordination

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.260 
tries to get that timing coordination
right<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.680> stall<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.979> then<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.909> with

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
right so just to stall up then up with

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
right so just to stall up then up with
your<00:01:51.390> lips<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:53.340> about<00:01:53.490> doing<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
your lips and I think about doing this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
your lips and I think about doing this
move<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> time

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
move it's going to take a lot of time

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.230 
move it's going to take a lot of time
just<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.719> trial<00:01:57.719> an<00:01:57.930> era<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.350> getting<00:01:58.939> your<00:01:59.939> left

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
just a trial an era of getting your left

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.539 
just a trial an era of getting your left
boy<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> stall<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> correct<00:02:04.049> timing

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
boy to the stall on the correct timing

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.290 
boy to the stall on the correct timing
so<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.689> said<00:02:06.869> start<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:08.300> split

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so just like I said start out in split

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.699 
so just like I said start out in split
time<00:02:09.479> butterfly<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.459> right<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:11.879> left

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
time butterfly it's all right then left

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.069 
time butterfly it's all right then left
it's<00:02:14.709> all<00:02:14.829> right<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.250> left<00:02:15.459> just<00:02:16.180> once<00:02:16.450> up<00:02:16.750> in

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
it's all right then left just once up in

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:25.229 
it's all right then left just once up in
this<00:02:17.170> kind<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.439> love<00:02:17.590> them<00:02:17.680> fall<00:02:21.359> okay<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:25.090> when

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
this kind of love them fall okay so when

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.740 
this kind of love them fall okay so when
you<00:02:25.299> get<00:02:25.450> used<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.700> try<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
you get used to that you can try to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.509 
you get used to that you can try to
reverse<00:02:29.109> it<00:02:29.379> on<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.769> down<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> you're<00:02:33.430> going

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
reverse it on the down so you're going

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.190 
reverse it on the down so you're going
to<00:02:33.579> install<00:02:33.939> your<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:34.720> left<00:02:34.930> then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
to install your right then left then

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.349 
to install your right then left then
right<00:02:35.409> again<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.359> kind<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:39.359> do

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
right again and it's going to kind of do

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.629 
right again and it's going to kind of do
this<00:02:42.510> scoop<00:02:43.510> motion<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.859> then

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
this scoop motion like that and then

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.129 
this scoop motion like that and then
immediately<00:02:46.060> when<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.139> one<00:02:47.349> falls<00:02:48.030> down

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
immediately when this one falls down

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:56.280 
immediately when this one falls down
your<00:02:50.139> left<00:02:50.349> should<00:02:50.919> be<00:02:51.069> going<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:55.230> that's<00:02:56.230> the
