these are my paper bullets they're not
particularly<00:00:15.880> that<00:00:16.090> great<00:00:16.330> it's<00:00:16.509> just

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
particularly that great it's just

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
particularly that great it's just
something<00:00:17.590> that<00:00:17.860> I've<00:00:18.460> done<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:20.170> first<00:00:20.439> what

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
something that I've done so first what

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.920 
something that I've done so first what
you<00:00:20.650> want<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.890> do<00:00:22.470> cut<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:24.580> piece<00:00:25.480> of<00:00:25.539> paper<00:00:25.720> out

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
you want to do cut a piece of paper out

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.750 
you want to do cut a piece of paper out
what<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.650> what<00:00:26.830> your<00:00:26.980> size<00:00:27.449> size<00:00:28.449> you<00:00:28.660> want

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
what to what your size size you want

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.900 
what to what your size size you want
then<00:00:30.760> it's<00:00:31.359> easier<00:00:31.660> if<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.840> get<00:00:32.050> some<00:00:32.199> ink

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
then it's easier if you get some ink

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.430 
then it's easier if you get some ink
that<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:33.970> can<00:00:34.239> roll<00:00:34.840> all<00:00:35.080> your<00:00:35.260> bullets

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
that you can roll all your bullets

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.180 
that you can roll all your bullets
around<00:00:35.680> so<00:00:36.159> they're<00:00:37.030> always<00:00:37.180> about<00:00:37.870> same<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
around so they're always about same this

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.899 
around so they're always about same this
is<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.549> a<00:00:39.930> piece<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.080> coat<00:00:41.409> hanging<00:00:41.620> out<00:00:41.909> so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
is just a piece of coat hanging out so

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.070 
is just a piece of coat hanging out so
you<00:00:43.120> want<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.299> wrap<00:00:43.420> it<00:00:43.540> around<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.809> glue<00:00:43.900> it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
you want to wrap it around and glue it

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.170 
you want to wrap it around and glue it
and<00:00:44.229> leave<00:00:44.379> that<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.620> dry<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:44.860> it's<00:00:45.100> good<00:00:46.089> and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
and leave that to dry so it's good and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.890 
and leave that to dry so it's good and
solid<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:47.140> then<00:00:47.260> what<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.470> want<00:00:47.589> to<00:00:47.650> do<00:00:47.799> is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
solid and then what you want to do is

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.030 
solid and then what you want to do is
get<00:00:49.900> your<00:00:50.170> paper<00:00:50.970> get<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.000> piece<00:00:52.150> of<00:00:52.269> paper<00:00:56.040> that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
get your paper get a piece of paper that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.469 
get your paper get a piece of paper that
goes<00:00:57.280> I'm<00:00:57.940> gonna<00:00:58.150> say<00:00:58.299> about<00:00:58.470> that<00:00:59.470> far<00:00:59.710> up<00:01:00.479> all

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
goes I'm gonna say about that far up all

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.420 
goes I'm gonna say about that far up all
that<00:01:01.659> and<00:01:02.589> then<00:01:02.920> cut<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.400> cut<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.449> out<00:01:04.629> angle<00:01:05.560> so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
that and then cut it cut it out angle so

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.980 
that and then cut it cut it out angle so
slowly<00:01:07.440> get<00:01:08.440> smaller<00:01:08.770> as<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.250> goes<00:01:09.400> along<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
slowly get smaller as it goes along like

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.880 
slowly get smaller as it goes along like
that<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:17.020> smaller<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:20.530> what<00:01:20.830> you

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
that so it's smaller so then what you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.660 
that so it's smaller so then what you
want<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.040> do<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.340> wanna

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
want to do you wanna

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.580 
want to do you wanna
this<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:21.970> hard<00:01:22.240> bit<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.660> find<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.290> I'd<00:01:23.410> only

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
this is a hard bit I find it I'd only

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.500 
this is a hard bit I find it I'd only
just<00:01:24.570> wanna<00:01:25.590> rule<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.950> up<00:01:29.820> obviously<00:01:30.820> you'll

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
just wanna rule it up obviously you'll

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.570 
just wanna rule it up obviously you'll
glue<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:34.090> roll<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.540> first<00:01:34.870> so<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:36.420> gets

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
glue it just roll that first so it gets

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.820 
glue it just roll that first so it gets
so<00:01:39.580> this<00:01:39.730> is<00:01:39.790> what<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.030> should<00:01:40.060> look<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.830> when

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
so this is what it should look like when

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.860 
so this is what it should look like when
it's<00:01:42.010> done

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760 

that's<00:01:47.340> next<00:01:48.340> what<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.760> want<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.909> do
