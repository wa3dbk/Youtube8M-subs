welcome to tutorial on beast conversion
by<00:00:02.790> word<00:00:03.030> x8<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:04.200> version<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.890> taught<00:00:05.730> in

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
by word x8 this version is taught in

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.639 
by word x8 this version is taught in
discrete<00:00:06.359> math<00:00:06.540> but<00:00:06.930> it<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.319> several

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
discrete math but it can have several

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.259 
discrete math but it can have several
different<00:00:07.890> implications<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.090> pretty

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
different implications and it's a pretty

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.610 
different implications and it's a pretty
useful<00:00:09.389> thing<00:00:09.570> overall<00:00:10.219> I<00:00:11.630> posted<00:00:12.630> this

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
useful thing overall I posted this

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.829 
useful thing overall I posted this
tutorial<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.429> my<00:00:14.519> website<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.150> written<00:00:15.480> form

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
tutorial on my website in written form

tutorial on my website in written form
so<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.830> wanted<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.970> can

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so if you wanted to see that you can

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
so if you wanted to see that you can
either<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.199> links<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.619> type<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:19.920> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
either these links you can type them in

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.380 
either these links you can type them in
the<00:00:20.039> URL<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:23.180> look<00:00:24.180> at<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the URL or you can look at the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.009 
the URL or you can look at the
description<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.680> get<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> URL<00:00:26.400> there

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
description and get it get the URL there

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.640 
description and get it get the URL there
there's<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.170> background<00:00:28.529> information

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there's some background information

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.389 
there's some background information
first<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.300> beast<00:00:30.720> 10<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
first of all we are beast 10 so if you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
first of all we are beast 10 so if you
see<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> number<00:00:32.809> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.170> plain

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
see a number if you just see plain

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.549 
see a number if you just see plain
number<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.890> no<00:00:34.920> base<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.290> assume<00:00:37.440> it's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
number with no base you can assume it's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.220 
number with no base you can assume it's
base<00:00:37.680> 10<00:00:37.820> otherwise<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.719> numbers<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.200> be

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
base 10 otherwise it's a numbers can be

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
base 10 otherwise it's a numbers can be
written<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> number<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.700> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
written as the number and then in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
written as the number and then in
subscripts<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.809> base<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.350> for

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
subscripts to be the base so for

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.479 
subscripts to be the base so for
instance<00:00:43.800> 10<00:00:44.309> 10<00:00:44.640> 10<00:00:44.910> base<00:00:45.780> 2<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> write<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
instance 10 10 10 base 2 you write it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.900 
instance 10 10 10 base 2 you write it
this<00:00:47.579> way<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.270> say<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.770> now<00:00:49.910> one

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
this way you say it this way now one

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.740 
this way you say it this way now one
major<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.809> different<00:00:52.260> bases<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.750> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
major thing about different bases is the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
major thing about different bases is the
value<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> each<00:00:55.440> digit<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:56.070> base<00:00:56.850> 10<00:00:57.770> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
value of each digit in base 10 the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
value of each digit in base 10 the
largest<00:00:59.190> number<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> 9<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
largest number you can have is 9 and you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
largest number you can have is 9 and you
get<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.289> busy<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.760> 1<00:01:02.760> minus<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.420> base<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
get that busy do 1 minus the base so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
get that busy do 1 minus the base so
base<00:01:04.140> 10<00:01:04.729> 10<00:01:05.729> minus<00:01:06.030> 1<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> 9<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.900> largest

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
base 10 10 minus 1 is 9 the largest

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
base 10 10 minus 1 is 9 the largest
value<00:01:07.439> an<00:01:07.710> individual<00:01:08.070> base<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.610> 9<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
value an individual base can be is 9 so

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
value an individual base can be is 9 so
for<00:01:09.810> instance<00:01:10.080> base<00:01:10.229> 3<00:01:10.680> could<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:12.560> 2222<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
for instance base 3 could have 2222 is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.719 
for instance base 3 could have 2222 is
gonna<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:16.890> largest<00:01:17.280> possible<00:01:17.430> ones

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
gonna be like when largest possible ones

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.770 
gonna be like when largest possible ones
could<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:20.310> base

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
could do is to that base

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.560 
could do is to that base
now<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.650> worth<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.430> than<00:01:24.330> base

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
now if did you is worth more than base

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.910 
now if did you is worth more than base
minus<00:01:24.960> 1<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
minus 1 then you have to you have to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
minus 1 then you have to you have to
carry<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.250> value<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> next<00:01:27.119> digit<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
carry that value over the next digit so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
carry that value over the next digit so
like<00:01:28.560> adding<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.610> 9<00:01:29.909> plus<00:01:30.329> 1

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like adding where we have like 9 plus 1

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
like adding where we have like 9 plus 1
carried<00:01:31.229> over<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> next<00:01:31.530> age<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> 10<00:01:32.009> same

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
carried over the next age of 10 same

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
carried over the next age of 10 same
thing<00:01:32.970> base<00:01:33.270> 3<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.560> add<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.689> 2222<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
thing base 3 if you add one to 2222 it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.609 
thing base 3 if you add one to 2222 it
would<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> 2<00:01:37.740> 2<00:01:38.009> 2<00:01:38.340> 3<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.840> 3<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
would be 2 2 2 3 this 3 would not be

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
would be 2 2 2 3 this 3 would not be
allowed<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.250> you'd<00:01:41.670> move<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> 3<00:01:42.270> over

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
allowed so then you'd move the 3 over

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
allowed so then you'd move the 3 over
here<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.320> 2<00:01:43.619> 2<00:01:44.399> 3<00:01:44.909> 0<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.950> keep

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
here you have 2 2 3 0 and then you keep

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
here you have 2 2 3 0 and then you keep
them<00:01:47.189> moving<00:01:47.280> 3<00:01:47.640> over<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.180> 2<00:01:48.600> 2<00:01:48.810> 2<00:01:49.140> 2<00:01:49.170> plus<00:01:49.740> 1

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
them moving 3 over so 2 2 2 2 plus 1

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.929 
them moving 3 over so 2 2 2 2 plus 1
equals<00:01:50.310> 10,000<00:01:52.070> now<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
equals 10,000 now if you if you have a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.050 
equals 10,000 now if you if you have a
digit<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.470> worth<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.159> 9<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
digit that is worth more than 9 and the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
digit that is worth more than 9 and the
base<00:01:57.240> allows<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> start<00:01:58.619> using

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
base allows it then you start using

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.819 
base allows it then you start using
capital<00:01:59.450> alphabetical<00:02:00.450> characters<00:02:00.869> instead

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
capital alphabetical characters instead

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.039 
capital alphabetical characters instead
of<00:02:02.009> numbers<00:02:02.310> off<00:02:02.670> those<00:02:03.390> digits<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.869> they're

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
of numbers off those digits if they're

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749 
of numbers off those digits if they're
worth<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.439> than<00:02:04.560> 9<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.579> case

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
worth more than 9 and then in that case

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.320 
worth more than 9 and then in that case
you'd<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.240> A's<00:02:06.479> or<00:02:06.509> 10<00:02:07.020> B's<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.560> 11<00:02:07.890> etc

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
you'd use like A's or 10 B's with 11 etc

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
you'd use like A's or 10 B's with 11 etc
now<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> value<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.319> number

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
now if you get the value of a number

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.720 
now if you get the value of a number
this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> how<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.380> all<00:02:13.590> take<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
this is how you do it you all take the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.950 
this is how you do it you all take the
the<00:02:15.000> digit<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:15.870> instance<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.260> zero<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
the digit so for instance is zero and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.480 
the digit so for instance is zero and
this<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.020> zero<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.950> multiply<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
this is zero and you multiply that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.950 
this is zero and you multiply that
number<00:02:20.550> by<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.990> base<00:02:22.290> base<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.610> base<00:02:24.450> two<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
number by the base base to base two and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.330 
number by the base base to base two and
in<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> position<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.830> digit

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
in the position that digit

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.020 
in the position that digit
this<00:02:26.700> right<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.450> position<00:02:28.320> zero<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.940> you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this right here is position zero so you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200 
this right here is position zero so you
do<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.860> zeroth<00:02:32.250> power<00:02:32.280> which<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.120> gonna

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
do to the zeroth power which is gonna

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.070 
do to the zeroth power which is gonna
give<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> one<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.610> then<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.630> for<00:02:36.810> instance

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
give you one and then so for instance

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.150 
give you one and then so for instance
this<00:02:37.350> number<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:37.970> one<00:02:39.440> one<00:02:40.440> times

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
this number right here one one times

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.610 
this number right here one one times
base<00:02:41.550> 2<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> first<00:02:43.620> power<00:02:43.860> position<00:02:44.700> 1<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
base 2 to the first power position 1 and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.200 
base 2 to the first power position 1 and
here's<00:02:46.620> another<00:02:46.770> example<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.490> base<00:02:47.640> 10<00:02:47.940> and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
here's another example for base 10 and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:58.170 
here's another example for base 10 and
base<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:50.300> at<00:02:51.300> base<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:52.970> position<00:02:55.340> zero

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
base a at base a position zero

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.570 
base a at base a position zero
and<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.959> also<00:03:02.260> if<00:03:03.129> you<00:03:03.250> start<00:03:03.459> doing

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
and so and also if you start doing

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.160 
and so and also if you start doing
decimal<00:03:04.360> points<00:03:04.690> 0.1<00:03:05.549> it's<00:03:06.549> kind<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.450> reverse

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
decimal points 0.1 it's kind of reverse

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.470 
decimal points 0.1 it's kind of reverse
you<00:03:08.709> go<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.069> zero<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.610> one<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.420> you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
you go from zero to one here and you

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.740 
you go from zero to one here and you
just<00:03:10.629> go<00:03:10.720> from<00:03:10.870> zero<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.200> negative<00:03:11.379> one<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.750> if

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
just go from zero to negative one so if

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.009 
just go from zero to negative one so if
it's<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.019> point<00:03:14.379> zero<00:03:14.739> one<00:03:15.040> maybe<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
it's like point zero one maybe a to the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.839 
it's like point zero one maybe a to the
negative<00:03:17.319> two<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> start<00:03:18.549> taking<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
negative two so you start taking the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.940 
negative two so you start taking the
position<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.329> subtract<00:03:20.140> one<00:03:20.260> from<00:03:20.440> that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.789 

here's<00:03:23.950> someone<00:03:24.190> here's<00:03:24.670> another<00:03:24.849> example<00:03:25.120> of

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
here's someone here's another example of

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.350 
here's someone here's another example of
if<00:03:26.799> you<00:03:26.890> just<00:03:27.010> add<00:03:27.220> one<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.640> each<00:03:27.700> case<00:03:27.970> what<00:03:28.299> is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
if you just add one to each case what is

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.420 
if you just add one to each case what is
gonna<00:03:28.510> go<00:03:28.629> to<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.110> base<00:03:29.260> 2<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.560> go<00:03:29.680> zero<00:03:30.069> one

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
gonna go to so base 2 you go zero one

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.319 
gonna go to so base 2 you go zero one
ten<00:03:30.849> eleven<00:03:31.299> one<00:03:31.390> hundred<00:03:33.000> time<00:03:34.000> gives<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.269> an

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
ten eleven one hundred time gives you an

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.170 
ten eleven one hundred time gives you an
example<00:03:34.569> where<00:03:34.840> you'd<00:03:34.930> go<00:03:35.109> base<00:03:35.890> 16<00:03:36.489> Oh

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
example where you'd go base 16 Oh

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 
example where you'd go base 16 Oh
once<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> start<00:03:38.140> getting<00:03:38.349> to<00:03:38.410> nine<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:39.040> go<00:03:39.160> to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
once you start getting to nine you go to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.830 
once you start getting to nine you go to
a<00:03:39.549> b<00:03:40.239> c<00:03:40.599> d<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.620> f<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.730> worth<00:03:43.000> fifteen

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
a b c d and f which is worth fifteen

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.530 
a b c d and f which is worth fifteen
when<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.560> add<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.859> 15<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.640> get<00:03:45.849> you<00:03:46.359> move

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
when you add one to 15 you get you move

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.539 
when you add one to 15 you get you move
over<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.750> next<00:03:46.930> decimal<00:03:47.260> point<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:47.799> 10

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.920 

now<00:03:51.549> let's<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.909> want<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.090> convert<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.750> base

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
now let's you want to convert to base

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.160 
now let's you want to convert to base

the<00:03:56.260> value<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.950> each<00:03:57.190> digit<00:03:57.269> so<00:03:58.269> for<00:03:58.420> instance

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the value of each digit so for instance

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.319 
the value of each digit so for instance
the<00:03:59.500> base<00:03:59.940> two<00:04:01.019> times<00:04:02.019> its<00:04:02.500> position<00:04:02.889> zero<00:04:03.459> now

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
the base two times its position zero now

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.990 
the base two times its position zero now
your<00:04:05.109> this<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.579> value<00:04:06.880> of<00:04:06.940> that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
your this this is the the value of that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.629 
your this this is the the value of that
individual<00:04:07.359> place<00:04:07.569> so<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:07.959> could<00:04:08.079> always<00:04:08.200> do

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
individual place so you could always do

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.750 
individual place so you could always do
one<00:04:09.639> x<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.230> zero<00:04:11.500> power<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:12.340> right<00:04:12.549> here

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
one x to the zero power like right here

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.430 
one x to the zero power like right here
and<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.269> could<00:04:13.389> add<00:04:13.569> every<00:04:13.959> single<00:04:14.230> one<00:04:14.290> these

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
and you could add every single one these

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.529 
and you could add every single one these
up<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.919> can<00:04:15.040> do<00:04:15.099> this<00:04:15.250> or<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.359> do<00:04:16.419> an

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
up you can do this or you can do an

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.699 
up you can do this or you can do an
alternative<00:04:16.930> solution<00:04:17.109> which<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.470> called<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
alternative solution which is called the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.800 
alternative solution which is called the
Horner<00:04:18.160> rewrite<00:04:18.519> any<00:04:19.329> way<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.479> do<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
Horner rewrite any way you do is you

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.710 
Horner rewrite any way you do is you
just<00:04:19.840> write<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.139> number<00:04:20.260> here<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:21.310> 1<00:04:21.549> 0<00:04:21.970> 1<00:04:22.150> 0<00:04:22.210> 1

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
just write the number here so 1 0 1 0 1

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.550 
just write the number here so 1 0 1 0 1
0<00:04:22.780> 1<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:24.220> write<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.460> number<00:04:24.669> here<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:26.050> that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
0 1 you write the number here and that

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.650 
0 1 you write the number here and that
we<00:04:26.620> do<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.949> take<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.310> number<00:04:27.520> number<00:04:28.510> you

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
we do is you take this number number you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.460 
we do is you take this number number you
drop<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.139> down<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:29.820> skokie<00:04:30.820> okay<00:04:31.000> 1<00:04:31.270> 1<00:04:32.229> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
drop it down and skokie okay 1 1 and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.830 
drop it down and skokie okay 1 1 and
then<00:04:33.130> we<00:04:33.220> do<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.639> take<00:04:33.789> the<00:04:33.940> 1<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.419> you

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
then we do is you take the 1 and you

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.219 
then we do is you take the 1 and you
move<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.199> over<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.870> number

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
move it over here and you do that number

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.670 
move it over here and you do that number
1<00:04:38.919> times<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.760> base<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.210> 1<00:04:40.389> times<00:04:40.570> 2<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.110> then

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
1 times the base so 1 times 2 and then

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.680 
1 times the base so 1 times 2 and then
we<00:04:41.740> do<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.919> you<00:04:42.010> take<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.460> result<00:04:42.610> of<00:04:43.000> this

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we do is you take the result of this

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.290 
we do is you take the result of this
place<00:04:44.500> which<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:44.979> 2<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.639> add<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.820> little<00:04:46.180> of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
place which is 2 and you add a little of

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.589 
place which is 2 and you add a little of
it<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:46.690> 0<00:04:47.169> plus<00:04:47.410> 2<00:04:47.680> is<00:04:47.889> 2<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.580> they<00:04:49.360> keep<00:04:49.510> in

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
it so 0 plus 2 is 2 and they keep in

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:50.820 
it so 0 plus 2 is 2 and they keep in
repeating<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:49.930> process<00:04:50.139> or<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.560> take<00:04:50.650> this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
repeating this process or you take this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.089 
repeating this process or you take this
two<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:52.000> two<00:04:52.060> right<00:04:52.419> here<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.650> move<00:04:53.979> it

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
two this two right here and you move it

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.379 
two this two right here and you move it
over<00:04:54.280> here<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.639> you<00:04:54.820> multiply<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.240> by<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
over here and you multiply it by the

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.939 
over here and you multiply it by the
base<00:04:55.599> so<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.289> get<00:04:56.410> 2<00:04:56.620> times<00:04:57.130> 2<00:04:57.449> just<00:04:58.449> 4<00:04:58.949> plus

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
base so you get 2 times 2 just 4 plus

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.279 
base so you get 2 times 2 just 4 plus
the<00:05:00.250> 1<00:05:00.430> gives<00:05:00.789> you<00:05:00.910> 5<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.510> then<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.050> bring

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
the 1 gives you 5 and then you bring

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.520 
the 1 gives you 5 and then you bring
this<00:05:02.740> 5<00:05:03.010> over<00:05:03.970> here<00:05:04.270> times<00:05:04.570> 2<00:05:04.930> drop<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:05.470> down

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
this 5 over here times 2 drop it down

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.560 
this 5 over here times 2 drop it down
etc<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:06.099> so<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.849> pretty<00:05:07.000> much<00:05:07.060> keep<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.390> doing

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
etc and so you pretty much keep on doing

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.890 
etc and so you pretty much keep on doing
that<00:05:07.719> in<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.590> get<00:05:08.680> over<00:05:08.830> here

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
that in to get over here

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.560 
that in to get over here
and<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:11.570> 42<00:05:12.570> times<00:05:12.690> two<00:05:13.020> plus<00:05:13.199> one

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
and so you have 42 times two plus one

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.230 
and so you have 42 times two plus one
which<00:05:15.570> is<00:05:15.600> 84<00:05:16.229> plus<00:05:16.440> 185<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.490> here's<00:05:18.030> your

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
which is 84 plus 185 and here's your

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.930 
which is 84 plus 185 and here's your
result<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:19.669> ten<00:05:20.669> tenten<00:05:21.389> one<00:05:21.780> base<00:05:22.020> two<00:05:22.350> equals

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
result so ten tenten one base two equals

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.659 
result so ten tenten one base two equals
85<00:05:23.940> base<00:05:24.810> 10<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:25.410> yours<00:05:26.130> different<00:05:26.370> ways<00:05:26.580> to

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
85 base 10 and yours different ways to

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:27.219 
85 base 10 and yours different ways to
do<00:05:26.759> it

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
do it

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.230 
do it
let's<00:05:28.229> want<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.440> convert<00:05:28.650> from<00:05:28.860> base<00:05:29.370> 10<00:05:29.699> we

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
let's want to convert from base 10 we

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.960 
let's want to convert from base 10 we
use<00:05:30.389> take<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.660> number<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.500> 13<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.310> 7<00:05:32.789> base

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
use take the number it's a 13 to 7 base

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.999 
use take the number it's a 13 to 7 base
10<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.449> you<00:05:34.440> write<00:05:34.620> here

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
10 and you write here

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.909 
10 and you write here
it's<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.250> 13<00:05:35.639> 207<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.389> they<00:05:36.840> need<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.560> divide

it's a 13 207 and they need you divide

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.469 
it's a 13 207 and they need you divide
it<00:05:38.100> by<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.759> base<00:05:38.910> you're<00:05:39.090> trying<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.300> go<00:05:39.360> back

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
it by the base you're trying to go back

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.129 
it by the base you're trying to go back
to<00:05:39.539> your<00:05:39.660> page<00:05:40.639> 1616<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:41.910> this<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:42.960> gonna<00:05:43.050> help

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
you to organize this in a table so just

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.800 
you to organize this in a table so just
keep<00:05:46.260> people<00:05:46.560> like<00:05:46.680> me<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.039> 13<00:05:47.789> 2<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:48.030> 700<00:05:48.300> X<00:05:48.479> 16

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
keep people like me so 13 2 is 700 X 16

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.140 
keep people like me so 13 2 is 700 X 16
equals<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.410> you<00:05:49.949> want<00:05:50.100> to<00:05:50.220> record<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.760> result

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
equals and you want to record the result

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.400 
equals and you want to record the result
and<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.900> remainder

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
and the remainder

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.900 
and the remainder
it's<00:05:52.620> gonna<00:05:52.710> be<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:52.979> important<00:05:53.520> so<00:05:53.880> keep

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
it's gonna be very important so keep

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.000 
it's gonna be very important so keep
this<00:05:54.210> organized<00:05:54.570> now<00:05:55.289> let's<00:05:55.500> say<00:05:55.650> you<00:05:55.710> divide

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
this organized now let's say you divide

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.350 
this organized now let's say you divide
the<00:05:56.220> two<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.610> get<00:05:56.789> eight<00:05:58.130> 25.4<00:05:59.130> 375<00:06:00.000> now

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
the two and you get eight 25.4 375 now

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.800 
the two and you get eight 25.4 375 now
we<00:06:00.870> do<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.199> you<00:06:01.320> just<00:06:01.380> do<00:06:01.710> 8<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.340> 5<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:03.539> keep<00:06:03.720> the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
we do is you just do 8 to 5 you keep the

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.810 
we do is you just do 8 to 5 you keep the
whole<00:06:03.930> number<00:06:04.169> 85<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.979> then<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.580> take<00:06:05.699> the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
whole number 85 and then you take the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.820 
whole number 85 and then you take the
decimal<00:06:06.000> point<00:06:06.360> which<00:06:06.510> is<00:06:07.610> 0.4<00:06:09.020> 375<00:06:10.020> a<00:06:10.380> nice

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
decimal point which is 0.4 375 a nice

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
down to this digit right here and you

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.790 
down to this digit right here and you
repeat<00:06:34.260> the<00:06:34.349> process

825 divide 16 equals 51 right under 9

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.610 
825 divide 16 equals 51 right under 9
and<00:06:37.800> then<00:06:38.789> you<00:06:38.880> take<00:06:39.060> 51<00:06:39.630> you<00:06:40.260> put<00:06:40.470> it<00:06:40.530> over

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
and then you take 51 you put it over

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.000 
and then you take 51 you put it over
here<00:06:40.889> 51<00:06:41.880> 5<00:06:42.030> 16<00:06:42.539> et<00:06:42.780> cetera<00:06:42.960> and<00:06:43.560> you<00:06:43.620> keep<00:06:43.860> on

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
here 51 5 16 et cetera and you keep on

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.200 
here 51 5 16 et cetera and you keep on
doing<00:06:44.280> this<00:06:44.430> until<00:06:45.830> in<00:06:46.830> this<00:06:46.979> case<00:06:47.220> you<00:06:47.669> get<00:06:47.820> 3

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
doing this until in this case you get 3

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.640 
doing this until in this case you get 3
remainder<00:06:48.690> 3<00:06:48.990> you<00:06:49.500> drop<00:06:49.710> down<00:06:49.860> 3<00:06:50.720> 3<00:06:51.720> is<00:06:51.930> less

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
remainder 3 you drop down 3 3 is less

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.879 
remainder 3 you drop down 3 3 is less
than<00:06:52.949> 16<00:06:53.550> so<00:06:54.449> when<00:06:54.570> you<00:06:54.659> divide<00:06:55.020> 3<00:06:55.320> by<00:06:55.349> 16

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
than 16 so when you divide 3 by 16

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.710 
than 16 so when you divide 3 by 16
you're<00:06:56.010> gonna<00:06:56.099> get<00:06:56.220> 0<00:06:56.669> for<00:06:57.000> the<00:06:57.419> remainder<00:06:57.599> of

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
you're gonna get 0 for the remainder of

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.110 
you're gonna get 0 for the remainder of
3<00:06:58.199> when<00:06:59.099> you<00:06:59.220> notice<00:06:59.490> that<00:06:59.610> the<00:06:59.729> 3<00:06:59.970> is<00:07:00.030> less

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
3 when you notice that the 3 is less

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.170 
3 when you notice that the 3 is less
than<00:07:00.180> 16<00:07:00.750> you<00:07:01.349> know<00:07:01.380> that<00:07:01.590> you're<00:07:01.680> done<00:07:01.949> and<00:07:02.190> we
