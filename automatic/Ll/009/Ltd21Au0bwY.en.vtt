00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and we are completely are quite proud of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.080 
and we are completely are quite proud of
that<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.950> last<00:00:49.950> season<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.670> didn't<00:00:50.879> write

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that because last season we didn't write

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
that because last season we didn't write
anything<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.020> improvised<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.399> was

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
anything we just improvised and that was

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.790 
anything we just improvised and that was
basically<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> way<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.300> did<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
basically the way how we did it and that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.979 
basically the way how we did it and that
was<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.949> really<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> best<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> good

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
was just really not the best way of good

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
was just really not the best way of good
like<00:00:58.289> doing<00:00:58.590> things<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.640> not

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
like doing things because it was not

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.110 
like doing things because it was not
professional<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:03.000> actually

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
professional at all and now we actually

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
professional at all and now we actually
write<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> complete<00:01:03.930> story<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.309> season

screenshots and backgrounds and that's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
screenshots and backgrounds and that's
basically<00:01:38.189> showing<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.759> already<00:01:39.119> where<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
basically showing you already where this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.920 
basically showing you already where this
is<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> tropical<00:01:41.280> island<00:01:41.930> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is going to be on a tropical island so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.139 
is going to be on a tropical island so
we<00:01:43.049> did<00:01:43.200> indeed<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> boats<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.610> mean<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
we did indeed get off the boats I mean I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
we did indeed get off the boats I mean I
will<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.540> quite<00:01:46.079> logical<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.770> didn't<00:01:46.979> get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
will be quite logical if we didn't get

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
will be quite logical if we didn't get
off<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.700> will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.119> end<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
off them that will be the end of the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.560 
off them that will be the end of the
catalyst<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.060> boats<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
catalyst but we do get off the boats and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.929 
catalyst but we do get off the boats and
in<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.770> find<00:01:53.070> something<00:01:53.340> completely

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
in we find something completely

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.880

different are these the characters find
something<00:01:56.189> completely<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.329> they

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
something completely different that they

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.679 
something completely different that they
actually<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.369> find<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.820> hoped

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
actually thought they will find or hoped

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
actually thought they will find or hoped
since<00:02:01.619> they<00:02:01.890> were<00:02:01.950> hoping<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> find

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
since they were hoping to find

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.179 
since they were hoping to find
civilization<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.659> instead<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.189> distrans

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
civilization but instead they distrans

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.730 
civilization but instead they distrans
on<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> tropical<00:02:06.479> island<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.619> have

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
on a tropical island and they don't have

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770 
on a tropical island and they don't have
a<00:02:07.860> choice<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.209> actually<00:02:09.599> just

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a choice they they can actually just

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.260 
a choice they they can actually just
continue<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.700> trip<00:02:11.970> because

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
continue with with the trip because

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.200 
continue with with the trip because
they're<00:02:12.450> running<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> reach

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
they're running out of reach

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.720 
they're running out of reach
horses<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.620> some<00:02:14.620> other<00:02:14.830> things<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.610> I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
horses and some other things that I I

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.970 
horses and some other things that I I
will<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.480> say<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.790> they<00:02:19.240> are<00:02:19.450> basically

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
will not say so they are basically

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.000 
will not say so they are basically
pushed<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.490> island<00:02:21.850> basically<00:02:22.420> stranded

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
pushed on the island basically stranded

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.680 
pushed on the island basically stranded
so<00:02:24.010> they<00:02:24.460> will<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> survive<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.570> that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so they will have to survive on that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.660 
so they will have to survive on that
island<00:02:26.080> for<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.650> bit<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> that's

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
island for a little bit and that's

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
island for a little bit and that's
basically<00:02:27.910> how<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.390> first<00:02:28.750> part<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
basically how the first part of the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.920 
basically how the first part of the
season<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:31.330> we're

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
to really make this video that long is

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.270 
to really make this video that long is
talking<00:04:07.870> about<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.200> length<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.860> episodes

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
talking about the length of the episodes

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.760 
talking about the length of the episodes
and<00:04:09.490> length<00:04:09.730> of<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:09.970> season<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:11.290> can't

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
and length of the season so I can't

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.830 
and length of the season so I can't
really<00:04:12.250> say<00:04:12.640> how<00:04:12.880> long<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.120> season<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.660> going

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
really say how long the season is going

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.050 
really say how long the season is going
to<00:04:13.960> be<00:04:14.110> what<00:04:14.830> we<00:04:14.980> think<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.460> be<00:04:15.700> it's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
to be what we think it will be it's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.930 
to be what we think it will be it's
about<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.650> same<00:04:17.859> amount<00:04:17.920> of<00:04:18.310> episodes<00:04:18.760> as

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
about the same amount of episodes as

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.560 
about the same amount of episodes as
last<00:04:19.180> time<00:04:19.420> maybe<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.200> little<00:04:20.410> bit<00:04:20.620> more<00:04:20.830> but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
last time maybe a little bit more but

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.480 
last time maybe a little bit more but
the<00:04:22.570> episodes<00:04:23.050> will<00:04:23.290> be<00:04:23.410> way<00:04:23.680> longer<00:04:24.040> since

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
the episodes will be way longer since

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.330 
the episodes will be way longer since
every<00:04:24.910> episode<00:04:25.270> will<00:04:25.450> from<00:04:25.630> now<00:04:25.660> on<00:04:25.780> be

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
every episode will from now on be

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.990 
every episode will from now on be
a<00:04:26.580> consistent<00:04:27.389> 25<00:04:28.020> minutes<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.850> there<00:04:29.850> will

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
a consistent 25 minutes and there will

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.450 
a consistent 25 minutes and there will
be<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.600> lot<00:04:31.110> more<00:04:31.139> work<00:04:31.560> put<00:04:31.860> into<00:04:32.010> them<00:04:32.310> and

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
be a lot more work put into them and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.550 
be a lot more work put into them and
that's<00:04:32.790> why<00:04:33.030> we<00:04:33.510> can<00:04:33.720> only<00:04:33.810> really<00:04:34.169> do<00:04:34.320> one

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
that's why we can only really do one

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.129 
that's why we can only really do one
episode<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.010> week<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.940> instead<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.300> two

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
episode a week so instead of two

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.420 
episode a week so instead of two
episodes<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.620> week<00:04:37.650> we're<00:04:37.979> going<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.160> do<00:04:38.250> one

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
episodes a week we're going to do one

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.210 
episodes a week we're going to do one
but<00:04:39.060> they<00:04:39.180> will<00:04:39.389> all<00:04:39.510> be<00:04:39.690> 25<00:04:40.139> minutes<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.710> it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
but they will all be 25 minutes and it

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.129 
but they will all be 25 minutes and it
will<00:04:41.370> all<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.820> lot<00:04:42.150> lot<00:04:42.540> better<00:04:42.810> because

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
will all be a lot lot better because

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.080 
will all be a lot lot better because
we're<00:04:43.470> going<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.650> put<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:44.729> ton<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:44.910> work

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
we're going to put a ton of work

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.700 
we're going to put a ton of work
into<00:04:45.330> them<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.780> we've<00:04:45.930> actually<00:04:46.169> plant<00:04:46.560> them

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
into them and we've actually plant them

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.980 
into them and we've actually plant them
out<00:04:46.830> really<00:04:47.010> well<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.540> should<00:04:48.840> be<00:04:48.960> all

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
