00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.200
 the play of the game meant the 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.950
 third goal of melgar but the figure was 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.950
 larry yáñez 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.250
 the domain thrashed science and keeps 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.350
 the undefeated local at 8 minutes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
 yáñez overflows left and enable 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.080
 julián di cosmo who achieves his eighth goal 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.080
 at the tournament 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.640
 a little step for here and another for there with 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.280
 good rhythm melgar achieved the second 16 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 larry minutes of powerful shot he jammed 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 the second 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.300
 I gave cosmo and reverse and in the arch of 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.879
 unsafe oscar castro minutes after 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.280
 cristian garcía would see the red card 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.010
 for an aggression against the attacker 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.710
 red and black and again the rich in 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 score of seven is well-deserved 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 but if it was not also the table goal 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.550
 blocks from the tactical point of view and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 individual 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.210
 the bull shouted it with all his soul were 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.210
 the 22 of the complement 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.760
 before this the arch would have 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760
 closed 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 if I turn on showed very little by name 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 it's a good team but maybe with the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 inadequate technical the interest went through 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.259
 see the ex melgarianos pereira gárate 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.259
 and rivero 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.369
 Melgar won because he scored the goals in 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.100
 the exact moments fourth in the tournament 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.930
 put higher in glass both 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.930
