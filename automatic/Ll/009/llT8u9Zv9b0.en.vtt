 video I will be for 1 and a half minutes 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.730

 a lot of questions that often 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 are set and so I made a separate 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.649
 daddy that 's where you'll see 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.270
 all the questions that are very often asked and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 there may be this question of you too 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 interested in going at it you can 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.640
 look and find out what it is and in 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.520
 Further if you did not find 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.519
 information information for you was 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.990
 incomplete question you did not reveal you 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.090
 can go subscribing to my channel 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 watch and choose the video in which you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 and exhaustive 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.430
 so the question is the question is it possible 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.450
 polish glass lights 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 played lights can be polished and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.280
 the windshield is the same but it is very 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.400
 sophisticated technology that just you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.130
 for garage is unacceptable and expensive 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.229
 the operation will be cheaper to simply change 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.960
 glass or even lights 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 that is, such a polishing technology 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490
 glasses i don't know are acceptable maybe 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.579

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.009

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.850
 how do you know glass twins and one 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.700
 glass costs about 700 dollars so 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.130
 what better to just change the glass 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.710
 but if you have plastic on the headlights 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.009
 the glasses are polished they are easy to ipad 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.979
 varnish unfold can look at 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.140
