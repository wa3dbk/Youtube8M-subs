00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.630
 I do not like to talk about losses 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.210
 when he interviewed someone who is a 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.030
 super important trajectory in the 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.009
 football history anyway 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.730
 I think people want to know what 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.960
 he went from world 74 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.200
 in the distance because it was not so bad 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 because that failure 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.380
 difficult but more assorted 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.690
 nowadays he thinks that the error was 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.360
 example towards think that there was a little 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 let's say to which the school wants 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 who traveled to germany since we came 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.470
 many repatriated and logically that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.000
 when from different countries 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.130
 I do not know work with the team that more or 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 except the technician thought it was the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:03.150
 ideal for to play then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.150
 logically if he played more by name 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 for football or political moments 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.060
 burning of the game system 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.170
 system 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.750
 the first time 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.110
 It was a good company 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.630
 74 after World 74 I went to play 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.270
 granada and 76 powder asked 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.120
 again that our and the other to 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 growing too 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.310
 and in 78 again and for copperloa 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.380
 America will run house of cali 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.380
 who lived 81 years old doctor 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.060
 it is true that archers have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:34.440
 better since for example they are still 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.440
 subscribed to a field football player 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.000
 Hold on 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360
 29 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.330
 his best moment would place him better 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:14.599
 in 1968 the rest of the group that 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.580
 They invited him to play in Brazil with rest 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.349
 of the world the record to me even though he had the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.349
 record to me is not to say 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.020
 9 I was the best archer there is two years 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.520
 but 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.070
 in low moments 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.050
 then I was never thought that his 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.910
 sports career that could touch him 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.290
 which national can never accept very 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.290
 difficult because of little 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.320
 an important respecting the adversary 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.230
 having friends of national player 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.310
 but 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.310
 inside the field 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.270
 in the aromos working percent 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 very happy part I know many 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.610
 players and also luckily 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.260
 never the players 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:56.540
 logically because it's about - there's the 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:59.020
 kickback or if it was not your thing and most 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.770
 what to think 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.770
 pretty 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.349
 seriously 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:15.410
 to classmates and I could see here 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.760
 but the way to act even though 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:25.790
 has a 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:28.720
 with the barbaric propaganda to fly that 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.700
 santoro we 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.050
 is the stalker a Uruguayan archer of the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.050
 present whom I would name 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.420
 a foreign archer 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.110
 wants 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.110
 Some 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.500
 the one from argentina 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.500
 the truth that I touched the car 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.119
 yes 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.739

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:09.229
 calyx product that luxury that we can not 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:11.659
 give that who live in this 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.879
 Montevideo of this country so loaded with 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.250
 value since it allows one in a 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:19.470
 sports program 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.020
 thank you in the luxury of interviewing and 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.370
 chatting and going through life is impossible 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.530
 go over his whole career because 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:32.509
 we should have 345 programs but 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:32.509
 Many years passed and many people 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.330

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.340

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.340
 enjoy like so many others 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.660
 players who learn 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:06.200
 like other former players who are 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:08.750
