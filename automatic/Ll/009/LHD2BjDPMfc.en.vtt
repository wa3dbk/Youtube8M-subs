00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
this is a uniform machine what we have

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
this is a uniform machine what we have
here<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:07.340> we<00:00:08.340> have<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.519> shirt<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.269> our<00:00:09.360> wet<00:00:09.570> box

here is we have a shirt in our wet box

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
here is we have a shirt in our wet box
and<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.620> pressed<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> shirts<00:00:11.370> monitor<00:00:11.790> wet

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and we pressed the shirts monitor wet

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.850 
and we pressed the shirts monitor wet
because<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.330> gives<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> lot<00:00:13.019> better<00:00:13.290> feeling

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
because it gives it a lot better feeling

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.230 
because it gives it a lot better feeling
so<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:15.420> she's<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:17.460> she's

here is messing the cuffs and collars so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
here is messing the cuffs and collars so
what<00:00:26.310> we're<00:00:26.430> doing<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> we're

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
what we're doing here is we're

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.370 
what we're doing here is we're
compressing<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.980> cup<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> collars<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:31.080> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
compressing the cup and collars and this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.540 
compressing the cup and collars and this
is<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.740> nice<00:00:31.859> machine<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
is a really nice machine because it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
is a really nice machine because it
presses<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> cup<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.570> also<00:00:33.870> beats<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> at

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
presses the cup and it also beats it at

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.959 
presses the cup and it also beats it at
the<00:00:34.500> same<00:00:34.710> time

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.229 

now<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.750> machine<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.699> all<00:00:44.969> metal

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
now this machine here this is all metal

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.950 
now this machine here this is all metal
it's<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.199> regular<00:00:46.590> iron<00:00:47.449> so<00:00:48.449> what<00:00:48.809> you're

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it's like a regular iron so what you're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
it's like a regular iron so what you're
doing<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:50.039> heat<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
doing is you're using the heat from the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:04.780 
doing is you're using the heat from the
machine<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> dry<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.690> shirt<00:00:51.989> while<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> wet

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.370 

so<00:01:05.270> what<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:05.540> doing<00:01:05.750> right<00:01:05.780> now<00:01:05.900> is<00:01:06.230> is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so what it's doing right now is is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.270 
so what it's doing right now is is
pushing<00:01:06.800> up<00:01:06.920> against<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.180> hot<00:01:08.390> metal<00:01:08.660> here

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
pushing up against the hot metal here

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.000 
pushing up against the hot metal here
and<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:10.550> have<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.760> pad<00:01:11.120> underneath<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.050> cuff

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
and we have a pad underneath the cuff

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.560 
and we have a pad underneath the cuff
and<00:01:13.160> collars<00:01:13.610> which<00:01:13.880> kind<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.150> gives<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.420> some

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and collars which kind of gives it some

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.240 
and collars which kind of gives it some
leeway<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.020> we<00:01:15.230> don't<00:01:15.410> break<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.710> buttons<00:01:16.070> off

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
leeway so we don't break the buttons off

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.520 
leeway so we don't break the buttons off
the<00:01:16.400> stuff

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.750 

so<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.090> later<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.800> you<00:01:22.800> go<00:01:22.950> through<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.370> other

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
so and later on you go through the other

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.310 
so and later on you go through the other
process<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.630> show<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
process will show you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.250 
process will show you
but<00:01:25.790> sometimes<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.600> machine<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.140> break

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
but sometimes this machine will break

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.149 
but sometimes this machine will break
the<00:01:28.409> top<00:01:28.650> button<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.590> replace<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the top button off so we replace that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.840 
the top button off so we replace that
the<00:01:32.310> green

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 

so<00:01:39.300> now<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.690> we<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> finished<00:01:40.530> cup

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
so now what we have is a finished cup

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
so now what we have is a finished cup
and<00:01:40.920> collar<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.120> real<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:44.690> as<00:01:45.690> what

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and collar these are real nice as what

machine<00:02:00.540> uses<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> vacuum<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.770> hold<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> shirt

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
machine uses a vacuum to hold the shirt

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.780 
machine uses a vacuum to hold the shirt
to<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.800> some<00:02:04.800> machines<00:02:05.160> have<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.400> little<00:02:05.640> metal

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to it some machines have a little metal

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
to it some machines have a little metal
bar<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.300> here<00:02:06.479> that'll<00:02:06.690> leave<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.900> mark

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
bar right here that'll leave a mark

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.580 
bar right here that'll leave a mark
which<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.100> just<00:02:08.429> extra<00:02:08.990> working<00:02:09.990> in<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
which is just extra working in the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.090 
which is just extra working in the
future<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.959> what<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.140> does<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.590> extends<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
future so what it does is it extends the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.479 
future so what it does is it extends the
sleeves<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.560> you've<00:02:16.709> still<00:02:17.070> got<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> really

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
sleeves so you've still got a really

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.150 
sleeves so you've still got a really
nice<00:02:17.700> cup<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> collar<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:20.070> way

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that's gonna happen is the shirt

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.180 
that's gonna happen is the shirt
machine's<00:02:21.780> gonna<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.110> inside<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
machine's gonna go inside here and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.370 
machine's gonna go inside here and
there's<00:02:23.910> two<00:02:24.000> hot<00:02:24.570> metal<00:02:24.900> plates<00:02:25.200> with
