00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
actually better although the gun got the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.969 
actually better although the gun got the
lower<00:01:03.320> penetration<00:01:04.320> rate<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.339> tank<00:01:05.580> itself

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
lower penetration rate the tank itself

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
lower penetration rate the tank itself
can<00:01:07.979> withstand<00:01:08.220> almost<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:09.030> much<00:01:09.330> damage<00:01:09.600> as

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

well just know that collision range in
this<00:01:49.090> game<00:01:49.680> besides<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.610> tide<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.000> battle<00:01:55.320> so

the second rebound and that map and that

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.199 
the second rebound and that map and that
spot<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:07.060> here<00:02:07.479> from<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:08.950> shoot<00:02:09.369> those

those ball things which are going to the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.699 
those ball things which are going to the
center<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.239> spotted<00:02:19.239> them<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.959> allowed<00:02:20.380> our

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
center I spotted them I allowed our

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.449 
center I spotted them I allowed our
artillery<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.670> shoot<00:02:21.910> them<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:23.310> will<00:02:24.310> be

and I think it's time although I stick

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.400 
and I think it's time although I stick
my<00:03:18.100> rear<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:20.410> flew<00:03:21.210> from<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
my rear that flew from the right and I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.730 
my rear that flew from the right and I
get<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:26.550> finish<00:03:27.550> that<00:03:28.000> off<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:29.560> one

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
get to finish that off that one

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.960 
get to finish that off that one
by<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.430> way<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.880> bounce<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.460> this<00:03:34.460> shell<00:03:34.700> from

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
by the way I bounce of this shell from

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.340 
by the way I bounce of this shell from
behind<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:37.660> sticking<00:03:38.660> my<00:03:38.690> angel<00:03:39.200> became

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
behind I'm sticking my angel became

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.040 
behind I'm sticking my angel became
so<00:03:41.340> he<00:03:41.580> won't<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.850> able<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.240> penetrate<00:03:42.390> me<00:03:42.870> that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
so he won't be able to penetrate me that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.550 
so he won't be able to penetrate me that
easily<00:03:44.090> he<00:03:45.090> doesn't<00:03:45.660> want<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.930> shoot<00:03:46.140> me<00:03:46.350> too

easily he doesn't want to shoot me too

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.490 
easily he doesn't want to shoot me too
by<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.740> way<00:03:46.860> he<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.850> not<00:03:48.090> able<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.290> aim

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.240 
by the way he is not able to aim
correctly<00:03:50.660> he<00:03:51.660> shot<00:03:51.900> my<00:03:52.080> gun<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:53.040> that

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
correctly he shot my gun but that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.060 
correctly he shot my gun but that
doesn't<00:03:53.640> matter<00:03:54.320> he<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.740> take<00:03:55.920> it

he's going to take it now no chances no

my<00:04:03.540> gun<00:04:03.720> pool<00:04:03.930> he<00:04:04.350> penetrated<00:04:04.950> my<00:04:06.410> lowest

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
my gun pool he penetrated my lowest

my gun pool he penetrated my lowest
armor<00:04:07.860> plate<00:04:08.960> doesn't<00:04:09.960> matter<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.940> think<00:04:11.940> our

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
armor plate doesn't matter I think our

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.000 
armor plate doesn't matter I think our
base<00:04:12.980> is<00:04:13.980> being<00:04:14.340> captured<00:04:14.550> right<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:16.010> our

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
base is being captured right now our

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.110 
base is being captured right now our
team<00:04:17.660> died<00:04:18.660> somewhere<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:20.580> battle<00:04:20.940> is

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
team died somewhere and the battle is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.200 
team died somewhere and the battle is
lost<00:04:21.950> anyway<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:24.110> cannot<00:04:25.110> hope<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:26.310> can't

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
lost anyway I cannot hope to I can't

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.860 
lost anyway I cannot hope to I can't
hope<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.540> run<00:04:27.990> through<00:04:28.890> our<00:04:28.950> base<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.870> break

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
hope to run through our base and break

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.440 
hope to run through our base and break
that<00:04:31.080> capturing<00:04:32.030> anyway<00:04:34.190> although<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.730> the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
that capturing anyway although it is the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.840 
that capturing anyway although it is the
loose<00:04:36.630> again<00:04:36.810> i<00:04:37.290> think<00:04:37.770> i<00:04:38.040> am<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.520> pass

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
loose again i think i am going to pass

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.900 
loose again i think i am going to pass
through<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.450> video<00:04:39.810> again<00:04:39.990> because<00:04:40.610> well<00:04:41.610> i

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
through that video again because well i

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.090 
through that video again because well i
was<00:04:42.480> able<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.960> take<00:04:44.150> 28<00:04:45.150> tanks<00:04:46.080> almost<00:04:46.350> alone

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
was able to take 28 tanks almost alone

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.380 
was able to take 28 tanks almost alone
almost<00:04:47.430> without<00:04:48.030> support<00:04:48.630> as<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.800> see<00:04:50.390> so

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
almost without support as you can see so

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.890 
almost without support as you can see so
i<00:04:51.830> think<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:53.130> shows<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:54.800> e75<00:04:55.800> isn't<00:04:56.460> so

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
i think it shows that the e75 isn't so

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.460 
i think it shows that the e75 isn't so
paperweight<00:04:57.900> at<00:04:58.080> all<00:04:58.610> anyway<00:04:59.930> let's<00:05:00.930> move<00:05:01.140> on

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
paperweight at all anyway let's move on

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.650 
paperweight at all anyway let's move on
to<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.800> next<00:05:01.830> video<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.880> means<00:05:03.500> see<00:05:04.500> you
