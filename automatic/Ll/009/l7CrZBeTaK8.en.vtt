00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:05.049
 so children in today's broadcast is clearly we ourselves 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.450
 a magnetic field as a professional was almost unhurt whose parents unexpected 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.789
 strong numbers can 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.789
 So seven aces would be the same 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.319
 As a guest to us, we create a significant cost or item 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.310
 until the move to or in the Metro Dollar 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.800
 Wilson will be magnet coating in black 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.039
 ever will 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.199
 Businessman day 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.289
 on every other side is for example on the head and on the stomach can recipe 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.120
 printed 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.550
 I have chosen here once with a craft manual, for example, we give 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.400
 not a sheet of paper a bit crass from Lingen 's native garden a cigarette for 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.110
 the tobacco and a carton for the filter 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.530
 and so on 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.770
 Since we no longer call this crafting instructions, they get us 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.120
 a cappy 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 and many 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.290
 Next, we need a graffiti sprayer best for that 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.340
 make us 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.320
 and of course there may be the big ones and stands for Bersani's lips 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 and we quickly became one too 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 Mars on Wacker Vasco 25 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.480
 the West is now skipping it with publicity for you 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 until 12 minutes 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.189
 primed so finished 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.710
 now we have to wait for Alba one hour for the paint to dry 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.270
 and then the rough can pen 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.330
 to work rank 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.630
 below 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 HH 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 none is 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 Ha 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 haha 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.769
 the manager stops 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.689
 generally weird d'un 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.830
 As far as finished with our first cards revealed 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.069
 on Wednesday 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.089
 but of course the article has made a cost of its own 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.709
 So now you want to see where we put our Flittard magnets everywhere 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.849
 can claim 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.270
 we have 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.270
 with Martin Baldauf Warsaw where she still lives 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 Become weapons 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.099
 the ATM manufacturer the vending machine 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.649
 beech wood 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.130
 To ensure clarity 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.879
 was three times 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.840
 or how can you tell yourself how to say next to the tracks of one? 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.909
 Friend November here you can take it further waiting Olaf Rammelt 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
 Bangkok easy in the next forest once more 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.279
 So that's it for today 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.379
 in the next 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.509
 and somehow typical are the rooms are the 1 the Tandberg 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:25.619
