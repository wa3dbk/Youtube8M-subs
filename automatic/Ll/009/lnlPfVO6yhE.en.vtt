this<00:00:19.150> one<00:00:20.849> at<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:21.939> time<00:00:22.089> I<00:00:22.359> really<00:00:22.599> really

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
this one at the time I really really

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.239 
this one at the time I really really
loved<00:00:22.990> it<00:00:23.140> because<00:00:23.230> it's<00:00:23.560> my<00:00:23.710> first<00:00:23.829> home<00:00:24.070> in<00:00:24.220> a

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:24.249 
loved it because it's my first home in a

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.439 
loved it because it's my first home in a
to<00:00:24.369> perform<00:00:24.669> really<00:00:24.820> well<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.179> got<00:00:25.300> great

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
to perform really well it got great

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.909 
to perform really well it got great
range<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.279> it<00:00:27.400> actually<00:00:27.699> worked<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:29.019> besides

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
range and it actually worked but besides

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.040 
range and it actually worked but besides
that<00:00:30.009> obviously<00:00:30.489> looking<00:00:30.730> at<00:00:30.909> now<00:00:31.119> it's<00:00:31.749> not

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
that obviously looking at now it's not

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.630 
that obviously looking at now it's not
exactly<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.529> cleanest<00:00:32.890> looking<00:00:33.100> thing<00:00:33.250> ever

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
exactly the cleanest looking thing ever

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.180 
exactly the cleanest looking thing ever
nor<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.420> sketch<00:00:34.809> ridiculously<00:00:35.559> reliable

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
nor is it sketch ridiculously reliable

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.760 
nor is it sketch ridiculously reliable
at<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.059> time<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.539> was<00:00:37.660> alright<00:00:38.020> it<00:00:38.260> caught

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
at the time it was alright it caught

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.880 
at the time it was alright it caught
pretty<00:00:39.190> much<00:00:39.570> most<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.690> time<00:00:40.899> but<00:00:41.170> now<00:00:41.859> that

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
pretty much most the time but now that

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.549 
pretty much most the time but now that
this<00:00:42.280> points<00:00:42.550> got<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.699> bit<00:00:42.879> worn<00:00:43.090> out<00:00:43.269> and<00:00:43.600> it

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
this points got a bit worn out and it

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.650 
this points got a bit worn out and it
still<00:00:44.949> works<00:00:45.129> sometimes<00:00:45.430> but<00:00:46.149> when<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.449> try

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
still works sometimes but when you try

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.470 
still works sometimes but when you try
this<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:48.280> kind<00:00:48.519> of<00:00:48.550> feels<00:00:48.760> like<00:00:48.879> it's<00:00:48.969> about<00:00:49.179> to

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
this it kind of feels like it's about to

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.569 
this it kind of feels like it's about to
define<00:00:50.289> itself<00:00:50.530> at<00:00:50.679> any<00:00:50.800> moment<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.309> if<00:00:51.489> you

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
define itself at any moment and if you

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.950 
define itself at any moment and if you
shake<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:51.850> it<00:00:52.000> probably<00:00:52.570> will

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
shake it it probably will

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.209 
shake it it probably will
so<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:55.210> not<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.629> most<00:00:55.769> it's<00:00:56.769> not<00:00:56.949> something

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
so it's not the most it's not something

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.740 
so it's not the most it's not something
I've<00:00:57.370> been<00:00:57.579> really<00:00:57.760> wild<00:00:58.030> anymore<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.570> terms

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
I've been really wild anymore in terms

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.150 
I've been really wild anymore in terms
of<00:00:58.839> any<00:00:58.960> sort<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.199> warning<00:00:59.379> anymore<00:00:59.769> so<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.039> was

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
of any sort of warning anymore so I was

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.750 
of any sort of warning anymore so I was
trying<00:01:00.429> to<00:01:01.410> create<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.559> new<00:01:02.710> homemade<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.429> has

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
trying to create a new homemade that has

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.460 
trying to create a new homemade that has
a<00:01:03.789> similar<00:01:04.089> pullback<00:01:04.720> design<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.199> I<00:01:05.260> really

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
a similar pullback design that I really

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.749 
a similar pullback design that I really
like<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.860> because<00:01:05.950> I<00:01:06.100> find<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.430> much<00:01:06.610> in

real<00:01:06.880> fun<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:08.890> wanted<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.340> incorporate<00:01:09.579> the

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
real fun but I wanted to incorporate the

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.899 
real fun but I wanted to incorporate the

using polycarbonate supposed to
clothespin<00:01:26.530> I<00:01:26.950> went<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.549> detailed<00:01:28.270> more<00:01:28.479> on

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
clothespin I went on detailed more on

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.020 
clothespin I went on detailed more on
this<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.750> my<00:01:28.869> last<00:01:29.079> video<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.619> or<00:01:30.399> two<00:01:30.729> videos

this in my last video on or two videos

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.749 
this in my last video on or two videos
ago<00:01:31.680> explaining<00:01:32.680> this<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.159> depth<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.579> can

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
ago explaining this in depth so you can

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.190 
ago explaining this in depth so you can
check<00:01:33.939> out<00:01:34.060> if<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.240> want<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.810> I've<00:01:35.049> got

check out if you want to and I've got

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.510 
check out if you want to and I've got
the<00:01:35.320> video<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.740> original<00:01:36.040> maybe<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.399> want

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
the video of the original maybe you want

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.539 
the video of the original maybe you want
to<00:01:36.549> see<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:38.100> trying<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.159> combine<00:01:39.280> those

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
to see that so trying to combine those

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.389 
to see that so trying to combine those
two<00:01:39.729> ideas<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:40.509> came<00:01:41.079> up<00:01:41.259> with<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.159> this<00:01:45.340> is

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
two ideas I came up with this so this is

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.520 
two ideas I came up with this so this is
my<00:01:45.549> latest<00:01:45.820> design<00:01:46.180> of<00:01:46.450> homemade<00:01:46.780> it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
my latest design of homemade it's

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.560 
my latest design of homemade it's
basically<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.070> snap<00:01:48.399> o<00:01:48.549> variance<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.210> that's

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
basically a snap o variance and that's

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.660 
basically a snap o variance and that's
it<00:01:50.229> has<00:01:50.500> pretty<00:01:50.680> much<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.890> exact<00:01:51.189> same<00:01:51.219> design

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
it has pretty much the exact same design

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.510 
it has pretty much the exact same design
as<00:01:52.170> Moore's<00:01:53.170> original<00:01:53.590> design<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.310> uses

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
as Moore's original design but it uses

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.109 
as Moore's original design but it uses
this<00:01:55.289> catch<00:01:56.289> mechanism<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.979> I<00:01:57.310> built<00:01:57.909> on<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
this catch mechanism that I built on the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.679 
this catch mechanism that I built on the
blast<00:01:58.329> Buster<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:58.960> place<00:01:59.200> closer<00:01:59.890> together

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
blast Buster and place closer together

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.630 
blast Buster and place closer together
so<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:03.280> over<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.549> little<00:02:03.579> bit<00:02:03.820> more<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.890> it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
so going over it a little bit more it it

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.490 
so going over it a little bit more it it
looks<00:02:06.850> really<00:02:07.210> awesome<00:02:07.329> my

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
looks really awesome my

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.050 
looks really awesome my
much<00:02:08.740> better<00:02:08.890> than<00:02:09.100> postman<00:02:09.490> does<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.030> that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
much better than postman does and that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.760 
much better than postman does and that
it's<00:02:10.390> really<00:02:10.720> really<00:02:10.900> simple<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.740> really

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's really really simple it's really

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.990 
it's really really simple it's really
really<00:02:12.160> clean<00:02:12.340> I'll<00:02:12.580> give<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> nice<00:02:12.850> little

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
really clean I'll give you a nice little

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.900 
really clean I'll give you a nice little
closer<00:02:13.240> look<00:02:13.450> right<00:02:13.630> here<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.820> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
closer look right here you can see it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.040 
closer look right here you can see it
right<00:02:16.000> there<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> might<00:02:19.450> prefer<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:19.840> look

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
right there so I might prefer this look

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.470 
right there so I might prefer this look
of<00:02:20.320> any<00:02:20.440> sort<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.740> regular<00:02:21.370> snap<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:21.910> it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
of any sort of regular snap because it's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
of any sort of regular snap because it's
the<00:02:22.990> trigger<00:02:23.350> looks<00:02:23.650> cleaner<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.940> more<00:02:25.660> more

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
the trigger looks cleaner and more more

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.060 
the trigger looks cleaner and more more
sort<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.100> streamlined<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.700> design<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
sort of streamlined in the design and so

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.740 
sort of streamlined in the design and so
what<00:02:30.190> was<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> cell<00:02:30.580> done<00:02:30.790> by<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.510> time

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
what was the cell done by this time

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.060 
what was the cell done by this time
around<00:02:31.930> because<00:02:32.080> last<00:02:32.290> time<00:02:32.440> I'm<00:02:32.650> still<00:02:32.830> on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
around because last time I'm still on

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.720 
around because last time I'm still on
these<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.560> nail<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.520> actual

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
these the the nail that the the actual

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
these the the nail that the the actual
trigger<00:02:36.910> was<00:02:37.120> hitting<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:38.350> through

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
trigger was hitting on was going through

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.250 
trigger was hitting on was going through
the<00:02:38.880> handle<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.210> previous<00:02:40.630> blaster<00:02:41.020> and

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the handle of the previous blaster and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.410 
the handle of the previous blaster and
that<00:02:41.440> had<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> nerf<00:02:41.890> blaster<00:02:42.490> handle<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.240> so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
that had a nerf blaster handle on it so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.790 
that had a nerf blaster handle on it so
I<00:02:43.870> have<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> little<00:02:44.260> clearance<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.650> able<00:02:44.710> to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
I have a little clearance to be able to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.290 
I have a little clearance to be able to
put<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.070> through<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> hole<00:02:45.430> there<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:46.060> one

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
put it through a hole there but this one

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.230 
put it through a hole there but this one
is<00:02:47.040> obviously<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.310> wooden<00:02:48.490> handle<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.000> I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
is obviously just a wooden handle so I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.300 
is obviously just a wooden handle so I
used<00:02:49.570> I<00:02:49.990> could<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.410> aluminum<00:02:50.800> side<00:02:51.070> plates

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
used I could have aluminum side plates

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.970 
used I could have aluminum side plates
on<00:02:51.490> here<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:53.020> glue<00:02:53.260> those<00:02:53.470> onto<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.800> side

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
on here and I glue those onto the side

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340 
on here and I glue those onto the side
of<00:02:54.010> handle<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.720> what<00:02:55.900> allows<00:02:56.110> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
of handle and that is what allows the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.990 
of handle and that is what allows the
nail<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.710> go<00:02:56.830> through<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.370> still<00:02:57.670> be<00:02:57.790> able<00:02:57.850> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
nail to go through and still be able to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.280 
nail to go through and still be able to
inject<00:02:58.330> early<00:03:00.450> some<00:03:01.450> people<00:03:01.660> pointed<00:03:01.900> out<00:03:02.050> my

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
inject early some people pointed out my

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.260 
inject early some people pointed out my
last<00:03:02.470> design<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:03.070> sort<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.490> tangent<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.060> this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
last design to sort of tangent that this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.470 
last design to sort of tangent that this
was<00:03:04.450> similar<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.320> HEC<00:03:06.100> catch<00:03:06.730> design<00:03:07.120> and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
was similar to the HEC catch design and

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.160 
was similar to the HEC catch design and
that<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:09.400> used<00:03:09.850> an<00:03:10.000> externally<00:03:10.480> hinging<00:03:10.990> piece

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
that it used an externally hinging piece

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.280 
that it used an externally hinging piece
of<00:03:11.320> polycarbonate<00:03:11.470> attached<00:03:13.050> but<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.110> just

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
of polycarbonate attached but I just

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.870 
of polycarbonate attached but I just
like<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.470> point<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.489> actually<00:03:15.850> a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
like to point out that it is actually a

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.310 
like to point out that it is actually a
little<00:03:15.970> bit<00:03:16.150> different<00:03:16.420> because<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.870> HEC

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
little bit different because the HEC

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.699 
little bit different because the HEC
design<00:03:17.650> uses<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> polycarbonate<00:03:19.270> ramp<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.470> you

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
design uses a polycarbonate ramp if you

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.970 
design uses a polycarbonate ramp if you
will<00:03:21.209> that's<00:03:22.209> attached<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> trigger<00:03:23.170> to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
will that's attached to the trigger to

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420 
will that's attached to the trigger to
guide<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:26.290> guide<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.680> basically<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
guide the to guide the basically the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.520 
guide the to guide the basically the
trigger<00:03:27.700> into<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.090> slot<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.510> catches<00:03:28.870> if

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
trigger into the slot that catches if

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.740 
trigger into the slot that catches if
that<00:03:29.709> makes<00:03:29.890> any<00:03:29.950> sense<00:03:30.420> whereas<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.540> one<00:03:31.720> is

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
that makes any sense whereas this one is

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.080 
that makes any sense whereas this one is
still<00:03:32.230> much<00:03:32.500> closer<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.950> how<00:03:33.160> snap<00:03:33.520> works<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
still much closer to how snap works and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.900 
still much closer to how snap works and
back<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.720> plunger<00:03:35.470> head<00:03:35.800> as<00:03:36.070> an<00:03:36.400> epoxy<00:03:36.610> buddy

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
back the plunger head as an epoxy buddy

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.880 
back the plunger head as an epoxy buddy
ramp<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.330> that's<00:03:37.480> what<00:03:37.660> guides<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.470> nail

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
ramp and that's what guides a nail

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.220 
ramp and that's what guides a nail
that's<00:03:39.670> inside<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.270> down<00:03:40.600> into<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.050> catch

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
that's inside here down into the catch

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.820 
that's inside here down into the catch
long<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.880> similar<00:03:43.420> but<00:03:44.380> different

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
long so it's similar but different

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.500 
long so it's similar but different
enough<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.459> something<00:03:45.820> I'd<00:03:45.940> say<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.270> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
enough to be something I'd say that a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.110 
enough to be something I'd say that a
you<00:03:46.959> know<00:03:47.050> be<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> different<00:03:47.920> catch<00:03:48.070> then<00:03:48.459> than

one of the HEC would be just one of that
out<00:03:52.450> there<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.520> moving<00:03:54.520> on<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.610> other<00:03:54.730> features

used on my previous to go maze because I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.230 
used on my previous to go maze because I

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
like being able to attach CPVC just

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.240 
like being able to attach CPVC just
directly<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.660> their<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:08.020> box<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.560> juice<00:04:09.690> and

difference being that I'm using an

difference being that I'm using an

on<00:04:23.290> my<00:04:23.530> explanation<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.580> why<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.850> use<00:04:25.090> an

on my explanation of why I use an

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.200 
on my explanation of why I use an
overhang<00:04:25.570> class<00:04:26.070> homemade<00:04:27.070> video<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:28.090> that

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
overhang class homemade video and that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.940 
overhang class homemade video and that
where<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.390> was<00:04:28.540> stating<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.950> Watchers

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
where I was stating that Watchers

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.140 
where I was stating that Watchers
provide<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.250> little<00:04:30.460> bit<00:04:30.610> too<00:04:30.760> much<00:04:30.850> friction

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
provide a little bit too much friction

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.350 
provide a little bit too much friction
for<00:04:31.390> my<00:04:31.480> taste<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.850> realized<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:33.970> once

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
for my taste and I realized that once

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.580 
for my taste and I realized that once
you<00:04:34.450> get<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> watch<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.900> right<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.260> oh<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.350> should

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
you get a watch it right it oh I should

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.740 
you get a watch it right it oh I should
be<00:04:35.680> less<00:04:36.040> friction<00:04:36.310> than<00:04:36.670> an<00:04:37.120> o-ring<00:04:37.240> but

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
be less friction than an o-ring but

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.380 
be less friction than an o-ring but
thing<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.400> when<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.460> buy<00:04:39.610> them<00:04:39.820> when<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.270> buy

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
thing is when you buy them when you buy

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.600 
thing is when you buy them when you buy
the<00:04:40.450> washers<00:04:40.870> they<00:04:41.470> come<00:04:41.650> oversized<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.520> so

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
the washers they come oversized and so

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.040 
the washers they come oversized and so
you<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.970> get<00:04:43.360> them<00:04:43.510> into<00:04:43.660> some<00:04:43.750> sort<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.960> a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
you have to get them into some sort of a

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.690 
you have to get them into some sort of a
cup<00:04:44.230> shape<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.710> able<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.920> fit<00:04:45.130> one<00:04:45.430> or<00:04:45.580> two

previous no mate did really well this

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240 
previous no mate did really well this
one<00:05:13.510> doesn't<00:05:14.260> for<00:05:14.470> whatever<00:05:14.590> reason<00:05:14.950> but<00:05:15.100> it's

one doesn't for whatever reason but it's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.980 
one doesn't for whatever reason but it's
still<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.820> still<00:05:15.850> not<00:05:16.120> bad

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
still it's still not bad

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.320 
still it's still not bad
so<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.470> can<00:05:17.650> show<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.830> here<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:18.970> used<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.240> say

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
so I can show you here it used to say

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.370 
so I can show you here it used to say
fourteen<00:05:19.900> inch<00:05:20.020> barrel

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
fourteen inch barrel

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.380 
fourteen inch barrel
I<00:05:20.530> haven't<00:05:20.980> well<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:21.550> haven't<00:05:22.000> really<00:05:22.150> tested

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
I haven't well I haven't really tested

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.660 
I haven't well I haven't really tested
this<00:05:22.770> exactly<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.950> see<00:05:24.100> what<00:05:24.310> barrel<00:05:24.520> length

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
this exactly to see what barrel length

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.920 
this exactly to see what barrel length
is<00:05:24.790> right<00:05:24.970> but<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.180> would<00:05:25.390> imagine<00:05:25.600> something

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
is right but I would imagine something

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.720 
is right but I would imagine something
like<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.140> fourteen<00:05:26.470> inch<00:05:26.530> barrel<00:05:26.770> it's<00:05:27.550> that

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
like a fourteen inch barrel it's that

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.840 
like a fourteen inch barrel it's that
way<00:05:27.910> he's<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.620> seal<00:05:29.620> on<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:30.990> so<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.530> not<00:05:32.620> bad

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
way he's a seal on this so it's not bad

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.260 
way he's a seal on this so it's not bad
not<00:05:33.850> great<00:05:34.030> but<00:05:35.670> it's<00:05:36.670> good<00:05:36.820> enough<00:05:37.000> it's

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
not great but it's good enough it's

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.300 
not great but it's good enough it's
still<00:05:37.300> part<00:05:37.600> of<00:05:37.630> twenty<00:05:37.870> four<00:05:38.080> so<00:05:38.950> I'm<00:05:39.190> not

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
still part of twenty four so I'm not

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.750 
still part of twenty four so I'm not
really<00:05:39.730> about<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:40.090> complain<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:42.580> draw

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
really about to complain and the draw

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.670 
really about to complain and the draw
itself<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.330> has<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.480> bouquet<00:05:43.810> 26<00:05:44.230> inside<00:05:44.500> there

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
itself it has a bouquet 26 inside there

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.510 
itself it has a bouquet 26 inside there
and<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.820> draw<00:05:46.000> is<00:05:46.740> just<00:05:47.740> below<00:05:48.070> seven

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and it's the draw is just below seven

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.270 
and it's the draw is just below seven
inches<00:05:48.790> so<00:05:49.210> it's<00:05:50.140> very<00:05:50.650> nearly<00:05:50.980> full

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
inches so it's very nearly full

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.850 
inches so it's very nearly full
progression<00:05:51.730> it's<00:05:52.169> it's<00:05:53.169> plenty<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.500> drops

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
progression it's it's plenty of drops

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.320 
progression it's it's plenty of drops
it's<00:05:54.220> more<00:05:54.400> than<00:05:54.550> more<00:05:55.060> than<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.300> ever

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
up here it almost looks like a site for

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.720 
up here it almost looks like a site for
the<00:06:23.730> gun<00:06:23.910> and<00:06:24.120> obviously<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:25.290> know<00:06:25.560> it's

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
the gun and obviously I know it's

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.590 
the gun and obviously I know it's
doesn't<00:06:26.730> actually<00:06:26.910> do<00:06:27.120> anything<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.480> doesn't

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
doesn't actually do anything it doesn't

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.090 
doesn't actually do anything it doesn't
really<00:06:27.750> work<00:06:27.930> but<00:06:28.170> it<00:06:28.500> looks<00:06:28.680> cool<00:06:28.890> it's<00:06:29.010> fun

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
really work but it looks cool it's fun

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.320 
really work but it looks cool it's fun
to<00:06:29.220> play<00:06:29.370> with

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.940 

yeah<00:06:33.330> about<00:06:33.840> that<00:06:34.050> though<00:06:34.260> that's<00:06:34.890> really

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
yeah about that though that's really

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.370 
yeah about that though that's really
about<00:06:35.190> it<00:06:35.250> I<00:06:35.870> intended<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:36.930> keep<00:06:37.140> it<00:06:37.290> pretty

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
about it I intended to keep it pretty

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.920 
about it I intended to keep it pretty
simple<00:06:37.680> in<00:06:37.830> this<00:06:37.920> blaster<00:06:38.310> since<00:06:38.930> that's

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
simple in this blaster since that's

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.120 
simple in this blaster since that's
basically<00:06:40.230> what<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:40.530> point<00:06:40.710> of<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.830> snap<00:06:40.980> oh

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
basically what the point of the snap oh

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.950 
basically what the point of the snap oh
is<00:06:41.310> to<00:06:41.640> make<00:06:42.060> you<00:06:42.450> know<00:06:42.540> something<00:06:42.810> that's

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
is to make you know something that's

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.730 
is to make you know something that's
simple<00:06:43.230> that<00:06:43.410> will<00:06:43.500> fire<00:06:43.650> reliably<00:06:44.870> so<00:06:45.870> yeah

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
simple that will fire reliably so yeah

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.150 
simple that will fire reliably so yeah
last<00:06:47.580> one<00:06:47.760> I<00:06:47.850> called<00:06:48.090> a<00:06:48.210> pump<00:06:49.110> em<00:06:49.410> snap<00:06:49.860> and

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
last one I called a pump em snap and

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.770 
last one I called a pump em snap and
saving<00:06:50.730> for<00:06:50.760> moderately<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:51.570> snap

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
saving for moderately and the snap

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.940 
saving for moderately and the snap
acronym<00:06:52.260> so<00:06:53.190> I<00:06:53.220> figured<00:06:53.610> I'll<00:06:53.700> call<00:06:53.850> this<00:06:54.000> the

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:54.950 
acronym so I figured I'll call this the

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.580 
acronym so I figured I'll call this the
snap<00:06:55.950> or<00:06:56.190> they<00:06:56.490> M<00:06:56.700> snap<00:06:57.030> bow<00:06:57.270> or<00:06:57.720> MSP<00:06:58.200> for<00:06:58.230> short

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
snap or they M snap bow or MSP for short

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.800 
snap or they M snap bow or MSP for short
since<00:06:59.100> I<00:06:59.310> would<00:06:59.370> like<00:06:59.910> to<00:07:00.030> be<00:07:00.150> cute<00:07:00.420> my<00:07:00.780> little

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
since I would like to be cute my little

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.800 
since I would like to be cute my little
classroom<00:07:01.260> whatever<00:07:02.210> so<00:07:03.210> we're<00:07:03.510> all<00:07:03.600> really

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
really happy with this I turned out

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.160 
really happy with this I turned out
really<00:07:05.790> really<00:07:06.060> simple<00:07:06.360> cooking<00:07:06.780> which<00:07:07.020> is

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
really really simple cooking which is

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.170 
really really simple cooking which is
doing<00:07:07.650> in<00:07:07.770> my<00:07:07.860> opinion<00:07:08.190> I<00:07:08.340> like<00:07:08.730> that<00:07:09.060> look

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
doing in my opinion I like that look

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.330 
doing in my opinion I like that look
it's<00:07:09.720> really<00:07:09.900> clean<00:07:10.140> really<00:07:10.440> sort<00:07:11.220> of<00:07:11.250> a

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
it's really clean really sort of a

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.520 
it's really clean really sort of a
streamlined<00:07:11.610> design<00:07:11.910> so<00:07:12.480> I'm<00:07:12.720> overall<00:07:13.290> quite

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
streamlined design so I'm overall quite

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.520 
streamlined design so I'm overall quite
happy<00:07:13.770> with<00:07:13.860> that<00:07:13.920> so<00:07:14.390> now<00:07:15.410> generally<00:07:16.410> I'd

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
happy with that so now generally I'd

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.140 
happy with that so now generally I'd
show<00:07:16.620> arranged<00:07:16.980> uh<00:07:17.070> stuff<00:07:17.250> with<00:07:17.370> this<00:07:17.520> but<00:07:17.850> it

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
show arranged uh stuff with this but it

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.000 
show arranged uh stuff with this but it
basically<00:07:18.330> reaches<00:07:18.810> the<00:07:18.900> same<00:07:19.080> brain<00:07:19.560> just<00:07:19.770> by

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
basically reaches the same brain just by

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.890 
basically reaches the same brain just by
buffer<00:07:20.460> to<00:07:20.580> homemade<00:07:20.910> so<00:07:21.150> I'm<00:07:21.240> pretty<00:07:21.450> bubbly

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
buffer to homemade so I'm pretty bubbly
