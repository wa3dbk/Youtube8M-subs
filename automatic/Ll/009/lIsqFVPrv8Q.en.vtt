00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.089
 Today I want to talk about the subject of gas 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.990
 to report 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.520
 Welcome to a reportage 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.480
 you may count I have here a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 spanish gas cylinder in a gas tank 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.289
 but more on that later 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.599
 Let's start at the front I have for 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 Determined me or for us what we here 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 about gas when we need to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.829
 For example, two three months to spain 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.090
 drive and I'm on it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.950
 the following result 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 we come with an eleven kilo bottle 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.520
 we will not have to heat about 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.440
 twelve days out of ten for us 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 heat must be reduced to that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 maximum ten days where I have to say 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.460
 we leave the fridge on gas 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.649
 run quite simply because of the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.719
 electricity is relatively expensive mostly 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.040
 pitches in campsites in the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.080
 cut is 50 cents per kilowatt 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.729
 calculated for electricity so you can do better 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.770
 the fridge and that's how we do it 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.590
 at least let it run on gas and we 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 shower every day real estate of course 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.810
 and therefore the consumption would be so 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.960
 not far with two gas bottles 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.430
 we also have a gastank 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.290
 but he would not 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 last for the entire time 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.780
 So I came up with the idea resp 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 had offered a gas bottle in 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 buy spain 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.299
 I have this gas bottle for 20 euros 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.189
 purchased at a flea market 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.100
 of course this is not the rule but 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.149
 I know that some places 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.250
 bottles sell that one 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.320
 Gas stations can buy bottles 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.329
 you have to be in spain a bit 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 make other camper the smart 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.490
 maybe not going back because 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.939
 sell your bottle 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.710
 There are different possibilities 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.750
 if you have such a bottle too 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.750
 Then do it like that when I go back 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.149
 was from spain I take a full with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.030
 Replace them there so before I left 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.350
 spain go out and get a full one 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 bottle with to germany 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.490
 next time I come back 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.550
 I start using the new one 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.380
 do not bridge the new bottle 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.270
 and then go so pure by spain 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 in the moment when it is empty I go 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.110
 also my reserve bottle and exchange 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.720
 this as soon as it is possible again against 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.090
 I have a full one in Spain 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.010
 No problem if I stay there longer 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.710
 Stop the topic of gas who now with 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.870
 Five bottle should not have more 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.830
 the big problem is enough now 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.300
 lpg petrol stations that also offer gas 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.680
 or sell gas 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.520
 you just have a corresponding one 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.010
 adapter I have the same show 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.490
 now for the gas bottle again back 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.890
 and indeed you need an adapter as well 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.780
 and there is one here 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.130
 various forms of this one too 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.960
 different possibilities 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.230
 I bought that in Spain in 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.210
 a terraria is important here in front 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.390
 sits again such a brass connection 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.420
 with a seal so must 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.460
 be sure to be on it with it the densest 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.790
 the the connection of the self gas 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.720
 connection so you have to serve 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.860
 One can also buy zigly in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.490
 acquire germany on the internet 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.890
 I saw 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.340
 but the gas expert would have to look 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.240
 There you will find different adapters as well 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.040
 for spain 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.690
 how the thing is built up and 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.520
 is connected then shows the same 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.530
 again the connection for the spanish 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.260
 Bottle is very different from ours 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.040
 It is best to call it both hands and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.630
 can the moving lower part 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.740
 pull back and then over the connection 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.840
 put the bottle 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.340
 with the red button around at the connection 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.910
 you can open the bottle and 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.730
 shut down 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 Now you screw the connection you 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.760
 Otherwise to our German bottle 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.140
 screwed to the connection of this 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.820
 Spanish bottle at the filled 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.590
 bottle around the closure is a 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.480
 plastic cap over it 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.780
 Of course you have to deduct and 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.669
 throw away 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.660
 I connect the Spanish 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.970
 connection 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.520
 previously it before install the bottle 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.550
 that is easier and yes the whole in 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.810
 Lingen is better because the connection for 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.660
 the second bottle with me something 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.130
 is unfavorable and could control on 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.110
 Connection from the Spanish bottle 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.300
 I just have an insulation of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.210
 taken a heating pipe and thus 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.100
 the hose is protected 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.990
 various suppliers of gas bottles in 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.420
 spain, I chose the market 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.430
 Repsol decided here is important 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.190
 black stripes around the bottle 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.760
 the states that propane and no 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.760
 good at 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.930
 for all who have a bottle now 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.720
 or have a tank that need to 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.010
 refuel gas from lpg adapter 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.840
 partially is the existing one 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.340
 Gas stations would not always be that way 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.980
 I suggest to buy that 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.400
 You can find something on the internet at one 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.950
 gas woman expert, for example, but also 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.090
 maybe somewhere else here in the picture 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.090
 you can see on the left 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.350
 then we see again the two adapters 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.330
 for gas bottles very much a middle of that is 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.660
 I like it very much 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.420
 Well 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.760
 right one is the one you also keep in the 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.800
 the trade in which is missing but now the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.430
 seal which I do not think so well 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.550
 therefore, the favorite with me is the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.920
 adapter connection in the middle yes man 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.810
 should also remember the height the guest 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.030
 Fach is not always very high so that 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.500
 the construction height of the connection then 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.470
 maybe it is somehow way 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.600
 So there is then in the middle of something 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.360
 smaller and then he fits 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.770
 yes you see the connection does not 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.370
 So I would not do the poetry 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.370
 use 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.480
 that was such a small overview of 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.070
 Gas in Spain I hope I could 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.260
 to convey a bit of information 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.420
 Of course you can not explain everything 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.350
 and say that's it for today 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.540
 have been 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.990
 thanks for watching and his at bis 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.990
 next time
