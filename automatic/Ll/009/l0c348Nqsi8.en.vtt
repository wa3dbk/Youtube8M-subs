00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 a safe wheel ready to react to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 any more solicitation of the land 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.610
 rough for light in weight and with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 safety standards for those at 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.220
 handlebar greatly increased everything 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 this is possible thanks to a valve 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 of new conception based on the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.110
 simplicity its genius and system of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 uneasy conceived and created by alberto 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.360
 deanesi many years of practice and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 specific competence resulted in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.590
 application searches up to invent 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 this innovative solution so far 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 we have been used to reasoning with the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.580
 traditional room solutions 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.740
 palmer and to black air 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.860
 here the novelty consists of 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.640
 matching the same palmer wheel e 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.300
 of the tub es 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.010
 but to do it he needs a valve 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.500
 specially studied de nisi 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.590
 precisely and of a special processing 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.259
 on the rim to fit the in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.170
 practice the diagnosis consists of a 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.969
 valve that hosts another the first 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.249
 allows to send the area inside 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.560
 of the to black that naturally remains 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:23.450
 outside the second allows you to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.450
 inflate the palmer that remains inside 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.420
 a more protected wheel comes out of it 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:33.960
 palmer treated with a pressure that goes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.789
 from 10 to 15 atmospheres swells and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 so it presses on the edges of the tire 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.219
 external guaranteeing consequently the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.310
 therefore, it protects against the possible 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.770
 cuts and from the classic pizzica tourÃ© e 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.049
 at the same time it keeps it from stalling 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.230
 nature because it is firmly attached 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.420
 inside of 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.190
 the palmer itself behaves like a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.810
 real second tire 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.150
 internal however more swollen canceled doubts 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 I keep the wheel deflated for more 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.320
 adherence and risk of breakage 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.540
 or I keep it or it swells more and more 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.670
 the chances of a slip with 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.240
 dialysis this question not 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.240
 will exist more 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.200
 these the steps represent i 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.090
 greater dangers for the wheel than i 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.130
 walking down them quickly 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.250
 he suffers a blow every time he can 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.720
 be fatal to his estate 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.840
 the witness is executed with one 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.780
 pressure of 06 atmospheres the to black is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.360
 ineffective the wheel is compromised and that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.800
 is carrying out the activity is forced to 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.870
 stop 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.090
 same fate for the other one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 of the air chamber being pinched 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.200
 with violence that ends up giving way 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.810
 quickly 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.420
 here is the test performed with the goddess 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.200
 nisi the wheel guarantees a good 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.540
 estate 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.660
 let's lower the pressure again and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 let's try a new descent here too 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.270
 seal is guaranteed we go even further 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 let's try to test this system 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.239
 innovative even at zero atmospheres 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.850
 the wheel is literally on the ground therefore 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.910
 with traditional systems it would be al 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.040
 maximum risk of breakage instead 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.350
 diagnosis resists as the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.570
 subsequent inflation that returns us 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.910
 a perfect wheel despite the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.420
 violent stresses of the descent 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.700
 on the steps 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
 the main use for this system 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.069
 innovative and certainly for downhill 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.050
 and the superenduro but can be extended 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.989
 of course to cross country and 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.000
 any other discipline and think 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.150
 the use of a wheel of this kind 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.040
 on the pave of paris roubaix 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 of this step the principle can 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 become useful also beyond the concept 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.870
 of bicycle to land in others 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.870
 fields 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.440
 in addition, a tire can be used 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.600
 light and the palmer itself weighs less 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.560
 of the inner tube goddess I set speed and 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.560
 security together
