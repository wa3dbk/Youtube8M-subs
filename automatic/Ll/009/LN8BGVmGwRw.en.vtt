00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:25.279
 but then we candle 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 I update from it it will turn out such 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:40.530
 here we cut the most important thing to catch 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:46.879
 not to overdo it a moment 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.879
 it will start to build up enough 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.930
 bottle core 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.649
 chain mail. 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.820
 I'm trying to get around and come up with how not 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.580
 hold together 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:13.240
 other descent such constructions 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.240
 put a rose there this bottle 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.430
 however, you need to draw anything 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.430
 at first 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.860
 just gently as long as there is not and omit 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:03.150
 look at how the stars are filled 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 what to leave inside thicker 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.970
 what's left outside 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.970
 hook on the antennae the best
