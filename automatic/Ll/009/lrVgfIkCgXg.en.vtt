just<00:01:49.380> gold-plated<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> deal<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.790> I

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
just gold-plated or what the deal is I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.480 
just gold-plated or what the deal is I
know<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.689> solid<00:01:52.140> gold<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.950> would

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
know it's not solid gold but I would

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.100 
know it's not solid gold but I would
imagine<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.509> gold-plated

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
imagine that it's gold-plated

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.950 
imagine that it's gold-plated
so<00:01:56.800> anything<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.000> bit<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.240> gold<00:01:58.510> or<00:01:58.780> gold

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
so anything with a bit of gold or gold

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.950 
so anything with a bit of gold or gold
Colorado<00:01:59.470> dipole<00:01:59.830> side<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:01.420> will

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
Colorado dipole side and I will

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.720 
Colorado dipole side and I will
eventually<00:02:02.500> do<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.920> video<00:02:03.250> when<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.490> get<00:02:03.700> a

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
eventually do a video when I get a

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.780 
eventually do a video when I get a
chance<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.980> figure<00:02:05.980> out<00:02:06.220> how<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.430> do<00:02:06.640> it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
chance to figure out how to do it

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.340 
chance to figure out how to do it
especially<00:02:07.480> probably<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.229> spring

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
especially probably in the spring

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.650 
especially probably in the spring
because<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:08.800> want<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:09.250> outside<00:02:09.460> I<00:02:09.910> will

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
because I want to do this outside I will

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.440 
because I want to do this outside I will
I'll<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> video<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:13.120> letting<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I'll do a video on the on letting it

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.190 
I'll do a video on the on letting it
soak<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.530> acids<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:16.570> right<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
soak and in the acids but right now I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.640 
soak and in the acids but right now I
have<00:02:17.890> about<00:02:18.450> thirty<00:02:19.450> thirty<00:02:19.960> or<00:02:20.110> forty<00:02:20.410> phones

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
have about thirty thirty or forty phones

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.340 
have about thirty thirty or forty phones
that<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.370> will<00:02:22.030> break<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.270> pot<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:22.900> like

that I will break a pot this is like

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.810 
that I will break a pot this is like
this<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.010> probably<00:02:24.280> about<00:02:24.370> twelve<00:02:24.700> or

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
this is probably about twelve or

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.330 
this is probably about twelve or
thirteen<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.390> them<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> I'll<00:02:29.980> save<00:02:30.190> those

thirteen of them and I'll save those

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.040 
thirteen of them and I'll save those
aside<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.910> lithium<00:02:31.270> batteries<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.750> don't<00:02:31.930> know

aside the lithium batteries I don't know
I<00:02:32.290> don't<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:32.950> those<00:02:33.160> eventually<00:02:33.820> will<00:02:34.150> be

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
I don't know if those eventually will be

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.000 
I don't know if those eventually will be
worth<00:02:34.450> something<00:02:34.900> or<00:02:35.020> not<00:02:35.140> or<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.500> they're<00:02:35.709> if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
worth something or not or if they're if

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.310 
worth something or not or if they're if
they're<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.280> sellable<00:02:36.790> item<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.810> then

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
they're a sellable item and then

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.580 
they're a sellable item and then
according<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> gate<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.910> video<00:02:40.900> that

according to the gate to the video that
I've<00:02:41.740> been<00:02:41.890> watching<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:43.330> screens<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.990> LCD

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
I've been watching the screens the LCD

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
I've been watching the screens the LCD
screens<00:02:44.950> those<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.459> something<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:45.970> them

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
screens those have something in them

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.120 
screens those have something in them
that<00:02:46.209> are<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:49.500> worth<00:02:50.500> selling<00:02:50.860> at<00:02:50.980> or

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that are actually worth selling at or

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.980 
that are actually worth selling at or
worth<00:02:51.340> keeping<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.480> will<00:02:52.570> take<00:02:52.690> up<00:02:52.840> much

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
worth keeping so it will take up much

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.890 
worth keeping so it will take up much
space<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.560> started<00:02:54.010> keeping<00:02:54.310> those<00:02:57.900> that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
space so I started keeping those that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.720 
space so I started keeping those that
I've<00:02:59.050> saved<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.740> I<00:02:59.770> will<00:03:00.040> pull<00:03:00.220> all<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.519> gold

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
I've saved so I will pull all the gold

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.690 
I've saved so I will pull all the gold
off<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.860> Adam<00:03:03.160> Hall<00:03:03.310> together<00:03:03.489> I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
off these that is Adam Hall together I

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.630 
off these that is Adam Hall together I
guess<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.300> same<00:03:04.480> stuff<00:03:04.750> so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
guess it's all the same stuff so

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
guess it's all the same stuff so
anything<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.670> Joel<00:03:07.000> tell<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.420> I've<00:03:07.540> been

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
anything that Joel tell that I've been

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.290 
anything that Joel tell that I've been
keeping<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.830> know<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.790> lot<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.030> its<00:03:10.209> on

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
keeping so I know a lot of its on

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.810 
keeping so I know a lot of its on
plastic<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.590> believe<00:03:12.280> these<00:03:12.459> are<00:03:12.519> discs

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
plastic but I believe these are discs

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.290 
plastic but I believe these are discs
gold-plated<00:03:13.420> tips<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:14.620> all<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.970> all<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
gold-plated tips on all the on all the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.050 
gold-plated tips on all the on all the
connections<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.500> I'll<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.459> video<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.850> them

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
connections so I'll do a video on them

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.680 
connections so I'll do a video on them
and<00:03:19.269> once<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.350> once<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:21.360> pull<00:03:22.360> them<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:22.540> together

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
and once I once I pull them all together

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.720 
and once I once I pull them all together
and<00:03:23.019> get<00:03:23.590> some<00:03:23.739> good<00:03:23.920> weather<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.190> get<00:03:24.400> outside

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and get some good weather I get outside

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.729 
and get some good weather I get outside
let<00:03:25.450> them<00:03:25.630> soak<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.019> believe<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.410> only<00:03:26.530> let

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
let them soak I believe you only let

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.380 
let them soak I believe you only let
them<00:03:26.830> soak<00:03:26.980> for<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.250> day<00:03:27.400> or<00:03:27.519> two<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
them soak for a day or two and it

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.710 
them soak for a day or two and it
separates<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.790> gold<00:03:31.480> off<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
separates all this all this gold off the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.710 
separates all this all this gold off the
off<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.560> boards<00:03:33.150> along<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:34.390> some<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> the

off the boards along with some of the
other<00:03:34.840> credit<00:03:35.170> as<00:03:35.260> well<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:36.720> there's<00:03:37.720> more

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
other credit as well but there's more

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.470 
other credit as well but there's more
steps<00:03:38.230> than<00:03:38.320> that<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:39.580> do

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
steps than that you have to actually do

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.460 
steps than that you have to actually do
another<00:03:41.880> I'm<00:03:42.880> not

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
another I'm not

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.230 
another I'm not
keen<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.740> right<00:03:43.950> now<00:03:44.100> but<00:03:44.310> at<00:03:44.460> least<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
keen on right now but at least I can I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.150 
keen on right now but at least I can I
can<00:03:45.600> get<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.020> get<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.410> flake<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.680> the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
can get it to get the flake that the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.540 
can get it to get the flake that the

pull off there's a lot of aluminium and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.790 
pull off there's a lot of aluminium and
stuff<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.240> here<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.320> know<00:03:58.410> I'll<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.650> add

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
stuff in here and you know I'll just add

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.610 
stuff in here and you know I'll just add
to<00:03:58.830> my<00:03:59.100> piles<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.670> doesn't<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.540> doesn't<00:04:01.260> hurt

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
to my piles it doesn't know doesn't hurt

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.460 
to my piles it doesn't know doesn't hurt
to<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:02.700> separate<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.270> out<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.630> well<00:04:03.810> it's

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
to to separate that out as well it's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.100 
to to separate that out as well it's
easy<00:04:04.770> enough<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.280> magnet<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.020> you<00:04:07.020> know

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
easy enough with a magnet and you know

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.500 
easy enough with a magnet and you know
so<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.350> guess<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:10.440> that's<00:04:10.830> what<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.510> let

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
so I guess but that's what I do and let

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.270 
so I guess but that's what I do and let
this<00:04:12.660> mark<00:04:12.900> them<00:04:13.080> when<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> when<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.650> get<00:04:13.770> them<00:04:14.100> I

this mark them when I when I get them I

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.490 
this mark them when I when I get them I

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
there is in the gold it takes fifty or

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.700 
there is in the gold it takes fifty or
sixty<00:04:56.400> phones<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.330> equal<00:04:58.020> one<00:04:58.260> ounce<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.650> gold

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
sixty phones to equal one ounce of gold

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.600 
sixty phones to equal one ounce of gold
so<00:04:59.520> if<00:05:00.060> that's<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.450> case<00:05:00.630> then<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.919> know<00:05:02.040> if

twelve twelve hundred dollars an ounce
right<00:05:07.320> now<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.190> if<00:05:08.460> that's<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.760> case<00:05:08.970> then<00:05:09.360> you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
right now so if that's the case then you

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.930 
right now so if that's the case then you
know<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.380> little<00:05:10.500> box<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.979> phones<00:05:11.190> with<00:05:11.729> this

right<00:05:44.970> now<00:05:45.030> and

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.390 

and<00:05:50.270> go<00:05:50.419> from<00:05:50.570> there<00:05:50.720> now<00:05:50.930> some<00:05:51.440> of<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.620> videos

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
and go from there now some of the videos

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.270 
and go from there now some of the videos
especially<00:05:53.030> on<00:05:53.389> these<00:05:53.540> these<00:05:53.990> memory<00:05:54.919> boards

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
especially on these these memory boards

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.629 
especially on these these memory boards
here<00:05:55.520> they<00:05:56.060> take<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:57.169> snip<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.070> fingers<00:05:58.460> off

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
here they take and snip the fingers off

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.200 
here they take and snip the fingers off
that<00:05:58.880> that<00:05:59.150> gold<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.570> gold<00:05:59.810> pieces<00:06:01.090> but<00:06:02.090> if

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
that that gold the gold pieces but if

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.870 
that that gold the gold pieces but if
you<00:06:02.330> look<00:06:02.509> all<00:06:02.990> in<00:06:03.050> here<00:06:03.620> there's<00:06:04.310> more<00:06:04.580> gold

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
you look all in here there's more gold

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.450 
you look all in here there's more gold
than<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.300> so<00:06:05.630> I<00:06:05.870> mean<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:06.919> doesn't<00:06:07.100> take<00:06:07.250> up

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
than that so I mean it doesn't take up

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.610 
than that so I mean it doesn't take up
that<00:06:07.490> much<00:06:07.639> space<00:06:07.820> I<00:06:08.360> wouldn't<00:06:09.169> imagine<00:06:09.320> it

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
that much space I wouldn't imagine it

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.960 
that much space I wouldn't imagine it
would<00:06:09.710> be<00:06:09.830> that<00:06:09.949> much<00:06:10.100> harder<00:06:10.280> to<00:06:10.460> soak<00:06:10.759> the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
would be that much harder to soak the

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.840 
would be that much harder to soak the
whole<00:06:11.150> board<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:12.710> get<00:06:12.889> every<00:06:13.130> last<00:06:13.310> bit<00:06:13.520> off

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
whole board and get every last bit off

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.560 
whole board and get every last bit off
then<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.759> you<00:06:16.759> know<00:06:16.880> sniff<00:06:17.180> that<00:06:17.330> stuff

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
then and to you know sniff that stuff

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.930 
then and to you know sniff that stuff
off<00:06:17.750> but<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:18.650> mean<00:06:19.310> maybe<00:06:19.520> they're<00:06:19.669> doing<00:06:19.880> it

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
off but I mean maybe they're doing it

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.670 
off but I mean maybe they're doing it
for<00:06:20.090> a<00:06:20.120> reason<00:06:20.270> so<00:06:20.570> again<00:06:20.960> I'm<00:06:21.139> I'm<00:06:21.320> in<00:06:21.590> the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
for a reason so again I'm I'm in the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.409 
for a reason so again I'm I'm in the
research<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.280> collection<00:06:22.880> phase<00:06:23.060> right<00:06:23.360> now

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
research and collection phase right now

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.870 
research and collection phase right now
so<00:06:24.289> I<00:06:24.650> will<00:06:24.919> pull<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.220> rest<00:06:25.370> of<00:06:25.520> these<00:06:25.610> phones

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
so I will pull the rest of these phones

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.189 
so I will pull the rest of these phones
