00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello the recipe of pablos is delicious in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.219
 the blender will put 3 egg whites 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.440
 that we have already separated the yolks and what 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.749
 we will put the maximum city 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 for about three minutes from 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.160
 the three minutes we will see that it has already 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.120
 assembled at the point of snow we stopped it what 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.120
 open we see that it is perfectly and 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.440
 then we are going to put it by adding some 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.000
 300 or 230 grams of sugar that we will go 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.009
 adding little by little teaspoon 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.949
 teaspoon so that it is integrated 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.140
 well and we'll let it beat also a couple 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.350
 of minutes if you need a little more 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.170
 a little more we will add then the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.010
 chemical yeast something less than a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.890
 small teaspoon 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 and after those three minutes we have 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.870
 said then let's see if it's in its 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.659
 point so that it is at its point we have 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.210
 to take with your fingers a bit and at 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.789
 crush it see that there are no pimples left 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.560
 sugar we will have them in a paper of 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.549
 oven it is important that it be paper of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.210
 oven another way does not look good and the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.729
 We will put the form that suits us 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.310
 I here wanted to make a kind of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.190
 thick crown with the center part 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.710
 As you can see I'm making a hole 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.940
 because there is going to be a mousse of 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 white chocolate and we will also put the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.450
 company 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.590
 it is always good that this layer is thick 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.200
 that after the meringue we're going to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 put in the oven at 130 for one hour 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.110
 approximately it will get hard on the outside 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.610
 and soft inside 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.410
 meanwhile we will do 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.710
 of we remove in a scoop 150 grams of 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.920
 white chocolate with one hundred and 250 grams 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.480
 of liquid cream or cream we will put it 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.350
 to heat until it has melted 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.950
 at all and we're also going to put 3 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.840
 egg whites in this case participated 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 and the buds of the previous one are going to 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.300
 beat while riding the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.210
 previous clearings we will add about 60 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.280
 grams of 60 to 100 grams of sugar 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.600
 we will beat well until they whiten 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.600
 and we are going to add 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.610
 we are going to add 50 grams of 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610
 Butter 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.230
 little by little to integrate it well 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.290
 beating constantly when you 're 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.480
 perfectly integrated as seen in 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.379
 because this is the time 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 add the melted white chocolate that 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.080
 we will also do it a lot 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.840
 slowly we will put then 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.410
 a little vanilla paste that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.490
 It will give a very good taste in the liquid and 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:13.240
 we will remove it well so that it is integrated 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.960
 and then it will be time to put the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.910
 clear that we have ridden of that 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.580
 characterized that we have seen that they have 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.320
 stayed firm enough 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.680
 wrapping the melted chocolate with the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.030
 other elements and the clear ones when 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.160
 is completely mixed we will put it 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.980
 in the fridge until you drench 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.690
 samus I have taken it out too soon and 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.910
 we'll see later, a little bit of 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.070
 bottom liquid in a little bit we are going to 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.730
 put a water bottom with a couple of 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.240
 spoonfuls of sugar and we will also put 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.550
 a couple of tablespoons of a jam 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.920
 I made homemade cranberries and 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.220
 raspberries this will be a cul and that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.500
 will serve to put it in the end over 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.660
 as decoration and also with flavor 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.510
 state 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.510
 a raspberry gives it a point of acid and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.230
 Blueberries are very rich past 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.870
 now we see how it sounds because it is 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.270
 it was quite hard and inside not 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.850
 we have cut the paper and the same 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.580
 on a plate we will finish 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.770
 cut it out because taking it off can do 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.800
 that we are destructed is beautiful 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.140
 crown that remains as a kind of 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.900
 dancer so we have discussed above 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.180
 we are going to put the chocolate mousse 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.410
 I already say that I took too much 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.249
 soon from the fridge because we had 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.499
 hurry 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.929
 and on top we are going to place strawberries 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:44.139
 some chopped and other whole as 

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:47.060
 we see in the video above we are going to 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.150
 add the culin 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.040
 tram bag and cranberry 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.830
 that will give you an extraordinary flavor 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.990
 and it will also increase the color and 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.290
 with that we have already finished we are going to 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.960
 try it you see that when part cracks 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.670
 but inside is deliciously 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.390
 soft and brings that mix of textures 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.940
 between the hardness of merengue and the softness 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.490
 inside and then the chocolate mousse 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.020
 white and the strawberry is a mixture 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.020
 perfect for a dessert
