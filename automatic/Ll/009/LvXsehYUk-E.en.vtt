stick<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.750> then<00:02:51.900> cut<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.950> excess<00:02:52.980> off

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
stick it on and then cut the excess off

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.620 
stick it on and then cut the excess off
and<00:02:53.459> that's<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.239> way<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.600> looks

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and that's a good way and it looks

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.080 
and that's a good way and it looks
really<00:02:54.959> good<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.440> you're<00:02:55.590> selling<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.280> if

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
really good if you're selling it so if

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.640 
really good if you're selling it so if
you're<00:02:57.239> making<00:02:57.360> my<00:02:57.570> own<00:02:57.600> thing<00:02:57.840> good<00:02:57.989> grip

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
you're making my own thing good grip

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.940 
you're making my own thing good grip
product<00:02:59.070> or<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.840> completes<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.380> do

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
product or just completes you can do

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.850 
product or just completes you can do
this<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.430> looks<00:03:02.610> pretty<00:03:02.790> good<00:03:02.970> okay<00:03:06.860> I'm

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
this and it looks pretty good okay I'm

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.710 
this and it looks pretty good okay I'm
watching<00:03:08.010> I'm<00:03:08.340> away<00:03:08.549> number<00:03:08.730> two<00:03:09.000> which<00:03:09.450> just

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
watching I'm away number two which just

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.199 
watching I'm away number two which just
goes<00:03:09.890> one<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.070> foot<00:03:11.250> board<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.700> then<00:03:11.790> you

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
goes one with foot board and then you

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.539 
goes one with foot board and then you
just<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:13.530> push<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.950> down<00:03:14.100> over<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> board

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
just don't push it down over the board

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.420 
just don't push it down over the board
just<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.080> flat<00:03:16.430> and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
just make it so it's like just flat and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.949 
just make it so it's like just flat and
just<00:03:17.640> get<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.030> parent<00:03:18.480> outline<00:03:18.870> your<00:03:18.989> board<00:03:19.170> on

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
just get a parent outline your board on

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:46.660 
just get a parent outline your board on
the<00:03:21.959> other<00:03:22.049> side<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.290> grip

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.099 

it<00:03:49.370> sort<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.400> cut<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.700> shape<00:03:50.879> of<00:03:51.000> my<00:03:51.180> thing<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
it sort of cut the shape of my thing I

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.809 
it sort of cut the shape of my thing I
always<00:03:52.739> like<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:52.920> make<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.129> bit<00:03:53.250> wider<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:53.640> I

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
always like to make it bit wider so I

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.369 
always like to make it bit wider so I
can<00:03:53.969> come<00:03:54.180> off<00:03:54.349> when<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.439> should<00:03:55.650> put<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:57.379> you

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
can come off when I should put on you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.800 
can come off when I should put on you
know<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:59.280> same<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.700> number<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.420> who's<00:04:00.659> gonna

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
know the same in number one who's gonna

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:39.620 
know the same in number one who's gonna
cover<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.200> whole<00:04:01.409> thing<00:04:37.729> right<00:04:38.729> much<00:04:39.389> than

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
cover this whole thing right much than

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.420 
cover this whole thing right much than
that<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:40.050> not<00:04:40.500> very<00:04:40.650> good<00:04:40.710> because<00:04:40.979> it's<00:04:41.250> not

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
that I'm not very good because it's not

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.370 
that I'm not very good because it's not
that<00:04:41.580> good<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.270> other<00:04:45.330> side<00:04:45.449> but

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
that good that on the other side but

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.860 
that good that on the other side but
it's<00:04:46.710> reasonably<00:04:47.070> good<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:48.210> then<00:04:48.360> when<00:04:48.780> you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
it's reasonably good and then when you

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.060 
it's reasonably good and then when you
want<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.050> setup<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.320> new<00:04:49.409> boy<00:04:49.530> just<00:04:49.710> take<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:49.979> off

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
want to setup a new boy just take it off

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.850 
want to setup a new boy just take it off
and<00:04:50.870> actually<00:04:51.870> yeah<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:51.990> then<00:04:52.229> when<00:04:52.409> flip<00:04:52.710> it

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
and actually yeah and then when flip it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.589 
and actually yeah and then when flip it
on<00:04:53.039> if<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.400> got<00:04:53.550> like<00:04:53.729> deep<00:04:53.970> concave<00:04:54.419> you

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
on if you got like deep concave you

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.930 
on if you got like deep concave you
might<00:04:54.750> actually<00:04:54.960> push<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.380> concave<00:04:55.710> shape

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
might actually push the concave shape

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.640 
might actually push the concave shape
into<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.720> it's<00:04:57.840> got<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> bit<00:04:58.169> more<00:04:58.320> company

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
into this so it's got a bit more company

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.070 
into this so it's got a bit more company
and<00:04:59.190> as<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.370> shape<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.669> cakes<00:04:59.880> cuz<00:05:00.180> then<00:05:00.330> once

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
and as you shape the cakes cuz then once

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.020 
and as you shape the cakes cuz then once
you<00:05:01.169> put<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.349> on<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.650> won't<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:02.010> pick<00:05:02.820> up<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
you put it on it won't like pick up a

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.810 
you put it on it won't like pick up a
mantra<00:05:03.449> for<00:05:03.479> that<00:05:03.840> against<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.409> it<00:05:05.400> it<00:05:05.639> doesn't

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
mantra for that against it it it doesn't

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.210 
mantra for that against it it it doesn't
like<00:05:06.030> bending<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:06.750> if<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:06.990> bend<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.830> enough

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
like bending so if you bend it enough

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.969 
like bending so if you bend it enough
like<00:05:08.780> see<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:14.930> this<00:05:15.930> is<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:16.919> want

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
like see of this this is that you want

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.770 
like see of this this is that you want
to<00:05:17.099> almost<00:05:17.580> like<00:05:17.729> bend<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.090> concave<00:05:18.389> into<00:05:18.659> it

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
to almost like bend the concave into it

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.070 
to almost like bend the concave into it
like<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:19.680> not<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.639> much<00:05:20.820> but<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.330> get

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
like that not that much but you get

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.800 
like that not that much but you get
right<00:05:22.199> here<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.560> then<00:05:22.740> might<00:05:22.889> Bend<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.310> kicks

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
right here and then might Bend the kicks

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.040 
right here and then might Bend the kicks
into<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:24.960> well<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:27.000> when<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.210> goes<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.539> it

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
into it as well so when it goes in it

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.610 
into it as well so when it goes in it
kind<00:05:28.260> of<00:05:28.380> already<00:05:28.830> knows<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.370> shape<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:31.560> your

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
kind of already knows the shape of your

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.230 
kind of already knows the shape of your
board<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:33.900> won't<00:05:34.080> want<00:05:34.199> to<00:05:34.260> go<00:05:34.380> flat<00:05:35.240> okay

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
board so it won't want to go flat okay

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.600 
board so it won't want to go flat okay
that's<00:05:36.479> my<00:05:36.659> way<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.870> making<00:05:37.310> some<00:05:38.310> paper<00:05:38.490> in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
that's my way of making some paper in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.360 
that's my way of making some paper in
don't<00:05:38.789> grip<00:05:39.060> dumping<00:05:39.900> making<00:05:40.620> it<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:40.860> it

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
don't grip dumping making it so it

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.600 
don't grip dumping making it so it
sticks<00:05:41.930> number<00:05:42.930> why<00:05:43.199> why<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.590> way<00:05:43.830> one<00:05:44.070> looks

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
sticks number why why it way one looks

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.580 
sticks number why why it way one looks
good<00:05:44.820> like<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.180> finger<00:05:45.509> Bowl<00:05:45.599> company<00:05:45.990> way<00:05:46.530> too

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
good like a finger Bowl company way too

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.200 
good like a finger Bowl company way too
it's<00:05:46.919> just<00:05:47.479> bit<00:05:48.479> more<00:05:48.659> neat<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:49.080> bit<00:05:49.229> more

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
it's just bit more neat and a bit more

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.510 
it's just bit more neat and a bit more
nicer<00:05:51.210> for<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.449> environment<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.919> that

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
nicer for the environment and that

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.390 
nicer for the environment and that
concludes<00:05:54.300> my

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
concludes my
