in just with the pinch features so that
works<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:49.720> well<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.710> minus<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
works as well as well as the minus and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.130 
works as well as well as the minus and
plus<00:02:51.280> buttons<00:02:51.760> then<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.660> move<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:52.990> and

under you do a triple tap and it will do
a<00:03:27.760> redo<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.510> one<00:03:28.720> two<00:03:28.900> three<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.440> bam<00:03:30.310> its<00:03:30.640> back

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
a redo so one two three and bam its back

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.780 
a redo so one two three and bam its back
so<00:03:31.930> that's<00:03:32.560> time<00:03:32.770> do<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.100> redo<00:03:33.340> there's<00:03:33.610> also

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
so that's time do and redo there's also

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.880 
so that's time do and redo there's also
undo<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.510> redo<00:03:34.570> buttons<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.709> bottom
