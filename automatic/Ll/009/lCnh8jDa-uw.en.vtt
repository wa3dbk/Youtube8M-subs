00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 but people i'll introduce you today 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 canon 100 dvr has now a time 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
 long photographed and also filmed or 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 just my experience with the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 share camera with you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.900
 First, I have to say that's important 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 for the first price scarcely 600 euro costs 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.720
 the one in this kit now that is one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.359
 18 55mm lens on the front was very 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.579
 convincing is more about that right now 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.890
 Generally what falls first of all on yes 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.200
 but this is relatively compact 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.129
 nevertheless still so this typical 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 I like mirror reflex optics now 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.829
 but it is extremely light and that is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.079
 always one of the most important things 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.180
 recognizing de is really that easy 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.530
 So the lightest camera is in the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 segment as I know so far 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 and even the canon eos mda clearly 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.649
 smaller is even heavier than 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 So that really convinces you because it is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.189
 always no huge cameras 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 take the super great pictures 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.130
 but maybe you do not have them with you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.360
 if you had not no lust 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.340
 hauling and how can you really 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.320
 always take it with us is compact is unfinished 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.490
 also has how I am so extremely easy 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 I have the first one as me 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 had not unpacked until the battery is not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 in there but that was already in it and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 Nevertheless, this weight holds that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 Objectively, I have to say that fits 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 wonderful I am not a friend of these 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 long telephoto lenses you need 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 but you really do not see one here 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.970
 we have a relatively short area 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.560
 that means no long search possible 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.150
 but the need in the rules also 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 Do not use these giant tele lenses with you 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.420
 the long zoom because you need one 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.729
 tripod for and so for normal 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.470
 So you can use it with it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.530
 is really enough and the objective 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.880
 makes little great pictures in use 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.220
 so we can take pictures and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.619
 film slide here easy from 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.409
 There can be different here 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.840
 Select modes 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.549
 One thing I think that's great 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.090
 is the miniature effect I'm up here 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.810
 the creative automatically 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.250
 ca and then in the photo mode to come 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.410
 that I have to be a little bit practical 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.050
 I always just press the buttons 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.209
 I can do that now and then if I can 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 on the buttons or the touchscreen is 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 well you can by custom 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 either use touchscreen more or 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.310
 stop the buttons here then I can 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.980
 Here creative filter select the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.840
 miniature effect that's really right 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.360
 Great just is not here, I can now 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 to shift which area of ​​the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.160
 not only want to have sharp picture 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:50.260
 thus the little gets to suffer 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.970
 at and in the area not trained 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.799
 what kind of militia do we have to do that 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.599
 You can also do it more often then 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.670
 also on the menu you can here to the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.879
 lightning just make it clear , of course 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.950
 quite practical otherwise I'm blind 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.299
 Also a few photos what I like 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.650
 I have made exemplary and the 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.560
 miniature effect to make that the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 actually for food for example if 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.750
 Now give me an example of where I am 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.519
 it did 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.799
 that looks really cool like 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.959
 eg also for hotel rooms 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.849
 you can process what maybe 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.500
 not quite as spectacular looks through 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.209
 this miniature effect only the one 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.560
 You can do it in the focus area 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.380
 make it look really great 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120
 for a clever piece of paper I look 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.160
 can give you some examples 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.260
 where I synonymous the hdr effect before the 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.450
 has tried camera out there can 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.739
 we see that is a special hdr 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.959
 backlight function 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.700
 he gets really great photos great 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.760
 Processing where you stop into the light 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.239
 I've photographed times for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.169
 Landscape photography tried out here 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.180
 in southern Italy 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.829
 there you see the colors of really good 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.959
 over and the photos are super like me 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.750
 although it is a relatively small compact 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.370
 Camera is I would have hotels too 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.900
 I can already say you can 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.099
 super participated yes and you know it 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.060
 car five movies and photos with cars me 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.209
 I'll give you a few examples 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.560
 for car photography and I had to 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.720
 I say I do not miss these 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.280
 huge camera i can not see any here now 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.690
 quality differences will be the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.220
 quality does not convince me 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.410
 So I think there is really 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.090
 once the ease of the quality 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.160
 These do not convince the menu 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.940
 could be a bit easier sometimes 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.350
 his 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.480
 that made me even a little bit annoyed 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.970
 but overall I have to say that 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.870
 so weight and quality there really 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.340
 convince what movie concerns 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.260
 we can stop up here too 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.990
 continue switching on this little one 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 movie symbol and then I have to go up here 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.419
 press the button I have a record 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.010
 here and then you can also film 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.470
 i also tried it i can 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.180
 you also have some movie examples 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.070
 we just have cooking 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.050
 Follow with filmed or too 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.240
 Partially a couple of car sequences like 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.430
 sometimes filmed and I have to say so 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.700
 Film also still supermacht too 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.970
 full hd, however, only 25 full frames 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.800
 per second that is the new movie 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.830
 Cameras that I choose the liquid 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.570
 the 150 pictures make the second 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.130
 All in all, I'll tell you if you have the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.260
 Camera really keeps still then you can 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.900
 It also needs a good movie of course 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.970
 watch out 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.490
 Due to the design thus to do so 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.039
 missing or because we are moving fast 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.020
 and so difficult if you do it 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.550
 keeps calm and the things through the picture 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.310
 to go through is also for the film 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.140
 good but if you move the camera then 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.090
 is not objective by this long 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.190
 quite so suitable for it in total 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.810
 I would pull it now as wait 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.270
 really natural as a camera and 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.919
 it really super useful toll on 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.470
 traveling because the road is so easy 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.000
 can take and I think the price 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.220
 is in order 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.630
 yes if you already have experience with the 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.680
 recognize 100 de then did 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.180
 just write in the comments 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.650
 and if you still have any questions 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.090
 then I have to try it too 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.960
 answer and if I do not know 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.560
 just like that is a little bit too 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.990
 conceal 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.800
 to help you there further 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.800
 Thank you for watching
