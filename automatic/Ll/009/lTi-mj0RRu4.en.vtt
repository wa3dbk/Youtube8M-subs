00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
yo guys spider bite here and I know it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.360 
yo guys spider bite here and I know it
did<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.049> update<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> little<00:00:14.040> earlier

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
did that update to a little earlier

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.919 
did that update to a little earlier
today<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:15.120> are<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> few<00:00:15.240> things<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.900> i

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
forgot i know i get long women sometimes

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.420 
forgot i know i get long women sometimes
and<00:00:18.600> i<00:00:18.660> forget<00:00:18.960> what's<00:00:19.230> i<00:00:19.380> need<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> cover<00:00:19.800> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and i forget what's i need to cover so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.420 
and i forget what's i need to cover so
I'm<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:21.119> gonna<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> first

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I'm just gonna to it here so the first

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.670 
I'm just gonna to it here so the first
thing<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> theories<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> had

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
thing is one of the theories that we had

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.880 
thing is one of the theories that we had
a<00:00:25.710> while<00:00:26.130> ago<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:27.019> completing<00:00:28.019> both<00:00:28.320> Easter

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
a while ago about completing both Easter

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.999 
a while ago about completing both Easter
eggs<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> same<00:00:29.580> game<00:00:30.199> because<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
eggs in the same game because the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.229 
eggs in the same game because the
results<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.790> after<00:00:33.630> completing<00:00:34.020> Maxis<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
results of after completing Maxis and

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.580 
results of after completing Maxis and
completing<00:00:36.239> Rick<00:00:36.420> top<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.899> separately<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
completing Rick top and separately is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350 
completing Rick top and separately is
that<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:38.760> lamp<00:00:39.000> posts

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that you have for these lamp posts

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
that you have for these lamp posts
activated<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.170> they're<00:00:40.620> sending<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> beams

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
activated and they're sending the beams

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.840 
activated and they're sending the beams
to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.120> pylon<00:00:42.829> again<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:44.309> thoughts<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to the pylon again my thoughts from the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
to the pylon again my thoughts from the
last<00:00:45.149> video<00:00:45.329> were<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> those<00:00:46.469> beans<00:00:46.829> are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
last video were that those beans are

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
last video were that those beans are
actually<00:00:47.489> powering<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.989> drop<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually powering the drop that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.490 
actually powering the drop that
eventually<00:00:50.309> comes<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.989> middle<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
eventually comes down in the middle the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.090 
eventually comes down in the middle the
center<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.070> pylon<00:00:53.489> area<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.590> guess<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
center of the pylon area and I guess the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
center of the pylon area and I guess the
theory<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.059> spoke<00:00:57.329> before<00:00:57.449> was<00:00:57.870> ok

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
theory was that we spoke before was ok

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.459 
theory was that we spoke before was ok
well<00:00:58.500> let's<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.800> Richthofen<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.989> first<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.289> at

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
well let's do Richthofen in first or at

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
well let's do Richthofen in first or at
Max's<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.039> doesn't<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.760> matter<00:01:03.090> get

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Max's first doesn't really matter get

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.289 
Max's first doesn't really matter get
the<00:01:04.260> four<00:01:04.970> beams<00:01:05.970> connected<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.520> try

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the four beams connected and then try

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
the four beams connected and then try
and<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.900> other<00:01:09.930> easter<00:01:10.590> egg<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.610> know

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and do the other easter egg for you know

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
and do the other easter egg for you know
if<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.880> did<00:01:12.030> max<00:01:12.270> us<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> Richthofen<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
if you did max us then do Richthofen and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.270 
if you did max us then do Richthofen and
perhaps<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.180> other<00:01:15.390> four<00:01:15.900> lamp<00:01:16.770> posts

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
perhaps to get the other four lamp posts

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.460 
perhaps to get the other four lamp posts
to<00:01:17.729> light<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> beams<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.290> then

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to light up with the beams and then

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
to light up with the beams and then
you'd<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:20.009> eight<00:01:20.220> running<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.180> reason

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you'd have all eight running the reason

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.870 
you'd have all eight running the reason
why<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.369> feasible

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
why i don't think that is it's feasible

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
why i don't think that is it's feasible
or<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.540> valid<00:01:25.049> theory<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.729> once

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
or it's a valid theory is because once

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.910 
or it's a valid theory is because once
you<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.509> complete<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> Tower<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> Babel

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you actually complete the Tower of Babel

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.020 
you actually complete the Tower of Babel
it<00:01:29.759> saves<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.390> profile<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.400> order<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.729> us

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it saves your profile so in order for us

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
it saves your profile so in order for us
you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.750> myself<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> hyper<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> Axel

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you know with myself and hyper and Axel

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
you know with myself and hyper and Axel
and<00:01:35.790> Mankiller<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.079> were<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:37.920> way

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and Mankiller if we were the only way

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030 
and Mankiller if we were the only way
now<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.689> actually<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.380> both<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
now that we can actually do both in the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.810 
now that we can actually do both in the
same<00:01:41.220> game<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.869> created<00:01:43.820> separate

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
same game is if we all created separate

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.109 
same game is if we all created separate
profiles<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.140> tried<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> again<00:01:47.119> we

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
profiles and then tried it again we

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
profiles and then tried it again we
can't<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.750> our<00:01:48.780> existing<00:01:49.200> profiles<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
can't do it on our existing profiles and

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.609 
can't do it on our existing profiles and
it's<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.909> not<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.479> entirely<00:01:51.899> related<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it's it's not even entirely related to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
it's it's not even entirely related to
the<00:01:52.740> host<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.399> i<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.759> created<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the host because i actually created a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.469 
the host because i actually created a
new<00:01:54.479> profile<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> i<00:01:55.920> hosted<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> game<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.149> i

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
new profile and i hosted the game and i

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
new profile and i hosted the game and i
got<00:01:57.689> those<00:01:57.899> three<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> once<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.399> went<00:01:59.579> into

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
got those three in and once we went into

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.780 
got those three in and once we went into
the<00:01:59.820> game<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.680> lights<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the game we actually had the lights the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.690 
the game we actually had the lights the
tower<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> pylon<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.200> actually<00:02:04.649> lit<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
tower the pylon was actually lit up so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
tower the pylon was actually lit up so
we'd<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> create<00:02:06.750> separate<00:02:07.020> counsel

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
we'd all have to create separate counsel

bit of sense that you have to do that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
bit of sense that you have to do that

however<00:02:20.130> many<00:02:20.250> counts<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.700> want<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.300> long<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
however many counts I want as long as I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.590 
however many counts I want as long as I
have<00:02:22.050> an<00:02:22.200> email<00:02:22.320> address<00:02:22.620> for<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.420> but<00:02:24.420> for

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
have an email address for it but for

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.630 
have an email address for it but for
Xbox<00:02:25.020> you'd<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.500> pay<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.740> goal<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.580> know

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
Xbox you'd have to pay a goal you know

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.810 
Xbox you'd have to pay a goal you know
live<00:02:27.330> xbox<00:02:27.870> live<00:02:28.260> gold<00:02:28.530> for<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.460> separate

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
live xbox live gold for a separate

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.040 
live xbox live gold for a separate
account<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.600> doesn't<00:02:30.840> make<00:02:30.990> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
account so it really doesn't make a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.410 
account so it really doesn't make a
whole<00:02:31.140> lot<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.380> sense<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:33.240> don't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
whole lot of sense so I really don't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.590 
whole lot of sense so I really don't
think<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.890> correct<00:02:35.100> path<00:02:35.600> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
think that is the correct path the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.360 
think that is the correct path the
second<00:02:37.200> thing<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.530> forgot<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> cover<00:02:38.100> was

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
second thing that I forgot to cover was

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
second thing that I forgot to cover was
actually<00:02:38.730> related<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> tweet<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.870> Jimmy

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
now and a lot of the theories that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.020 
now and a lot of the theories that
popped<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.290> after<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.770> we're<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.910> know

popped up after that we're that you know
we<00:02:51.240> completed<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> tasks<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.830> improper

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
we completed the tasks in the improper

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.400 
we completed the tasks in the improper
order<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:54.209> complete<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.720> Tower<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> Babel

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
order we complete the Tower of Babel

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740 
order we complete the Tower of Babel
perhaps<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.370> know<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.640> completed<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> nav

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
perhaps you know we completed the nav

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.250 
perhaps you know we completed the nav
card<00:02:58.050> table<00:02:58.910> before<00:02:59.930> completing<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> Tower

card table before completing the Tower
of<00:03:01.380> Babel<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:02.070> even<00:03:02.160> need<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.880> nav

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
of Babel you don't even need the nav

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
of Babel you don't even need the nav
card<00:03:03.360> table<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.870> order<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.260> complete<00:03:04.920> the

card table in order to complete the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.420 
card table in order to complete the
Tower<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.700> Babel<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.390> now<00:03:06.570> know<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.680> perhaps

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
Tower of Babel as we now know so perhaps

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
Tower of Babel as we now know so perhaps
we<00:03:08.850> did<00:03:09.060> things<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> wrong<00:03:09.690> order<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.170> as

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
we did things in the wrong order or as

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.729 
we did things in the wrong order or as
we<00:03:11.040> were<00:03:11.190> completing<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> Tower<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.270> Babel<00:03:12.739> we

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
we were completing the Tower of Babel we

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.949 
we were completing the Tower of Babel we
did<00:03:13.980> things<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.459> wrong<00:03:14.610> order<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.780> just

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
did things in the wrong order and I just

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.500 
did things in the wrong order and I just
want<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> say<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.920> also<00:03:17.700> does<00:03:18.030> not<00:03:18.209> make<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
want to say that also does not make a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.380 
want to say that also does not make a
whole<00:03:18.750> lot<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.959> sense<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.410> me<00:03:19.590> number<00:03:20.489> one<00:03:20.760> once

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
whole lot of sense to me number one once

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.570 
whole lot of sense to me number one once
you<00:03:21.600> build<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.110> nav<00:03:22.440> card<00:03:22.800> table<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.400> is

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
you build that nav card table it is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.640 
you build that nav card table it is
saved<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.150> profile<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.900> can't<00:03:25.200> go<00:03:25.440> back

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
saved to your profile you can't go back

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.229 
saved to your profile you can't go back
and<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.220> goes<00:03:26.550> back<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.970> my<00:03:27.090> previous

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
and it just goes back to my previous

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.330 
and it just goes back to my previous
argument<00:03:28.019> about<00:03:28.290> having<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.920> create<00:03:29.250> an

argument about having to create an

entirely new profile to do things in a

entirely new profile to do things in a
different<00:03:31.560> order<00:03:31.950> once<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.150> table

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
different order once you have the table

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.960 
different order once you have the table
it's<00:03:33.870> done<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.100> mean<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.730> know

for us since day one we all did it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.780 
for us since day one we all did it
together<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.290> four<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.560> us<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.489> always

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.600 
playing solo or we're playing co-op it
doesn't<00:03:51.450> matter<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.200> we<00:03:52.380> can't<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:53.040> we<00:03:53.340> can't

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
doesn't matter so we can't do we can't

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.759 
doesn't matter so we can't do we can't
perform<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.420> different<00:03:54.780> order<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
perform it in a different order and the

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.410 
perform it in a different order and the
same<00:03:55.950> thing<00:03:56.010> goes<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:57.090> know<00:03:57.180> actually

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
same thing goes with you know actually

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.449 
same thing goes with you know actually
completing<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.230> Tower<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.530> Babel<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.980> really

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
completing the Tower of Babel it really

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.390 
completing the Tower of Babel it really
really<00:03:59.970> does<00:04:00.360> not<00:04:00.600> make<00:04:00.930> sense<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.410> me<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.890> mean

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
really does not make sense to me I mean

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.509 
really does not make sense to me I mean
you<00:04:02.790> actually<00:04:03.090> get<00:04:03.630> completion<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.560> get<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
you actually get completion you get you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.190 
you actually get completion you get you
know<00:04:05.610> when<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.000> Rick<00:04:06.180> top<00:04:06.390> inside<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.989> get

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
know when you do Rick top inside you get

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.650 
know when you do Rick top inside you get
him<00:04:07.380> hey<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.040> know<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.790> save<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.239> world<00:04:09.420> or

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
him hey you know you save the world or

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.930 
him hey you know you save the world or
the<00:04:09.780> flesh<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.410> can<00:04:10.560> destroy<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.100> now<00:04:11.160> right

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the flesh and I can destroy it now right

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.970 
the flesh and I can destroy it now right
that's<00:04:12.239> completion<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.620> doesn't<00:04:13.920> necessarily

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
that's completion it doesn't necessarily

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.250 
that's completion it doesn't necessarily
mean<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.030> we've<00:04:15.390> completed<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.019> out<00:04:16.109> of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
mean that we've completed it out of

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.330 
mean that we've completed it out of
order<00:04:16.590> or<00:04:16.620> there's<00:04:16.950> a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
order or there's a

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.920 
order or there's a
in<00:04:17.400> order<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.760> do<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.600> you're<00:04:18.690> going<00:04:18.810> to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
in order to do it and you're going to

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.420 
in order to do it and you're going to
get<00:04:19.019> an<00:04:19.139> entirely<00:04:19.470> different<00:04:19.949> result<00:04:20.250> that

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
get an entirely different result that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.610 
get an entirely different result that
really<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.570> doesn't<00:04:22.019> make<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.199> whole<00:04:22.290> lot<00:04:22.440> of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
really just doesn't make a whole lot of

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.530 
really just doesn't make a whole lot of
sense<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:24.540> again<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.199> know<00:04:25.320> i<00:04:26.389> love<00:04:27.389> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
sense so again you know i love the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.780 
sense so again you know i love the
theories<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.139> i'll<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.650> down<00:04:28.830> those<00:04:29.130> paths<00:04:29.370> in

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
theories and i'll go down those paths in

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.060 
theories and i'll go down those paths in
those<00:04:29.970> roadways<00:04:30.210> but<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.710> at<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> same

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
those roadways but you know at the same

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.790 
those roadways but you know at the same
time<00:04:32.340> i<00:04:32.610> gotta<00:04:32.820> look<00:04:33.000> at<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:34.290> know<00:04:34.350> i<00:04:34.560> only

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
time i gotta look at you know i only

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.560 
time i gotta look at you know i only
have<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.070> much<00:04:35.190> time<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.699> day<00:04:35.880> right<00:04:36.180> I

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
have so much time in the day right I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.120 
have so much time in the day right I
mean<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.960> gotta<00:04:37.169> look<00:04:37.290> at<00:04:37.440> things<00:04:37.680> okay<00:04:37.979> does

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
mean I gotta look at things okay does

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.800 
mean I gotta look at things okay does
this<00:04:38.160> really<00:04:38.639> make<00:04:39.030> sense<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.510> really

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
this really make sense if you really

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.780 
this really make sense if you really
think<00:04:39.990> about<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.350> does<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.280> really<00:04:41.460> make<00:04:41.729> sense

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
think about it does it really make sense

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.390 
think about it does it really make sense
that<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:43.199> order<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.740> do<00:04:43.919> something

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that in order to do something

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.219 
that in order to do something
differently<00:04:44.850> or<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> way<00:04:45.300> its<00:04:45.479> proposed<00:04:45.930> that

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
differently or the way its proposed that

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.110 
differently or the way its proposed that
you<00:04:46.380> have<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.740> create<00:04:46.949> an<00:04:47.100> entirely<00:04:47.400> separate

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
you have to create an entirely separate

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.080 
you have to create an entirely separate
profile<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.919> really<00:04:50.340> does<00:04:50.639> not<00:04:50.850> make

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
profile and that really does not make

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.540 
profile and that really does not make
sense<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.540> me<00:04:51.570> same<00:04:52.110> with<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:53.010> know<00:04:53.100> like

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
sense to me same with the you know like

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.280 
sense to me same with the you know like
in<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.850> last<00:04:54.060> video<00:04:54.240> where<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.570> was<00:04:54.750> refuting

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
in the last video where I was refuting

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.520 
in the last video where I was refuting
the<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.760> light<00:04:57.360> beams<00:04:57.630> coming<00:04:58.169> from<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
the the light beams coming from the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.000 
the the light beams coming from the
laundromat<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:59.190> not<00:04:59.370> repeatable<00:05:00.000> on<00:05:00.380> ps3<00:05:01.380> as

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
laundromat it's not repeatable on ps3 as

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.440 
laundromat it's not repeatable on ps3 as
simple<00:05:02.490> as<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.850> if<00:05:03.240> it's<00:05:03.389> not

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
simple as that and if it's not

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.170 
simple as that and if it's not
repeatable<00:05:03.990> on<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.320> specific<00:05:04.650> console<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.669> just

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
repeatable on a specific console it just

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.879 
repeatable on a specific console it just
doesn't<00:05:06.630> make<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.840> whole<00:05:06.960> lot<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.260> sense<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.680> me

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.800 
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
and<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.850> know<00:05:08.910> it's<00:05:09.300> like<00:05:09.510> I've<00:05:09.690> been

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
and you know it's like I've been

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.690 
and you know it's like I've been
spinning<00:05:10.139> my<00:05:10.350> wheels<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:11.280> know<00:05:11.370> not<00:05:11.669> only

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
spinning my wheels you know not only

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.750 
spinning my wheels you know not only
with<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.650> commitment<00:05:14.100> thing<00:05:14.280> but

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
with the the the commitment thing but

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.969 
with the the the commitment thing but
also<00:05:14.910> with<00:05:15.270> these<00:05:15.479> lights<00:05:15.810> at<00:05:16.139> at<00:05:16.590> the

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
also with these lights at at the

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.890 
also with these lights at at the
laundromat<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.850> you<00:05:18.240> know<00:05:18.330> I'm<00:05:18.479> done<00:05:18.720> with

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
laundromat and you know I'm done with

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.320 
laundromat and you know I'm done with
those<00:05:19.110> unless<00:05:19.470> it<00:05:19.710> can<00:05:19.770> be<00:05:19.889> proven<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:21.090> it's

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
those unless it can be proven that it's

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.360 
those unless it can be proven that it's
consistent<00:05:21.750> on<00:05:22.289> no<00:05:22.740> matter<00:05:22.889> what<00:05:23.160> platform

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
consistent on no matter what platform

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.480 
consistent on no matter what platform
you're<00:05:23.760> playing<00:05:24.030> on<00:05:24.210> then<00:05:24.539> it's<00:05:25.169> in<00:05:26.010> my<00:05:26.070> mind

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
you're playing on then it's in my mind

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.879 
you're playing on then it's in my mind
it's<00:05:26.789> garbage<00:05:27.450> it's<00:05:27.930> useless<00:05:28.260> is<00:05:28.560> pointless

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
it's garbage it's useless is pointless

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.800 
it's garbage it's useless is pointless
but<00:05:29.669> anyways<00:05:30.120> those<00:05:30.360> are<00:05:30.389> just<00:05:30.600> my<00:05:30.690> thoughts

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
but anyways those are just my thoughts

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.379 
but anyways those are just my thoughts
and<00:05:31.229> mine<00:05:31.650> alone<00:05:31.950> unless<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:32.940> share<00:05:33.180> them

and mine alone unless you share them

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.830
