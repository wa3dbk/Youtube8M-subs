it was this beautiful kelp forest with

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.040 
it was this beautiful kelp forest with
what<00:00:15.250> I<00:00:15.280> call<00:00:15.550> the<00:00:15.760> cathedral<00:00:16.480> effect<00:00:16.840> with

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
what I call the cathedral effect with

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.050 
what I call the cathedral effect with
the<00:00:17.170> sunlight<00:00:17.590> streaming<00:00:18.279> down<00:00:18.640> through<00:00:18.939> the

canopy of giant kelp you really felt

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.010 
canopy of giant kelp you really felt
like<00:00:21.340> you<00:00:21.460> were<00:00:21.670> just<00:00:21.700> flying<00:00:22.240> through<00:00:22.810> the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
like you were just flying through the

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.960 
like you were just flying through the
forest<00:00:23.680> when<00:00:24.070> you're<00:00:24.220> looking<00:00:24.520> up<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:24.880> you're

forest when you're looking up and you're

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.030 
forest when you're looking up and you're
just<00:00:25.150> seeing<00:00:25.360> just<00:00:25.720> these<00:00:26.080> rays<00:00:26.349> light<00:00:26.710> coming

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
through the celts just so calm and

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.689 
through the celts just so calm and
peaceful<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:29.380> that's<00:00:29.560> that's<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.490> bliss

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
peaceful and that's that's the bliss

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.070 
peaceful and that's that's the bliss
that<00:00:30.880> you<00:00:30.970> get<00:00:31.150> from<00:00:31.330> scuba<00:00:31.840> diving<00:00:32.169> here

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.970 

the<00:00:35.710> reef<00:00:35.860> check<00:00:36.070> foundation<00:00:36.550> was<00:00:36.700> founded<00:00:37.150> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the reef check foundation was founded in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390 
the reef check foundation was founded in
1996<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.480> 2005<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:41.500> started<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.920> California

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
1996 in 2005 we started the California

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.030 
1996 in 2005 we started the California
program<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:43.090> collect<00:00:43.720> scientific<00:00:43.930> data<00:00:44.290> with

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
program to collect scientific data with

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.190 
program to collect scientific data with
citizen<00:00:45.550> scientists<00:00:46.180> so<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.720> state<00:00:46.930> can

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
citizen scientists so that the state can

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.560 
citizen scientists so that the state can
make<00:00:47.230> informed<00:00:47.710> decisions<00:00:48.250> about<00:00:48.570> protecting

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
make informed decisions about protecting

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.440 
make informed decisions about protecting
our<00:00:49.660> oceans<00:00:49.990> I<00:00:50.260> was<00:00:51.100> drawn<00:00:51.400> to<00:00:51.430> it<00:00:51.820> because<00:00:52.420> of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
our oceans I was drawn to it because of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.960 
our oceans I was drawn to it because of
the<00:00:52.800> scientific<00:00:53.800> methodology<00:00:54.670> the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
the scientific methodology the

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.090 
the scientific methodology the
structured<00:00:55.570> approach<00:00:56.290> they're<00:00:56.560> taking<00:00:56.950> to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
structured approach they're taking to

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.360 
structured approach they're taking to
gathering<00:00:57.580> data<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.720> think<00:00:58.960> that<00:00:59.370> makes

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
gathering data and I think that makes

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.500 
gathering data and I think that makes
them<00:01:00.640> stand<00:01:00.940> out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
them stand out

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.820 
them stand out
marine<00:01:01.840> biology<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.320> sort<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.590> hard<00:01:02.800> thing

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
marine biology is sort of a hard thing

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.430 
marine biology is sort of a hard thing
to<00:01:03.010> make<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.430> into<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.790> career<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.410> a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
to make it into a career and this is a

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.590 
to make it into a career and this is a
great<00:01:05.740> way<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.920> be<00:01:06.730> part<00:01:06.970> of<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.479> get

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
great way to be part of it you get

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360 
great way to be part of it you get
people<00:01:07.720> with<00:01:07.960> different<00:01:08.410> missions<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:09.040> the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
people with different missions and the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.650 
people with different missions and the
way<00:01:09.460> they<00:01:09.610> use<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> ocean<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.240> different<00:01:10.510> ways

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
way they use the ocean in different ways

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.600 
way they use the ocean in different ways
but<00:01:11.200> everyone<00:01:11.740> just<00:01:11.770> cares<00:01:12.160> about<00:01:12.250> getting

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
but everyone just cares about getting

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
but everyone just cares about getting
good<00:01:12.729> data<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:13.150> had<00:01:13.300> done<00:01:13.450> enough<00:01:13.479> scuba<00:01:13.990> diving

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
good data I had done enough scuba diving

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.260 
good data I had done enough scuba diving
where<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.560> was<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.130> getting<00:01:15.700> more<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.150> more

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
where I was really getting more and more

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.030 
where I was really getting more and more
curious<00:01:16.420> about<00:01:16.660> what<00:01:16.900> I<00:01:16.930> was<00:01:17.080> seeing<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.710> so<00:01:18.010> I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
curious about what I was seeing and so I

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.410 
curious about what I was seeing and so I
thought<00:01:18.280> hey<00:01:18.400> this<00:01:18.550> is<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.700> perfect<00:01:19.119> way<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.210> do

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
thought hey this is a perfect way to do

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.540 
thought hey this is a perfect way to do
that<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.990> opportunity<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.680> dive<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.250> have

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
that the opportunity to dive we have

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.240 
that the opportunity to dive we have
some<00:01:21.850> specific<00:01:22.390> tasks<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:22.960> undertake<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.740> an

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
some specific tasks to undertake is an

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.859 
some specific tasks to undertake is an
entirely<00:01:24.550> different<00:01:24.729> experience<00:01:25.570> when<00:01:25.750> you

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
entirely different experience when you

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.090 
entirely different experience when you
have<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.140> think<00:01:26.410> critically<00:01:26.560> about<00:01:26.830> what

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
have to think critically about what

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.320 
have to think critically about what
you're<00:01:27.220> looking<00:01:27.520> at<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.850> take<00:01:28.090> note<00:01:28.300> of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
you're looking at and take note of

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.420 
you're looking at and take note of
things<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:29.070> otherwise<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.280> would<00:01:30.400> have

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
things that otherwise you would have

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.340 
things that otherwise you would have
just<00:01:30.640> passed<00:01:30.820> on<00:01:31.000> by<00:01:31.180> formal<00:01:31.900> very<00:01:32.050> special

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
just passed on by formal very special

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.200 
just passed on by formal very special
relationship<00:01:32.860> with<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.400> environment<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.000> I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
relationship with the environment and I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.380 
relationship with the environment and I
love<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.520> usually<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> pretty

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
love that we usually have a pretty

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.600 
love that we usually have a pretty
rigorous<00:01:37.690> dive<00:01:38.080> briefing<00:01:38.350> where<00:01:38.800> we<00:01:38.979> go<00:01:39.250> over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
rigorous dive briefing where we go over

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.180 
rigorous dive briefing where we go over
the<00:01:39.960> scientific<00:01:40.960> methods<00:01:41.320> again<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.890> kind<00:01:42.130> of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
the scientific methods again we kind of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.859 
the scientific methods again we kind of
go<00:01:42.340> through<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.580> species<00:01:43.060> lists<00:01:43.450> remind

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
go through the species lists remind

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.810 
go through the species lists remind
people<00:01:44.080> of<00:01:44.410> what<00:01:44.470> we<00:01:44.740> need<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.070> look<00:01:45.190> for<00:01:45.460> fish

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
people of what we need to look for fish

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.260 
algae and then the substrate we survey
along<00:01:50.679> what's<00:01:50.890> called<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.130> transect<00:01:51.640> when<00:01:51.940> we

coming<00:02:00.250> behind<00:02:00.700> us

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
coming behind us

you<00:02:02.979> can<00:02:03.220> wind<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.060> tape<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.450> then<00:02:04.569> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
you can wind up the tape and then the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.210 
you can wind up the tape and then the
dive<00:02:04.929> before<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.470> run<00:02:05.619> out<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.800> air

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220

the<00:02:11.220> only<00:02:11.370> requirement<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the only requirement that we have is

that you're an experienced scuba diver

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.460 
that you're an experienced scuba diver
and<00:02:14.310> then<00:02:14.640> we'll<00:02:14.940> chain<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.690> doing<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.319> two

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and then we'll chain you doing a two

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then we'll chain you doing a two
weekend<00:02:16.770> long<00:02:16.920> training<00:02:17.220> how<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> identify

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
weekend long training how to identify

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440 
weekend long training how to identify
and<00:02:19.020> count<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.860> indicator<00:02:20.550> species<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.300> we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and count the indicator species that we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.850 
and count the indicator species that we
monitor<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.870> California's<00:02:22.349> rates<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
monitor on California's rates the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.470 
monitor on California's rates the
practical<00:02:23.430> training<00:02:23.610> we<00:02:23.880> actually<00:02:24.209> went<00:02:24.390> in

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
practical training we actually went in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.150 
practical training we actually went in
the<00:02:24.540> ocean<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:25.140> valuable<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> me<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the ocean was valuable to me because I

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.270 
the ocean was valuable to me because I
realized<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.030> seeing<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.110> picture<00:02:29.040> of

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
realized that just seeing the picture of

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
realized that just seeing the picture of
something<00:02:29.580> doesn't<00:02:30.450> really<00:02:30.600> convey<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
something doesn't really convey to you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.059 
something doesn't really convey to you
how<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.510> organism<00:02:33.530> actually<00:02:34.530> looks<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
how that organism actually looks and

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.800 
how that organism actually looks and
behaves<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> water<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:38.390> think<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.599> hardest

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
behaves in the water I think the hardest

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.270 
behaves in the water I think the hardest
part<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.260> training<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.980> once<00:02:41.160> you've

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
part is the training and once you've

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
part is the training and once you've
done<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.330> smooth<00:02:42.870> sailing<00:02:43.080> it's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
done that it's just smooth sailing it's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.890 
done that it's just smooth sailing it's
