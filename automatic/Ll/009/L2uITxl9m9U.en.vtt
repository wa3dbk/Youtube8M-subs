and he was showing me some plans that he

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.780 
and he was showing me some plans that he
had<00:00:06.810> drawn<00:00:07.049> up<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> doll<00:00:07.890> stroller<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.670> his

granddaughter and we got onto the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.760 
granddaughter and we got onto the
subject<00:00:11.760> of<00:00:12.150> why<00:00:12.720> couldn't<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.350> make<00:00:13.590> your

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
subject of why couldn't you make your

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.210 
subject of why couldn't you make your
own<00:00:13.800> wheels<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:15.139> he<00:00:16.139> had<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.439> idea<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
own wheels and he had an idea for the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
own wheels and he had an idea for the
tire<00:00:17.490> now<00:00:17.850> I'd<00:00:18.060> never<00:00:18.269> thought<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.749> this<00:00:18.869> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
tire now I'd never thought of this but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
tire now I'd never thought of this but
this<00:00:19.499> is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.679> super<00:00:20.189> idea<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.999> a<00:00:21.029> tire<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this is a super idea for a tire for a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.140 
this is a super idea for a tire for a
wooden<00:00:22.230> wheel<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> try<00:00:24.089> it

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
wooden wheel so I'm going to try it

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.620 
wooden wheel so I'm going to try it
myself<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:25.349> we<00:00:25.529> go<00:00:26.089> now<00:00:27.089> what<00:00:27.240> you're<00:00:27.449> seeing

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
myself here we go now what you're seeing

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.229 
myself here we go now what you're seeing
me<00:00:27.869> making<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.499> is<00:00:28.679> not<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.220> wheel<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.029> is

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
me making here is not the wheel this is

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.300 
me making here is not the wheel this is
going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.720> two<00:00:31.409> different<00:00:31.560> things<00:00:31.829> first

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
going to be two different things first

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.160 
going to be two different things first
of<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> tenon<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of all it's going to be the tenon that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
of all it's going to be the tenon that
the<00:00:34.350> jaws<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.039> Chuck<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> be

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the jaws of the Chuck are going to be

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
the jaws of the Chuck are going to be
able<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.210> grab<00:00:36.899> onto<00:00:37.170> when<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
able to grab onto when I put it in the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.720 
able to grab onto when I put it in the
lathe<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.320> second<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> ball<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> turn<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lathe and second the ball when I turn it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.310 
lathe and second the ball when I turn it
around<00:00:41.789> I'm<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> turn<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> down<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
around I'm going to turn it down so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.060 
around I'm going to turn it down so
it'll<00:00:43.469> sort<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.039> a<00:00:44.100> hubcap<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:46.710> glue

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it'll sort of be like a hubcap this glue

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490 
it'll sort of be like a hubcap this glue
up<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.609> see<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.629> these<00:00:49.170> are

now on the other hand this belt that I

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.740 
now on the other hand this belt that I
just<00:01:56.950> recently<00:01:57.190> put<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:57.700> my<00:01:57.970> edge<00:01:58.150> sander<00:01:58.390> knew

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
just recently put on my edge sander knew

was<00:01:59.620> almost<00:02:00.460> ten<00:02:00.730> dollars<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.360> I'm<00:02:01.960> not<00:02:02.140> about

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
was almost ten dollars and I'm not about

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.440 
was almost ten dollars and I'm not about
to<00:02:02.440> load<00:02:02.740> it<00:02:02.920> up<00:02:03.040> with<00:02:03.070> glue<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:04.030> that's<00:02:04.240> why<00:02:04.390> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
to load it up with glue so that's why I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.810 
to load it up with glue so that's why I
use<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.840> old<00:02:04.990> belt<00:02:05.260> first<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:06.220> system<00:02:06.580> works

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
use the old belt first this system works

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.210

pretty<00:02:07.000> good

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.310 

okay<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.490> belt<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.970> whizzing<00:02:16.420> by<00:02:16.570> at<00:02:16.780> over<00:02:17.050> 30

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
okay this belt is whizzing by at over 30

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320 
okay this belt is whizzing by at over 30
mile<00:02:17.560> an<00:02:17.590> hour<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> sure<00:02:18.610> don't<00:02:18.820> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> put

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
mile an hour so I sure don't want to put

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.710 
mile an hour so I sure don't want to put
very<00:02:19.480> much<00:02:19.600> pressure<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.320> here

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.120 

now<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.780> would<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.350> this<00:02:24.620> bit<00:02:24.890> would

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
now you would think that this bit would

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.100 
now you would think that this bit would
be<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> standard<00:02:25.640> quarter-inch<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.840> most

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
be a standard quarter-inch like most

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280 
be a standard quarter-inch like most
other<00:02:27.410> hole<00:02:28.370> saws<00:02:28.730> are<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:29.540> not<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.080> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
other hole saws are but it's not it's a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.949 
other hole saws are but it's not it's a
64th<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.130> an<00:02:31.280> inch<00:02:31.490> under<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.420> naturally<00:02:32.930> I

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
64th of an inch under so naturally I

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.390 
64th of an inch under so naturally I
want<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.319> hole<00:02:33.500> that's<00:02:33.680> going<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
want the hole that's going to be in the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.610 
want the hole that's going to be in the
wood<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.120> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.480> be<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.690> wheel<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.470> be

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
wood it's going to be the wheel to be

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.980 
wood it's going to be the wheel to be
the<00:02:36.770> same<00:02:36.980> size<00:02:37.300> make<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> lot<00:02:38.630> easier<00:02:38.660> to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
the same size make it a lot easier to

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.240 
the same size make it a lot easier to
align<00:02:39.470> everything<00:02:41.440> okay<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.740> speed<00:02:43.040> up

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
align everything okay I got a speed up

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.160 
align everything okay I got a speed up
the<00:02:43.370> drill<00:02:43.610> press<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.240> was<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.690> low<00:02:44.870> gear

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the drill press here it was in low gear

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.360 
the drill press here it was in low gear
for<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.500> hole<00:02:45.860> saw

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
for that hole saw

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.360 
for that hole saw
now<00:02:46.610> we'll<00:02:46.760> get<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.030> back<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.360> normal

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.780 

you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.089 

I<00:02:59.849> know<00:03:00.659> this<00:03:00.959> three-quarter<00:03:01.560> inch<00:03:01.709> blade<00:03:01.950> is

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
I know this three-quarter inch blade is

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.770 
I know this three-quarter inch blade is
way<00:03:02.340> too<00:03:02.400> wide<00:03:02.760> for<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.480> have

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
way too wide for this and I do have

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.330 
way too wide for this and I do have
others<00:03:04.079> but<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.409> takes<00:03:04.620> about<00:03:04.769> half<00:03:04.950> an<00:03:05.219> hour

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
others but it takes about half an hour

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.940 
others but it takes about half an hour
to<00:03:05.549> change<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> I'll<00:03:07.049> just<00:03:07.260> nibble<00:03:07.590> away<00:03:07.709> at

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
to change so I'll just nibble away at

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.559 
to change so I'll just nibble away at
this<00:03:08.129> I'm<00:03:08.549> going<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.849> be<00:03:08.939> using<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> dis

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
this I'm going to be using the dis

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.149 
this I'm going to be using the dis
sander<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.140> take<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.500> down<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.950> line

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
sander to take it down to the line

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:23.480 
sander to take it down to the line
anyway

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.460 

you

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:40.110 

you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.750 

I<00:03:43.409> left<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.560> drill<00:03:44.799> bit<00:03:44.980> stuck<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.459> there<00:03:45.610> for

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
I left the drill bit stuck in there for

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.670 
I left the drill bit stuck in there for
two<00:03:45.909> or<00:03:45.940> three<00:03:46.239> minutes<00:03:46.540> long<00:03:47.049> enough<00:03:47.349> for<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
two or three minutes long enough for the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.750 
two or three minutes long enough for the
two<00:03:48.010> pieces<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.580> stop<00:03:48.819> sliding<00:03:49.150> around<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:50.760> knew

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
two pieces to stop sliding around I knew

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.580 
two pieces to stop sliding around I knew
that<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.180> glue<00:03:52.480> couldn't<00:03:52.870> possibly<00:03:53.349> be<00:03:53.560> any

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
that that glue couldn't possibly be any

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.740 
that that glue couldn't possibly be any
good<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.310> drill<00:03:54.580> bit<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.239> after<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.569> go

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
good for that drill bit so after I go

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.720 
good for that drill bit so after I go
through<00:03:55.780> cleaning<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.470> glue<00:03:56.709> off<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.159> soaked

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
through cleaning the glue off I soaked

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.910 
through cleaning the glue off I soaked
it<00:03:57.849> good<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.239> wd-40<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.200> stop<00:03:59.769> any<00:04:00.069> corrosion

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
it good with wd-40 to stop any corrosion

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.020 
it good with wd-40 to stop any corrosion
those<00:04:02.920> clamps<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.400> going<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.610> stay<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.790> there

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
those clamps are going to stay on there

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.210 
those clamps are going to stay on there
for<00:04:04.060> about<00:04:04.329> 12<00:04:04.599> hours<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.140> then<00:04:05.709> after<00:04:06.069> that

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
for about 12 hours and then after that

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.890 
for about 12 hours and then after that
I'll<00:04:06.430> wait<00:04:06.610> maybe<00:04:06.849> three<00:04:07.120> or<00:04:07.150> four<00:04:07.269> hours<00:04:07.690> more

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
I'll wait maybe three or four hours more

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.839 
I'll wait maybe three or four hours more
before<00:04:07.959> I<00:04:08.349> actually<00:04:08.650> put<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.220> pieces<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
before I actually put the pieces in the

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.049 
before I actually put the pieces in the
lathe<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.269> try<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.540> turn<00:04:10.810> them<00:04:10.989> down
