Bane<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.040> there's<00:01:07.640> possibility<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
Bane and there's possibility that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.090 
Bane and there's possibility that
somebody<00:01:08.630> else<00:01:08.930> might<00:01:09.140> also<00:01:09.350> be<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.770> movie

somebody else might also be in the movie
now<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:12.409> i'm<00:01:12.560> hoping<00:01:12.830> i<00:01:12.920> can<00:01:12.980> get<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.250> head

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.540 
on maybe I should start someplace else
the<00:01:17.170> if<00:01:18.170> they<00:01:18.409> knew<00:01:18.620> bein<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.100> way<00:01:19.220> he<00:01:19.430> was

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
the if they knew bein the way he was

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.550 
the if they knew bein the way he was
originally<00:01:19.850> presented<00:01:20.570> where<00:01:21.170> he<00:01:21.380> was<00:01:21.530> a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
originally presented where he was a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.380 
originally presented where he was a
tactician<00:01:22.189> or<00:01:22.610> even<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.939> way<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.240> they've

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
tactician or even the way that they've

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.760 
tactician or even the way that they've
been<00:01:23.420> writing<00:01:23.899> him<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.170> lately<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
been writing him now lately in the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.850 
been writing him now lately in the
secret<00:01:25.220> six<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.960> think<00:01:26.960> we<00:01:27.110> could<00:01:27.259> really<00:01:27.320> have

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
secret six I think we could really have

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.660 
secret six I think we could really have
a<00:01:27.890> very<00:01:28.310> very<00:01:28.549> good<00:01:28.820> movie<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.420> think<00:01:30.229> that<00:01:30.670> vein

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
a very very good movie I think that vein

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.539 
a very very good movie I think that vein
is<00:01:32.090> actually<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.689> worthy<00:01:33.140> character<00:01:33.680> there's

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
is actually a worthy character there's

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.270 
is actually a worthy character there's
also<00:01:34.759> some<00:01:35.060> talk<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.270> Talia<00:01:35.930> being<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.530> as

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
also some talk of Talia being in it as

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.780 
also some talk of Talia being in it as
well<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:39.049> would<00:01:39.229> be<00:01:39.259> kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.619> cool<00:01:39.680> just<00:01:40.640> as

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
well that would be kind of cool just as

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.490 
well that would be kind of cool just as
long<00:01:40.820> as<00:01:40.969> we<00:01:41.210> don't<00:01:41.390> do<00:01:41.630> like<00:01:41.810> lead<00:01:42.020> unlike

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
long as we don't do like lead unlike

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.959 
long as we don't do like lead unlike
some<00:01:42.770> movies<00:01:43.040> have<00:01:43.189> done<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.490> past<00:01:43.670> where

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
some movies have done in the past where

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.760 
some movies have done in the past where
it<00:01:44.000> just<00:01:44.180> gets<00:01:44.360> over<00:01:44.630> done<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.710> being

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
it just gets over done but this being

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.499 
it just gets over done but this being
his<00:01:46.070> last<00:01:46.130> movie<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.909> how<00:01:47.000> well<00:01:47.210> he's<00:01:47.360> done
