00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
exactly as you can see i'm playing on my

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960 
exactly as you can see i'm playing on my
ps3<00:00:19.500> which<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.980> why<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
ps3 which is why it's got a kind of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.859 
ps3 which is why it's got a kind of
window<00:00:21.270> defect<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:23.210> basically<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.480> idea<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
window defect and basically the idea is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.820 
window defect and basically the idea is
the<00:00:25.439> majority<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> game<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:27.170> 2d<00:00:28.170> but

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the majority of the game is in 2d but

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.740 
the majority of the game is in 2d but
levels<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.670> mean<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> graphics<00:00:30.630> are

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
levels of this I mean the graphics are

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.020 
levels of this I mean the graphics are
kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> 3d<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.700> most<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
kind of 3d but most of it is a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
kind of 3d but most of it is a
horizontal<00:00:33.690> movement<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> mean

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
horizontal movement if you know I mean

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.270 
horizontal movement if you know I mean
and<00:00:35.899> there<00:00:36.899> are<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.170> 3d<00:00:37.469> levels<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.860> course<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and there are some 3d levels of course I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
and there are some 3d levels of course I
was<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> couple<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.780> different

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
was going to get a couple of different

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590 
was going to get a couple of different
level<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> show<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.360> took<00:00:42.480> me

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
level to show you but this one took me

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740 
level to show you but this one took me
so<00:00:42.780> long<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.680> share<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so long because I'm share this so I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
so long because I'm share this so I
thought<00:00:45.899> I'd<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.780> really

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
thought I'd just do this one and really

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.310 
thought I'd just do this one and really
this<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> best<00:00:51.780> example

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this this is you know the best example

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
this this is you know the best example
of<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.530> platformer<00:00:53.070> ever<00:00:53.460> made<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.329> my

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
of a platformer ever made it in my

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.900 
of a platformer ever made it in my
opinion<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.960> mean<00:00:55.520> there<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.640> loads<00:00:56.820> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
opinion I mean there are loads of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.279 
opinion I mean there are loads of
platform<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.329> alive<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> be

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
platform was alive but this has to be

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.240 
platform was alive but this has to be
the<00:00:58.320> absolute<00:00:58.530> classic<00:01:00.710> see<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.890> jump<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the absolute classic see you jump on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.880 
the absolute classic see you jump on
enemies<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.879> spin<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.329> away<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.680> some

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
enemies you spin them away here do some

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 
enemies you spin them away here do some
damage<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.659> idea<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.290> through

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
damage and the idea is you get through

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.550 
damage and the idea is you get through
the<00:01:07.590> level<00:01:07.920> each<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> levels<00:01:09.560> collecting

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the level each of the levels collecting

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
the level each of the levels collecting
as<00:01:10.680> many<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:10.979> boxes<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
as many of these boxes as you can and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.950 
as many of these boxes as you can and
without<00:01:12.810> dying<00:01:13.560> too<00:01:13.830> many<00:01:13.979> times<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> get

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
without dying too many times if you get

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.969 
without dying too many times if you get
all<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> boxes<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:18.799> gem<00:01:19.799> or

this this isn't live commentary by the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
this this isn't live commentary by the
way<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.520> frustrated<00:01:29.549> watching

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
way I just get frustrated watching

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
way I just get frustrated watching
myself<00:01:30.450> dying<00:01:32.540> but<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:34.560> course<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
myself dying but of course there was a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
myself dying but of course there was a
kind<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> rivalry<00:01:36.210> between<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> Spyro

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
kind of a rivalry between this and Spyro

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
kind of a rivalry between this and Spyro
the<00:01:37.650> Dragon<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:38.220> were<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.579> rival

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the Dragon there were two rival

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.080 
the Dragon there were two rival
companies<00:01:38.939> competing<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> same<00:01:40.049> time<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
companies competing at the same time and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
companies competing at the same time and
honestly<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.170> both<00:01:43.200> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
honestly I I like them both for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
honestly I I like them both for
different<00:01:43.770> reasons<00:01:44.250> spira<00:01:45.180> has<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.659> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
different reasons spira has more of a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.520 
different reasons spira has more of a
storyline<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:47.270> less<00:01:48.270> linear<00:01:48.689> but

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
storyline there's more less linear but

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.889 
storyline there's more less linear but
this<00:01:50.340> has<00:01:50.610> solid<00:01:51.030> platform<00:01:51.420> where<00:01:51.720> elements

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
this has solid platform where elements

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.630 
this has solid platform where elements
to<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:53.310> them<00:01:53.460> both<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:55.369> basically

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.440

if I ever die the stress raid heart
attack<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.959> will<00:02:55.080> probably<00:02:55.440> be<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
attack it will probably be because of

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.860 
attack it will probably be because of
this<00:02:56.550> game<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.380> cooler<00:02:59.070> while<00:02:59.190> combined

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
this game this and cooler while combined

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.920 
this game this and cooler while combined
and<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.800> course<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.190> warfare<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:03.440> but

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and of course one warfare two but

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
and of course one warfare two but
anyways<00:03:06.930> native<00:03:07.920> fortress<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> pretty<00:03:08.820> good

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
anyways native fortress is a pretty good

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.520 
anyways native fortress is a pretty good
level<00:03:10.430> each<00:03:11.430> they<00:03:11.880> each<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.530> there's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
level each they each have there's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
level each they each have there's
different<00:03:13.830> styles<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.400> levels<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.360> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
different styles of levels and you get a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.100 
different styles of levels and you get a
couple<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.739> examples<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.640> levels<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.780> each

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
couple of examples of levels in each

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.140 
couple of examples of levels in each
style<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.310> there'll<00:03:20.489> be<00:03:20.519> another<00:03:20.820> I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
style so like there'll be another I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.310 
style so like there'll be another I
think<00:03:21.360> there's<00:03:21.510> another<00:03:21.690> level<00:03:21.989> called<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
think there's another level called the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.060 
think there's another level called the
great<00:03:22.560> gate<00:03:23.420> which<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.540> similar<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.500> it's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
great gate which is similar to this it's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.160 
great gate which is similar to this it's
not<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> same<00:03:26.519> level<00:03:26.700> obviously<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:28.019> has

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
not the same level obviously but it has

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.800 
not the same level obviously but it has
like<00:03:28.410> similar<00:03:28.709> sprites<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:30.690> know
