00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.100
 song sacrifice 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.630
 another supposed flagship of the ps 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.630
 vita 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.850
 it became another great game 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.230
 name and publicity but that in the end 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.230
 can offer much in return 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 the short answer is no 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 soul sacrifice is a game that meets 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.910
 with everything he promised and even 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.500
 exceeds expectations may not seem 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.210
 a game for all audiences but 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.489
 I'm pretty sure it would end 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.050
 hooking to anyone the truth is 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.420
 that when I first learned of his 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.070
 existence did not interest me much other 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.590
 20ma for a sony console that neither 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.080
 it's not even an elbow quark the reality is not 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.640
 could be more different this game is very 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.979
 different from the well-known god of the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.479
 war and that he blesses you so that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.430
 grow to your height because soul sacrifice 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.020
 he deserves it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 the story is quite curious and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.980
 original we played the role of a 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.680
 slave caught in a cell waiting 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 its execution at the hands of a crazy magician 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.590
 for good or for bad the destiny wants 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.080
 that the journal of that magician falls into 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.700
 our hands curiously apart from 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 to be able to speak the book has the ability 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.810
 of making us relive the memories of his 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.880
 author and little by little go knowing your 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.850
 history until you can reveal your secret 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.760
 darker a secret that would allow us 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.610
 survive in this way the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.110
 elements of achievement and playability 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.330
 we read the book envelopes we saw some 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.770
 parts like our appearance and name and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.380
 we live against different encounters 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 types of monsters is plausible that the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 creators of the game have dared to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.310
 create a totally new ip but more 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.780
 even if the cause has been dedicated 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 the whole Lord is very worked and he 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.930
 note to the naked eye creatures and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.330
 original locations 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.160
 note the orcs that bruise 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 deep and interesting characters and a 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.300
 really credible world 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.330
 it's about as I said about a bitmap game 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 although I have been able to realize that the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.500
 style is very different from the aforementioned god 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 of war for example the game is rather 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.710
 a mix between it and the devil may 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 cry originals even for the aesthetic 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.820
 it looks a bit like the latter 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.280
 battles are pretty agile but 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.840
 they require concentration and know what 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 it is being done at every moment because 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.950
 if you can not die easily by 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.510
 luck almost always we have companions 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.260
 that can resuscitate us or help us 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.700
 any way 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.290
 this also applies to the mode 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.790
 multiplayer where our allies 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.620
 can either revive the or choose 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.239
 sacrifice to take over a power 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.569
 greater and be able to end our 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.400
 enemies for themselves 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.769
 which opens doors to situations 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.389
 pretty curious where our friends 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.469
 they could betray us to be more 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.469
 strong in a game 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.409
 perhaps the weakest point of the game are 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 its graphics does not mean they are bad 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.310
 only that between so much excellence have 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.370
 a lower level sometimes the textures 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.170
 they seem from the ps2 and even ps1 though 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.969
 you can forgive because it is a 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.459
 mobile title and also with its gameplay 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.019
 fast you can hardly see the section 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 sound does not look much either 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.060
 some of the songs on the menus 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.500
 they drew attention in a positive way 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.810
 talking about the gameplay this is 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.120
 excellent the character moves very well 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.760
 and the mechanics are easy to learn but 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.409
 difficult to master as you wish 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.180
 the combats are fun about 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.939
 everything if we combine different spells and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.799
 we create curious combos there are elements 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.109
 rpg and our character becomes more 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.900
 powerful as it wins more and more 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.519
 hordes of enemies unfortunately not 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.829
 I could appreciate the two aspects of the game 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.599
 what better reviews I have not received your 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.030
 longevity can seemingly 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.980
 offer tens of hours of fun and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.660
 its multiplayer mode where several magicians 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.280
 they fight side by side 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.710
 the latter has to be really 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.630
 curious using the integrated microphone 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.770
 of the console play this great game with 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.260
 friends has to be an experience 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.670
 luckily really nice 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.980
 developers knew how to adapt the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.090
 mechanical to portable format 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 referring to the duration of the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.510
 phases is short to give us time 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.640
 to play a little game in transportation 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.110
 public or waiting for anything is 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.090
 a pity that many companies do not 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.500
 understand this concept at the end 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.030
 we end with games like resistance 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.010
 burning skies where to pass to your 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.780
 level you have to be half an hour playing and 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.100
 it takes five minutes valuable 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.380
 enter the game between both menu and 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.150
 so many scenes 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.350
 In short, it can be said that 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.550
 game has met all its 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.810
 objectives 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.460
 now it only remains to see if it will sell what 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.040
 well enough because I would like 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.160
 watch this franchise grow and play ss 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.110
 23 and those who come meanwhile the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.910
 soul sacrifice becomes one of 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.890
 at the moment few games 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.360
 essentials of the habitat and even 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.700
 may be the reason why you wanted 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.670
 do with one for this and for everything 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.380
 others stays with 8 I hope that I have 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.120
 liked the video for more information
