 one of the objects and accessories 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.020
 Most valued by our customers are 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.060

 advice what we want is to explain you 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.990
 what things do you have to take into account

 time to buy or sell a watch 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.550
 this type 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 Although it seems obvious the first thing that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.200
 let's look is the clock works 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.960
 this we will check normally seeing 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.100
 that the second hand is working and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 keeping in mind that watches 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.500
 they work either on batteries or on a string 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 or they are automatic in any of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.650
 the three cases we have to verify that the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.540
 seconds if the needles are 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.540
 working correctly 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.820
 Then we will examine the state 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.710
 general clock important data 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.710
 would be the status of the bracelet we 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.950
 would indicate more or less use the state of 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.010
 the crown is the part that receives the most 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.690
 blows of a clock and especially the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.610
 crystal that is smooth that does not have 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.400
 no scratched and of course no 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.400
 break type 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.900
 mechanically we are going to check that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.240
 the needles once we have separated 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.630
 normally this crown rotate 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.110
 perfectly without any obstacle and for 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.280
 Of course the closure works 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.920
 correctly it is not rusted and it remains 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 fixed correctly 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.670
 to start having an idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.290
 pricing of an item of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 this guy we divided into renewed the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.030
 watches in three ranges we would say the range 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.799
 average are watches that do not lose value 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.890
 over time we usually refer to

 to brands such as seico lotus festina and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.000
 trust of all the all 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.979
 customers watches design watches that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.509
 they become more striking with spheres 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.300
 much larger depending on the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.220
 fashions these in a way 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.700
 how much time goes by then they go 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.160
 losing its value and finally the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 high-end watches as would be the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.550
 much more conscientious with even the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.100
 inclusion of issued appraisal sheets 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.620

 steel because it's the most durable the most 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.580
 resistant to the contrary of what would be 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 the skin or especially the rubber that 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.640
 Acquires dirt more easily 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.610
