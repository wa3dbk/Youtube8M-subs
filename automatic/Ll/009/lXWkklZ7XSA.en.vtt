00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
sharks and stack sizes are such that it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
sharks and stack sizes are such that it
might<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.649> better<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.979> fold<00:01:05.190> here<00:01:05.399> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
might just be better to fold here and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160 
might just be better to fold here and
not<00:01:06.060> worry<00:01:06.300> about<00:01:06.360> playing<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> hand<00:01:07.020> from

it's good
it<00:01:15.420> balances<00:01:15.750> his<00:01:16.170> range<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.299> he's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> good

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it balances his range and he's a good

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
it balances his range and he's a good

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
also sets up a squeeze play which seems

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.669 
also sets up a squeeze play which seems
surprising<00:01:24.960> form<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.289> Queens<00:01:25.500> when

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
surprising form to have Queens when

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.499 
surprising form to have Queens when
someone<00:01:25.920> takes<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.190> shot<00:01:26.429> at<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> although<00:01:27.390> he

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
someone takes a shot at it although he

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
someone takes a shot at it although he

easier<00:04:08.130> for<00:04:08.400> Kyle<00:04:08.580> Julius<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.210> think<00:04:09.420> as<00:04:09.810> he

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
easier for Kyle Julius I think as he

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.050 
easier for Kyle Julius I think as he
says<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.650> g'wan<00:04:10.920> loo<00:04:11.100> after<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.520> hands<00:04:11.790> over

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
says to g'wan loo after the hands over

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.410 
says to g'wan loo after the hands over
he<00:04:12.870> doesn't<00:04:13.230> think<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.650> she<00:04:14.160> would<00:04:14.420> refuse

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
he doesn't think that she would refuse

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.270 
he doesn't think that she would refuse
to<00:04:15.660> bet<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.110> turn<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> river<00:04:16.770> with<00:04:17.250> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to bet the turn and the river with a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
to bet the turn and the river with a
strong<00:04:17.670> value<00:04:17.910> hand<00:04:18.300> yeah<00:04:18.810> he's<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.350> often

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
strong value hand yeah he's so often

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.440

what she's just going to check back with

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.270 
what she's just going to check back with
that<00:04:23.840> it's<00:04:24.840> hard<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.590> have<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> really

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
that it's hard for to have a really

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.620 
that it's hard for to have a really
strong<00:04:26.340> hair<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:26.970> she<00:04:27.060> checks<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.450> river

strong hair that she checks the river
with<00:04:27.840> by<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.320> way<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.740> disagree<00:04:29.250> strongly<00:04:29.640> with

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
with by the way I disagree strongly with

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.600 
with by the way I disagree strongly with
what's<00:04:30.030> tape<00:04:30.210> says<00:04:30.540> on<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.430> broadcast<00:04:32.430> when

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610

ridiculous<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.170> that's<00:04:37.230> only<00:04:37.380> because<00:04:37.470> you

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
ridiculous and that's only because you

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.710 
ridiculous and that's only because you
know<00:04:37.860> what<00:04:38.010> happens<00:04:38.370> later<00:04:38.580> that's<00:04:39.120> true<00:04:39.390> he's

betting for value he's trying to get
called<00:04:41.580> by<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.760> worse<00:04:41.970> hand<00:04:42.300> like<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.110> nice

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
called by a worse hand like the nice

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.080 
called by a worse hand like the nice
nines<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.070> world<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.400> 10-9<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
nines of the world in a 10-9 to the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.370 
nines of the world in a 10-9 to the
world<00:04:45.270> in<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.420> pocket<00:04:45.750> tens<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.200> world

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
world in the pocket tens of the world

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.240 
world in the pocket tens of the world
and<00:04:46.560> things<00:04:46.710> like<00:04:46.830> that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and things like that

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.740 
and things like that
right<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.700> stapes<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.150> saying<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.420> because

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
right and stapes is saying this because

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.150 
right and stapes is saying this because
he's<00:04:48.900> already<00:04:49.110> seen<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.500> outcome<00:04:49.860> although

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
he's already seen the outcome although

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.490 
he's already seen the outcome although
to<00:04:50.880> give<00:04:51.030> some<00:04:51.270> credit<00:04:51.570> here<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.960> think<00:04:52.440> that

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
to give some credit here I think that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.870 
to give some credit here I think that
that<00:04:52.920> was<00:04:53.010> at<00:04:53.100> least<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.310> small<00:04:53.550> part<00:04:53.790> of

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
that was at least a small part of

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360 
that was at least a small part of
Julia's<00:04:54.360> plan<00:04:54.630> was<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.260> Bluff<00:04:55.680> catch<00:04:55.920> if<00:04:56.160> he

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
Julia's plan was to Bluff catch if he

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.040 
Julia's plan was to Bluff catch if he
does<00:04:56.670> happen<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.060> get<00:04:57.210> check<00:04:57.390> right<00:04:57.570> sure
