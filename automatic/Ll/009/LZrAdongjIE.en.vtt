00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.950 

all<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.300> someone<00:00:09.300> asked<00:00:09.690> me<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
all right so someone asked me how the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.749 
all right so someone asked me how the
decomp<00:00:10.469> works<00:00:11.929> the<00:00:12.929> decomp<00:00:13.380> lever<00:00:13.620> only<00:00:14.549> needs

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
decomp works the decomp lever only needs

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.570 
decomp works the decomp lever only needs
to<00:00:14.910> press<00:00:15.210> down<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:16.379> two<00:00:16.859> inches<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.490> if

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to press down about two inches or so if

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.470 
to press down about two inches or so if
you<00:00:17.670> push<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.970> too<00:00:18.119> far<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:20.270> damage<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
you push it too far you can damage the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.599 
you push it too far you can damage the
ball<00:00:22.020> joint<00:00:22.410> here<00:00:22.789> in<00:00:23.789> order<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:25.460> crack<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ball joint here in order to crack the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.099 
ball joint here in order to crack the
valves<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.390> only<00:00:27.510> need<00:00:27.630> about<00:00:27.810> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
valves you really only need about that

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.609 
valves you really only need about that
much<00:00:28.369> movement<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
much movement and you really want to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.290 
much movement and you really want to
adjust<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.350> linkage<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.820> take<00:00:36.090> up

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
adjust the linkage so that you take up

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440 
adjust the linkage so that you take up
just<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.870> amount<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> slack<00:00:38.450> right

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
just the right amount of slack right

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
just the right amount of slack right
before<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> cracks<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> valves<00:00:40.649> open<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
before it cracks the valves open so a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270 
before it cracks the valves open so a
rest<00:00:42.210> position<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.620> firm<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
rest position it's it's it's firm so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.389 
rest position it's it's it's firm so
that<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> rod<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.690> rattle<00:00:46.219> but<00:00:47.219> then

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that the rod doesn't rattle but then

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
that the rod doesn't rattle but then
when<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> start<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.800> only<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
when you go to start it up you only have

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.750 
when you go to start it up you only have
to<00:00:50.219> push<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> couple<00:00:50.850> inches<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:53.489> crack

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to push it a couple inches to crack

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.689 
to push it a couple inches to crack
these<00:00:54.030> valves<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.820> course<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.649> push<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
these valves and of course you push it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.569 
these valves and of course you push it
down<00:01:00.260> start<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> bike<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> same<00:01:02.340> time

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
down start the bike at the same time

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
down start the bike at the same time
lift<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.059> obviously<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.229> bike<00:01:04.379> won't

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
lift it up obviously the bike won't

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
lift it up obviously the bike won't
start<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> lever<00:01:05.970> down<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.659> it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
start with the lever down because it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.210 
start with the lever down because it
opens<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> valves<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> whole<00:01:08.040> point

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
opens the valves that's the whole point

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.609 
opens the valves that's the whole point
of<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:10.250> ruin<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> starter

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
of it so that we don't ruin the starter

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.020 
of it so that we don't ruin the starter
you<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:13.770> never<00:01:13.979> use<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.880> all

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you could never use the thing at all

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
you could never use the thing at all
even<00:01:15.390> once<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.680> fine<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.430> wear

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
even once and be fine you'll just wear

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.950 
even once and be fine you'll just wear
your<00:01:17.790> battery<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.390> starter<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.869> faster

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
your battery and your starter out faster

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.969 
your battery and your starter out faster
it's<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:23.750> ease<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.290> starting<00:01:25.860> procedure

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it's just to ease the starting procedure

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
it's just to ease the starting procedure
so<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> motor<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.299> spinning

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so that the motor can get spinning

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
so that the motor can get spinning
before<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.200> actual<00:01:29.780> motor<00:01:30.780> turns<00:01:31.140> over<00:01:31.430> so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
before the actual motor turns over so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
before the actual motor turns over so
that's<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> close-up<00:01:36.900> shot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.439> how

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that's it can do a close-up shot of how

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.969 
that's it can do a close-up shot of how
that<00:01:37.829> looks

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
that looks

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
that looks
