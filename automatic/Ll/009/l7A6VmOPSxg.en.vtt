here is a full polish on painting with
much<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.309> power<00:00:38.579> than<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> middle<00:00:39.210> pallets

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
much more power than the middle pallets

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
much more power than the middle pallets
if<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.780> compare<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> non-integer<00:00:41.010> range

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
if you compare with a non-integer range

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
if you compare with a non-integer range
and<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.450> mass<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:42.960> terrible<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and there are mass that's terrible so I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.930 
and there are mass that's terrible so I
realized<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.829> red<00:00:47.309> fruits<00:00:47.610> pineapple

body<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.219> heavy<00:00:59.600> we<00:01:00.600> also<00:01:00.719> produce<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
body but not heavy we also produce a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.380 
body but not heavy we also produce a
phase<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> pinky<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.680> these

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
phase one the pinky that we are these

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
phase one the pinky that we are these
from<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> 2003<00:01:07.290> invasion<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.010> always<00:01:08.299> white

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
from the 2003 invasion so always white

I'm<00:01:09.540> Rosie<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.180> even

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
I'm Rosie and I think that is not even

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.740 
I'm Rosie and I think that is not even
produced<00:01:12.869> every<00:01:13.110> year<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> need<00:01:15.210> both<00:01:15.390> hair

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
produced every year so we need both hair

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
produced every year so we need both hair
so<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> paint<00:01:17.159> color<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.580> end<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so to get that paint color we end with a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.850 
so to get that paint color we end with a
part<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> red<00:01:18.630> wine<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.380> made<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
part of red wine that is made with the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760 
part of red wine that is made with the
black<00:01:20.040> grapes<00:01:20.250> Pinot<00:01:20.729> Noir<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> minute

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
black grapes Pinot Noir and in a minute

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.630 
black grapes Pinot Noir and in a minute
we<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.400> both<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.390> means<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:26.070> white<00:01:26.280> wine

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
we use both so that means the white wine

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
we use both so that means the white wine
is<00:01:26.880> made<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> three<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.990> wipes<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
is made with the three kind of wipes and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
is made with the three kind of wipes and
the<00:01:28.590> red<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.610> blend<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> whites<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the red we blend into the whites to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.600 
the red we blend into the whites to
produce<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.350> pink<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:33.210> black<00:01:33.869> grapes

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
produce the pink is made to black grapes

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.870 
produce the pink is made to black grapes
and<00:01:35.610> those<00:01:35.909> pinot<00:01:36.180> noir<00:01:36.860> ungentlemanly<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.670> we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and those pinot noir ungentlemanly if we

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
and those pinot noir ungentlemanly if we
produce<00:01:39.090> white<00:01:39.540> wine<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.439> red<00:01:41.189> one

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
produce white wine with it all red one

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
produce white wine with it all red one
with<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.509> two<00:01:42.780> completely

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
with it we just get two completely

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.790 
with it we just get two completely
one's<00:01:44.010> different<00:01:44.550> color<00:01:45.260> but<00:01:46.260> also<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
one's different color but also a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.270 
one's different color but also a
different<00:01:47.840> different<00:01:48.840> flavor<00:01:49.280> different

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
different different flavor different

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.180 
different different flavor different
kinds<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.660> that's<00:01:51.870> why<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> flavors<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:52.980> are

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
kinds so that's why the flavors here are

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.719 
kinds so that's why the flavors here are
completely<00:01:53.730> different<00:01:54.150> different<00:01:54.900> ones<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
completely different different ones and

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.510 
completely different different ones and
what's<00:01:56.729> amazing<00:01:56.970> here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.660> that<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.520> two

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
what's amazing here is that we have two

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.810 
what's amazing here is that we have two
wines<00:01:59.910> from<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> same<00:02:00.780> artists<00:02:01.580> it's<00:02:02.580> not

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
wines from the same artists it's not

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.140 
wines from the same artists it's not
exactly<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.690> blending<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.670> because

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
exactly the same blending but because

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.120 
exactly the same blending but because
the<00:02:06.540> part<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> blood<00:02:07.290> grapes<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.920> been

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
the part of the blood grapes have been

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.949 
the part of the blood grapes have been
used<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> red<00:02:08.970> wine<00:02:09.240> we<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.660> two<00:02:09.810> completely

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
used as a red wine we get two completely

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.310 
used as a red wine we get two completely
different<00:02:10.830> wines
