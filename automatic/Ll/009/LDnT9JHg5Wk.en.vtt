00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
likes just by doing that just because

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
likes just by doing that just because
again<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:51.000> broke<00:00:51.270> music<00:00:51.629> they<00:00:51.719> didn't<00:00:52.020> break

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
again it's broke music they didn't break

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.549 
again it's broke music they didn't break
things<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> looks<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
things up and looks like that so here it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410 
things up and looks like that so here it
is<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:56.100> far<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.030> rubato

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is as far as the time it's really rubato

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
is as far as the time it's really rubato
when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> play<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.440> yourself<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.010> pretty

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
when you play it yourself you can pretty

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
when you play it yourself you can pretty
much<00:00:59.370> play<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.760> notes<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
much play these notes with a lot of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.219 
much play these notes with a lot of
interpretation<00:01:02.600> again<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
interpretation again because it's the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.179 
interpretation again because it's the
Baroque<00:01:04.439> style<00:01:04.939> just<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.659> did<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.920> bars

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
Baroque style just what I did the bars

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
Baroque style just what I did the bars
and<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.150> whenever<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.140> felt<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.650> there

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and so that whenever I felt like there

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
and so that whenever I felt like there
was<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> downbeat<00:01:11.490> happening<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
was a downbeat happening all I know I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
was a downbeat happening all I know I
tried<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> bar<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.250> by

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
tried to make put a bar there by

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
tried to make put a bar there by
changing<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:16.259> meter<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> stuff<00:01:16.920> like

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
changing the the meter and stuff like

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
changing the the meter and stuff like
that<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.869> Baroque<00:01:19.080> music<00:01:19.110> added

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that really the Baroque music added

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
that really the Baroque music added
their<00:01:19.770> own<00:01:19.799> conventions<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> writing<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
their own conventions of writing the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
their own conventions of writing the
music<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.479> fit<00:01:21.780> their<00:01:21.900> music<00:01:22.170> better<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
music that fit their music better but I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
music that fit their music better but I
put<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.670> modern<00:01:24.030> convention<00:01:24.720> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
put it in more of a modern convention so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.240 
put it in more of a modern convention so
that<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.009> able<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> read<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:28.250> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that people would be able to read it so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:02:32.690 
that people would be able to read it so
let<00:01:29.759> me<00:01:29.939> try<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.420> this

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.400 

that's<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.880> first<00:02:34.090> major<00:02:34.269> section<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.959> would

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
that's the first major section I would

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.680 
that's the first major section I would
save<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.739> piece<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.340> mean<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:37.420> really<00:02:37.540> not

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
save this piece I mean it's really not

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.580 
save this piece I mean it's really not
that<00:02:37.750> difficult

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that difficult

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.050 
that difficult
you<00:02:38.739> just<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.069> be<00:02:39.190> aware<00:02:39.430> there's<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.819> few

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
you just have to be aware there's a few

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
like little sixteenth fast sixteenth

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.890 
like little sixteenth fast sixteenth
note<00:02:41.800> passages<00:02:42.370> if<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.780> isolate
