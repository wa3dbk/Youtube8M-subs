going fast and getting the most from
their<00:00:55.110> tires<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.460> cool<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
their tires so really cool to see this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.330 
their tires so really cool to see this
hit<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> market<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:57.690> talk<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
hit the market let's talk about it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.369 
hit the market let's talk about it
basically<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.449> new<00:01:00.870> tread

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
basically what you have is a new tread

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
basically what you have is a new tread
design<00:01:01.739> new<00:01:02.100> carcass<00:01:02.550> design<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.449> tread

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
design new carcass design so the tread

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.270 
design new carcass design so the tread
pattern<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.650> first<00:01:04.890> we'll<00:01:05.100> talk

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pattern is what we see first we'll talk

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
pattern is what we see first we'll talk
about<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.909> big<00:01:06.180> blocks<00:01:06.510> down<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
about that these big blocks down the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.630 
about that these big blocks down the
center<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.860> been<00:01:08.130> offset

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
center these have actually been offset

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.920 
center these have actually been offset
so<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.090> how<00:01:09.240> they're<00:01:09.390> staggered<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so you can see how they're staggered a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
so you can see how they're staggered a
little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> does<00:01:11.159> help<00:01:11.549> spread

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
little bit what that does help spread

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490 
little bit what that does help spread
the<00:01:12.119> load<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> tire<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the load out over the tire so it's a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.660 
the load out over the tire so it's a
wider<00:01:13.740> footprint<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> absorb

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
wider footprint it's going to absorb

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420 
wider footprint it's going to absorb
more<00:01:15.240> traction<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.290> very<00:01:16.439> important<00:01:16.920> control

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
more traction is very important control

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
more traction is very important control
and<00:01:17.610> steering<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.180> important<00:01:18.659> however

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and steering is very important however

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
and steering is very important however
Dunlop<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.460> emphasized<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> longevity

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
Dunlop really emphasized the longevity

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
Dunlop really emphasized the longevity
of<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.900> tire<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> absorbs

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of this tire and the way that it absorbs

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.039 
of this tire and the way that it absorbs
impacts<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.450> wants<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
impacts it really wants to make the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.690 
impacts it really wants to make the
tires<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.560> active<00:01:26.130> component<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.640> your

motorcycle suspension so it's designed
to<00:01:29.159> absorb<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.880> designed<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.299> work

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to absorb that it's designed to work

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
to absorb that it's designed to work

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you to ride the center one's okay those

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
you to ride the center one's okay those
are<00:01:34.590> great<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.310> side<00:01:35.549> knobs<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.030> even

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
are great the side knobs these are even

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
are great the side knobs these are even
more<00:01:36.390> exciting<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> block<00:01:37.710> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
more exciting so you have this block in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
more exciting so you have this block in
block<00:01:38.130> technology<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.329> it's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
block technology you can see how it's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
block technology you can see how it's
got<00:01:39.600> basically<00:01:40.049> smaller<00:01:40.650> raised<00:01:41.130> blocks

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
got basically smaller raised blocks

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
got basically smaller raised blocks
inside<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> larger<00:01:43.020> blocks<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
inside of the larger blocks on the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.830 
inside of the larger blocks on the
outside<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.070> technically<00:01:44.880> Dunlop<00:01:45.450> calls<00:01:45.689> us

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
outside now technically Dunlop calls us

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.060 
outside now technically Dunlop calls us
to<00:01:45.960> progressive<00:01:46.470> cornering<00:01:46.860> block

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to progressive cornering block

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
to progressive cornering block
technology<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.149> again

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
technology and what it does again

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
technology and what it does again
increase<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> footprint<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.310> creates<00:01:50.610> more

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
increase the footprint it creates more

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.210 
increase the footprint it creates more
biting<00:01:51.240> edges<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.680> more

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
biting edges as well so you have more

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
biting edges as well so you have more
traction<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.970> driving<00:01:54.450> force<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
traction more driving force and the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
traction more driving force and the
sidewalls<00:01:56.520> been<00:01:56.759> reinforced<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> made<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
sidewalls been reinforced and made in a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.300 
sidewalls been reinforced and made in a
certain<00:01:58.290> way<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> help

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
certain way that it's going to help

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950 
certain way that it's going to help
absorb<00:01:59.520> loads<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.360> side<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.750> well<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
absorb loads from the side as well so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.249 
absorb loads from the side as well so
basically<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.840> controlled<00:02:03.840> damping

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
basically there's a controlled damping

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
basically there's a controlled damping
rubber<00:02:04.560> technology<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.579> sidewalls<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
rubber technology on the sidewalls that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.749 
rubber technology on the sidewalls that
helps<00:02:06.540> absorb<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.380> impact<00:02:07.610> you're<00:02:08.610> also

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
helps absorb that impact you're also

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
helps absorb that impact you're also
going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> see<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> there<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.660> no<00:02:09.869> tie<00:02:10.140> bars

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to see that there are no tie bars

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
going to see that there are no tie bars
on<00:02:10.619> these<00:02:10.770> tires<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.879> old<00:02:12.030> geo<00:02:12.270> maxes<00:02:12.629> they

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
on these tires so the old geo maxes they

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.500 
on these tires so the old geo maxes they
at<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.020> these

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
at all these

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
at all these
these<00:02:13.840> tie<00:02:14.230> bars<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.650> would<00:02:14.739> tie<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:14.980> blocks

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
these tie bars that would tie the blocks

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.490 
these tie bars that would tie the blocks
together<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:16.360> created<00:02:16.689> a<00:02:16.750> very<00:02:16.930> rigid<00:02:17.170> tire

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
together that created a very rigid tire

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.470 
together that created a very rigid tire
and<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.459> was<00:02:18.579> great<00:02:18.790> those<00:02:18.970> were<00:02:19.060> obviously

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and that was great those were obviously

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.210 
and that was great those were obviously
awesome<00:02:19.840> tires<00:02:20.049> however<00:02:20.500> Dunlop<00:02:20.890> realized

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
awesome tires however Dunlop realized

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.350 
awesome tires however Dunlop realized
they<00:02:21.340> needed<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.790> little<00:02:22.030> bit<00:02:22.150> more

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
they needed a little bit more

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.960 
they needed a little bit more
flexibility<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.260> they<00:02:23.530> remove<00:02:24.099> those<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.819> can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
flexibility so they remove those you can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.490 
flexibility so they remove those you can
see<00:02:25.180> some<00:02:25.390> trace<00:02:25.629> evidence<00:02:25.870> they're<00:02:26.230> still

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
see some trace evidence they're still

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.800 
see some trace evidence they're still
connected<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.790> certain<00:02:28.180> extent<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.629> not

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
connected to a certain extent but not

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.960 
connected to a certain extent but not
anywhere<00:02:29.319> near<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.709> was<00:02:29.890> previously<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
anywhere near it was previously so a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.850 
anywhere near it was previously so a
little<00:02:31.299> bit<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.480> flexibility<00:02:32.200> what's<00:02:32.680> that

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
little bit more flexibility what's that

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.369 
little bit more flexibility what's that
going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.129> do<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.519> hard<00:02:34.090> terrain<00:02:34.329> where<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
going to do on hard terrain where the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.289 
going to do on hard terrain where the
ground<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.799> not<00:02:35.890> giving<00:02:36.250> way<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.730> tires<00:02:37.000> need

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
ground is not giving way the tires need

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.119 
ground is not giving way the tires need
to<00:02:37.420> be<00:02:37.510> able<00:02:37.599> to<00:02:37.780> flex<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.739> stay<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
to be able to flex a little to stay in

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.710 
to be able to flex a little to stay in
contact<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:39.700> it's<00:02:39.819> too<00:02:40.030> hard<00:02:40.209> services

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
contact if it's too hard services

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.970 
contact if it's too hard services
they're<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.109> going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> brush<00:02:41.500> off<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.890> each

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
they're just going to brush off of each

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
they're just going to brush off of each
other<00:02:42.159> so<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.239> allow<00:02:43.359> it<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> grip

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
other so it's going to allow it to grip

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.509 
other so it's going to allow it to grip
more<00:02:44.260> traction<00:02:44.620> more<00:02:44.950> control<00:02:45.280> better

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
more traction more control better

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.589 
more traction more control better
steering<00:02:45.879> you're<00:02:46.060> gonna<00:02:46.150> find<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.450> on<00:02:46.569> the

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
steering you're gonna find that on the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.430 
steering you're gonna find that on the
front<00:02:46.870> end<00:02:47.049> as<00:02:47.230> well<00:02:47.409> improve<00:02:48.159> steering<00:02:48.609> now

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
front end as well improve steering now

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.479 
front end as well improve steering now
let's<00:02:50.440> talk<00:02:50.590> about<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.829> sizing<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.340> talk

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
let's talk about the sizing on this talk

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.589 
let's talk about the sizing on this talk
is<00:02:51.670> very<00:02:51.819> important<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> motocross

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
is very important it's a motocross

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.839 
is very important it's a motocross
specific<00:02:53.200> tire<00:02:53.409> it<00:02:53.650> only<00:02:54.069> comes<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:54.700> big

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
specific tire it only comes for big

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.420 
specific tire it only comes for big
bikes<00:02:55.090> with<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.359> 19<00:02:55.750> inch<00:02:55.989> rear<00:02:56.409> wheel<00:02:57.040> size

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
bikes with the 19 inch rear wheel size

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.190 
bikes with the 19 inch rear wheel size
so<00:02:57.790> if<00:02:57.909> you're<00:02:58.060> running<00:02:58.239> an<00:02:58.510> 18<00:02:58.810> inch<00:02:58.959> rim

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
so if you're running an 18 inch rim

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.869 
so if you're running an 18 inch rim
you're<00:02:59.889> kind<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.190> out<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.340> luck<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.700> need<00:03:00.819> to

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
you're kind of out of luck you need to

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.520 
you're kind of out of luck you need to
look<00:03:01.000> at<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.180> geo<00:03:01.329> max<00:03:01.569> 8081

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
look at the geo max 8081
