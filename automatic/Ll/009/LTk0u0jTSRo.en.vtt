00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.119
 Solemn revelation of the i3 concept 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.890
 Coupe in the Hollywood Hills of Los 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.180
 angeles 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.950
 although the euphoria of most 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.320
 manufacturer of electric cars seemingly 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.509
 bmw relentlessly relies on the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640
 current drive and shows the compact 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.809
 electro car not just happened here 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.809
 in California 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.640
 want to be or have to be mobile and it is 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.010
 a city that gives cars 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.160
 We have a design studio too 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.270
 therefore 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.270
 here in california 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.530
 his design for cars comes from bavaria 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.050
 actually also california jubilation 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.870
 park about an hour east of l 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.790
 designworks has been working for 40 years 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.680
 For this numerous brands of the battery 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.380
 screwdriver to the gaming mouse is like that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 pretty much everything and also after the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.490
 Takeover by bmw 1995 has it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 nothing changed 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 next to cars will be headphones 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.890
 Differences page that has a reason 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 as once explained michael just on 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.470
 os bob for olympia 2014 work 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.040
 the same principles as with bmw 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.500
 Efficient dynamics program also apply 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 here and of course my influences 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 work on this book then the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.550
 work on the cars but I have to give them 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.580
 to say honestly it is primarily 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.320
 that is why the best for the us olympia 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.320
 team to do what we can 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.190
 inspiration new trends and ideas the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.680
 are looking for manufacturers like bmw in california 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.540
 but not only in the middle of the design 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 Silicon Valley at San Francisco 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.070
 research dirk rossberg and his team 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.850
 just how to turn off batteries 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.370
 second electric cars can use 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 caryarins were as usually as possible 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.320
 that means a vehicle temperatures 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.890
 outside 140 to only 20 25 degrees 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.940
 and if a battery these women and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.580
 the conditions no longer exist 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.280
 she is at home at work 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.930
 25 degrees in the garage still best services 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.930
 Perform for many many years 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.989
 and for example the climate technology in the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.599
 house control in and around san francisco 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.670
 are with over 5000 vehicles worldwide 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.260
 Most electric cars registered 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.709
 this results in completely new 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.350
 business areas bmws carsharing drive 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.560
 now offers a fleet of 70 here 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.510
 active for the first hour 0 12 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 cost dollars 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 unlike at drivenow in germany 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.150
 but can not be parked everywhere 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.950
 Electric cars have to charge therefore gives 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.920
 there are nine fixed stations in the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.330
 city ​​area a bit out of town 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.000
 drive out comes at a range 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.660
 of 120 kilometers, though 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.660
 into a sweat 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.090
 with the use active thereby 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.400
 drive to silicon valley 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.200
 it gives others the feeling of the future 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.909
 and the car is actually correct 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.349
 fun to the reach I have 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.909
 I still have 30 miles left on the clock 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.390
 So you have to go back quickly 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.390
 charging stations 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.510
 whether volkswagen mercedes or bmw in 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.569
 California researches all German 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.040
 manufacturer of new technologies 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.860
 strict environmental regulations ensure that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.860
 that remains so in the future
