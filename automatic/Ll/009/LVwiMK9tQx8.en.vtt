00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi everyone, I'm close and this is it 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 an informative video because it finally is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.719
 the third dlc of black was announced 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.700
 ops 2 or the 10 vengeance that will come out 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 on 2 July therefore finally between date 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.340
 an official date to this dlc so much 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.480
 expected and the stuff was the trailer 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.130
 official from the site of black ops that now 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.230
 I show you a bit the image by hand in the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 purple course and I'll explain a little 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.820
 my impressions of this new dlc where 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 we all start with multiplayer maps 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 which will be four as usual 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.680
 first it will be cov which will be located up 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.340
 an island of the Indian ocean and will be a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 brave environment but with leo with many 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.530
 trees a very natural environment then 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 very interesting with the second race 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 on duty 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 located on a bridge in 2 to several floors 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.789
 there are various car things 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.980
 then there was a pretty one too 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.500
 let's move on to the third will be rush that will be 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.090
 this inspires me very naively that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 it will be can from on a paintball area 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.670
 will be a very hectic map with zones 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.560
 very close together so it will be there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 much confrontation make the fourth peace 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 instead in the other venture that a remake 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.290
 of the summit map of black ops 1 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 in fact how could you have gone in each 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.520
 dlc are now making a remake of the first 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 that is the remake of inuk town 2025 indeed of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 usually the table already with the game the ok to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 2025 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
 in the second dlc it was then the remake of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 filing ranger in this agreement between the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 summit remake this year by no means 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.040
 will be that a military control center 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 then open its military base now 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.189
 we pass the part that interests us most 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.619
 or new to the new zombie app 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.329
 then new zombie will be called bari e 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.399
 I hope I said it well 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.140
 translated means it was buried right 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.000
 because this map will be nothing else 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.040
 a western town buried underneath 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 so very original land I must say 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.899
 like a very nice crowd like thing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.740
 could see here zombies still have the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.810
 blue eyes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.689
 so it is assumed they are still 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 check ric.tof even if blue but 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.290
 it looks more like a violet blue 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.450
 I think he still has to with the dark top e 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.670
 however the characters will be solids 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.120
 or miss irace mario martone stu 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.209
 linger 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.150
 then the die rais trance money e 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.950
 there will also be a new pro character 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.269
 a character who will be part of 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.980
 map means a character who 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.540
 you can check then i don't know why 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.670
 were not very clear about 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860
 this and we will not know if this 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.080
 character and friend or enemy then 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.970
 there is a bit 1 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.520
 an aura of mystery about this new one 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 character then there will be a new weapon 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.070
 a boffi weapon let's call it reagan mark ii 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.530
 in fact the evolution of the normal rega 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.360
 which as you can see from the video shoots anyway 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.790
 Green rays pro as I understand it was 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 much more powerful than the video yes 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.030
 he sees that he shoots like a vigilant not 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.100
 you suffer damage so I don't know if 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.620
 I knew the damage was removed 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.450
 from the explosion however and it will be a lot 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.760
 enhanced therefore precisely it seems a lot 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.280
 nice as a weapon then there will also be a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.800
 new because we can see a little bit 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.870
 during a trailer but not any 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.260
 however, they speak however already from the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.390
 trailer 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.760
 I hope you see from the image that 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.740
 a new drink can be glimpsed of which you do not 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.450
 you know nothing in practice and I was thinking 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.520
 before maybe seeing that they have returned 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.860
 in points to the old characters ie 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.510
 those of trance of da rai sport and us 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.640
 will also be new permanent parks 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.840
 so since they are the only ones 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.420
 characters they can use to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.160
 permanent will probably do it to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.340
 who else with the release of this cup 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.430
 concluded he can say that with a small one 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.530
 in fact curiosity if you notice putting the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.560
 various zombie maps that have come out can 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.420
 indeed of the rais you see this and bari and le 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.570
 last letters form the writing a ted 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.360
 and in practice it would be the driver of 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.250
 But transit if it continues the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.959
 third dlc 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.750
 maybe there will be no patom since 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.280
 however already been and was completed 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.570
 so maybe I'm thinking of that instead of 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.269
 to refurbish but I think a 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.400
 remake with with various but April cozzolino 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.620
 they will put 45 be cooked and domino maps 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.269
 I would however like to see this anyway 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.970
 that one takes and also takes the 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.160
 sincerely I do not know a new map 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.290
 I'll see how other updated videos 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.570
 both through the youtube and through 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.790
 my facebook page good guys 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.900
 stop in video restoring got e 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.269
 I hope I have said all the things 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.310
 essential in this regard 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.110
 dlc let me know comments what 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.520

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.990
 click on I like the video if if 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.610
 I liked this information 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.620
 immediately the desired belgium 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.810
 and sign up for the channel if you still don't 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.639
 described 3b of today is all a greeting a 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.639
 we all win at the mannequin's house 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.409
 there are the classic two presences here 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.229
 in front I go out never fail 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.310
 the fixed appointment is that this dies 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.030
 since he dies 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.030
 art out
