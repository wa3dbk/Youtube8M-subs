00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.130 

the<00:03:13.490> bowel<00:03:13.790> socket<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.330> covered<00:03:14.750> by<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:14.930> little

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
the bowel socket is covered by a little

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.200 
the bowel socket is covered by a little
plastic<00:03:15.470> cap<00:03:15.860> preventing<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.880> from<00:03:16.910> being

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
plastic cap preventing it from being

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.140 
plastic cap preventing it from being
damaged<00:03:17.870> by<00:03:17.930> dust<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.590> maybe<00:03:18.920> even<00:03:19.040> rain<00:03:19.490> its

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
damaged by dust or maybe even rain its

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.390 
damaged by dust or maybe even rain its
position<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.050> very<00:03:21.260> convenient<00:03:21.860> making<00:03:22.280> it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
position is very convenient making it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.640 
position is very convenient making it
possible<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> graduate<00:03:23.420> even<00:03:23.840> with<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.470> plug

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
possible to graduate even with the plug

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.550 
possible to graduate even with the plug
in<00:03:24.830> certain

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.770 

this<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> first<00:03:35.610> video<00:03:35.910> sample<00:03:36.480> now<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.710> is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
this is the first video sample now it is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.980 
this is the first video sample now it is
13:53

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
13:53

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.600 
13:53
so<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.160> Sun<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.610> pretty<00:03:42.240> high<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.960> sky<00:03:43.200> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
so the Sun is pretty high in the sky and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.460 
so the Sun is pretty high in the sky and
this<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> view<00:03:45.060> from<00:03:45.120> my<00:03:45.480> house<00:03:48.140> I'm<00:03:49.140> not

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
this is the view from my house I'm not

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.680 
this is the view from my house I'm not
holding<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.920> camera<00:03:50.100> with<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.580> tripod<00:03:50.970> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
holding the camera with the tripod this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.100 
holding the camera with the tripod this
is<00:03:52.520> I'm<00:03:53.520> actually<00:03:53.760> holding<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.420> with<00:03:54.690> my<00:03:54.750> hand

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
is I'm actually holding it with my hand

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.550 
is I'm actually holding it with my hand
and<00:03:55.610> let's<00:03:56.610> see<00:03:56.850> let's<00:03:57.390> try<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.660> zoom<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.850> maybe

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
and let's see let's try to zoom so maybe

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.810 
and let's see let's try to zoom so maybe
to<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.709> antenna<00:04:02.070> up<00:04:02.550> there<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> forty

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to that antenna up there this is a forty

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.920 
to that antenna up there this is a forty
times<00:04:06.140> optical<00:04:07.140> zoom<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:08.670> now<00:04:08.850> at<00:04:09.030> twenty

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
times optical zoom it is now at twenty

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.860 
times optical zoom it is now at twenty
three<00:04:10.170> times<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.920> am<00:04:10.950> already<00:04:11.870> pretty

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
three times and I am already pretty

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.990 
three times and I am already pretty
close<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.470> yep<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.239> let's<00:04:15.870> try<00:04:16.109> another

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
close to it yep so let's try another

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.200 
close to it yep so let's try another
object<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.480> do<00:04:22.070> something

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
object to do something

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.230 
object to do something
down<00:04:24.780> there<00:04:25.169> careful

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
down there careful

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.170 
down there careful
okay<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.139> now<00:04:28.410> at<00:04:28.919> food<00:04:29.250> for<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.610> time<00:04:29.789> zoom

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
okay it's now at food for the time zoom

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.260 
okay it's now at food for the time zoom
and<00:04:30.449> I'm<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:32.130> camera<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.430> seeing<00:04:32.639> farther

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
and I'm and the camera is seeing farther

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.890 
and I'm and the camera is seeing farther
than<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.539> can<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.110> basically<00:04:35.300> yeah<00:04:36.300> pretty<00:04:36.539> nice

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
than I can so basically yeah pretty nice

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.089 
than I can so basically yeah pretty nice
zoom<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.970> will<00:04:39.360> see<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.690> quality<00:04:39.960> if<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.949> is

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
zoom I will see the quality if it is

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.150 
zoom I will see the quality if it is
actually<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.150> good<00:04:42.360> or<00:04:43.349> if<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.650> bad<00:04:43.889> body

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
actually that good or if this bad body

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.330 
actually that good or if this bad body
and<00:04:44.759> sample<00:04:45.150> I'm<00:04:45.360> recording<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:46.169> screen<00:04:47.330> with

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and sample I'm recording a screen with

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.920 
and sample I'm recording a screen with
low<00:04:50.340> light<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:52.080> my<00:04:53.240> my<00:04:54.240> room<00:04:54.509> where<00:04:54.900> I

condition<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.430> low<00:05:02.580> lighting<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.560> screens

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
condition of low lighting the screens

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.640 
condition of low lighting the screens
can<00:05:04.979> be<00:05:05.099> seen<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.910> well<00:05:06.349> let's<00:05:07.349> try<00:05:07.530> with

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
can be seen really well let's try with

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.230 
can be seen really well let's try with
the<00:05:07.830> phone

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.779 

so<00:05:18.210> here<00:05:19.210> is<00:05:19.300> my<00:05:19.330> Nexus<00:05:19.780> 4<00:05:19.960> let's<00:05:20.560> see<00:05:21.070> this<00:05:21.580> is

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
so here is my Nexus 4 let's see this is

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.100 
so here is my Nexus 4 let's see this is
in<00:05:22.270> full<00:05:22.539> lighting<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:24.220> is<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:25.539> display<00:05:25.900> in

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
in full lighting this is the display in

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.219 
in full lighting this is the display in
my<00:05:26.590> phone<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.889> on<00:05:27.430> full<00:05:28.389> brightness<00:05:28.509> the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
my phone is on full brightness the

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.909 
my phone is on full brightness the
straight<00:05:29.470> of<00:05:29.590> zum-zum<00:05:30.360> something<00:05:31.740> okay

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
straight of zum-zum something okay

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.510 
straight of zum-zum something okay
the<00:05:33.930> mmm<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.380> screen<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.860> pretty<00:05:36.220> much

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
the mmm the screen is pretty much

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.129 
the mmm the screen is pretty much
visible<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:37.860> maybe<00:05:38.860> if<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.900> lower<00:05:40.900> the

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
visible and maybe if I lower the

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.070 
visible and maybe if I lower the
brightness<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.979> this<00:05:42.100> level<00:05:42.310> maybe<00:05:42.610> yeah<00:05:43.509> it

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
brightness to this level maybe yeah it

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.760 
brightness to this level maybe yeah it
is<00:05:44.229> definitely<00:05:44.380> better<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:46.710> my<00:05:47.710> room

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
is definitely better so this is my room

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.640 
is definitely better so this is my room
with<00:05:48.520> no<00:05:48.699> lighting<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.419> only<00:05:49.810> light<00:05:49.990> comes

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
with no lighting the only light comes

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.950 
with no lighting the only light comes
from<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:52.000> shut-ins<00:05:54.449> simple<00:05:55.449> test<00:05:55.720> in

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
from the shut-ins simple test in

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.420 
from the shut-ins simple test in
condition<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.500> extreme<00:05:56.680> low<00:05:57.190> lighting<00:05:59.430> from

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
condition of extreme low lighting from

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.600 
condition of extreme low lighting from
the<00:06:00.699> camera<00:06:00.970> itself<00:06:01.210> I<00:06:01.360> cannot<00:06:01.660> see<00:06:02.070> much<00:06:03.070> but

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
the camera itself I cannot see much but

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.700 
the camera itself I cannot see much but
I<00:06:04.740> think<00:06:06.150> everything

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.029 

yeah<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.370> think<00:06:11.550> it's<00:06:11.850> boring<00:06:12.270> but<00:06:13.009> pretty<00:06:14.009> much

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
yeah I think it's boring but pretty much

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.770 
yeah I think it's boring but pretty much
