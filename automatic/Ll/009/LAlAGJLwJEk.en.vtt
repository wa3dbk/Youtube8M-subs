the<00:00:34.829> front<00:00:35.100> blade<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:36.360> contemplating<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the front blade I was contemplating a

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.900 
the front blade I was contemplating a
micro<00:00:38.820> tech<00:00:39.320> but<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.890> wasn't<00:00:41.100> sure<00:00:41.309> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
micro tech but I really wasn't sure that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.229 
micro tech but I really wasn't sure that
I<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.420> carrying<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> knife<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.590> often

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
I would be carrying the knife that often

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
I would be carrying the knife that often
because<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.600> illegal<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.320> most<00:00:46.469> states

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
because they are illegal in most states

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850 
because they are illegal in most states
and<00:00:47.329> what<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> wanted<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> invest<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.530> of

and what I wanted to invest that kind of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
and what I wanted to invest that kind of
money<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> something<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.210> may<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.690> become

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
money and something that may just become
