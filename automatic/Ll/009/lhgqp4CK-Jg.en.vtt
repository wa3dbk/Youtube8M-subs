00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello a new live cooking test i 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.259
 I ordered such a pizza stone 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.170
 he is not here that is one 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.870
 normal bun because we recently at 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.570
 friends greetings to take off and niki 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 a very great pizza eaten 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.820
 have and they have an extra pizza 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 stone for the grill I think 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 that was made of cast iron but there is also 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.240
 which is made of scrap and there I have me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 an ordered as amazon I link 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.880
 Take a look at it now 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.130
 pilot experiment 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 So I just have one now 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 yeast dough so bought a pizza dough from 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 Henglein the little Henglein all 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 I really like products and then 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.160
 I just have tomato sauce so 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 Passed tomatoes a bit spiced 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.420
 then have salt and pepper with garlic 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 I spread a little ham on it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.620
 on the one half ham on the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 other half salami and mozzarella 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.050
 this is the one we like here 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.300
 very much like to dunk on such pizzas and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.520
 we want to see if that works my husband 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 is just down the grill and tried 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.830
 to heat up 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.570
 you have to do something like that at 250 degrees for 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 about three to four minutes on the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.040
 put hot stone and then you should 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 work and I'm curious if it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:23.369
 that does 150 ok so you have to briefly 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 wait here for the pizza of the appointment 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.380
 has wanted drink and and that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 Mom is just a salami it is now 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.100
 First only a try 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.479
 okay what else I ordered with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 the scene already with his shovel 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.979
 We'll get ours right now 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.070
 that's quite big there fits my 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.750
 whole pizza on it looks like that will be 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 We will then we will 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.970
 Try this stone bit of flour 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.310
 there with it and then it should be 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.659
 Actually that works too 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 Do not bake so much but you have to 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.530
 watch should not be too much more 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.680
 otherwise you burn the same below 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 because it is still a big heat with 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.869
 250 degrees or how much was that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.580
 now look the mega cool now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.120
 we have about five minutes in it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
 and that's how it looks now 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.000
 we have to look a bit longer 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.130
 we do not even get better at this 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.390
 stone but she already sees 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:28.830
 make really delicious joke out of it where 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.960
 We correctly with alina really good 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.380
 a look which one you have, unfortunately, 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.360
 fold over did not fit on it that way 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.240
 Now I am looking forward to yours 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:03:14.520

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.430

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:55.639

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.900

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.900

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.500
 on the 8th we have to look 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:16.250

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:23.599
