00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 hello like I've never seen a jam 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.160
 of banana or banana because I have decided 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.560
 make myself a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
 but the grace of the recipe is to learn 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.740
 how to make a jam so you can 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.740
 use your favorite fruit 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.859
 we will start by chopping half a kilo of 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.329
 banana 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.620
 we will put the banana in a bowl and 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 we will add about 150 grams of sugar 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.489
 sugar not only gives you a sweet taste but 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.489
 that will also help you stay 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.530
 we will squeeze the juice of half a lemon 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.250
 no no no 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.070
 we mix everything well and we'll leave it 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.670
 rest at least two hours 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.670
 and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.960
 in two pots with boiling water 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.450
 we will put the lid and the bottle in the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.579
 which are we going to store the jam 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.380
 we will leave several minutes and thus these 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.380
 containers are sterilized 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.050
 In a pot add the banana 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.770
 and we will remove it so that it does not 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.770
 hit us 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.970
 when the banana arrives for a while 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.189
 softer and then we can go 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.300
 crushing so that in the end we stay 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.610
 a pasta 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.790
 when it thickens a bit we can turn off the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.790
 fire 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.590
 We pour the preparation into the jar of 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.250
 glass that we have sterilized up to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 leave it full 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.149
 or 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.900
 we clean the edges well, cover it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.330
 well and we'll turn it around so that it 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.770
 make the vacuum 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.900
 and when it cools, it will be ready 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 Well, this sure gives you for some 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.800
 extraordinary breakfasts I hope that you 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 have liked until the next
