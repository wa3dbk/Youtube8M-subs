00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
will have to modify the plate for it a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
will have to modify the plate for it a
little<00:00:25.949> bit<00:00:27.500> here's<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.769> holder<00:00:30.380> plate<00:00:33.170> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
little bit here's the holder plate and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
little bit here's the holder plate and
you<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.920> these<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> 870<00:00:36.300> holes

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
you see that the these are the 870 holes

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.180 
you see that the these are the 870 holes
when<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> eat<00:00:38.399> 71<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:40.170> bigger<00:00:40.530> than<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> other

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
when I eat 71 is bigger than the other

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.720 
when I eat 71 is bigger than the other
so<00:00:41.520> when<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> 88<00:00:42.809> 7<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> same<00:00:44.460> size

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so when the 88 7 they're the same size

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.860 
so when the 88 7 they're the same size
so<00:00:46.370> just<00:00:47.370> start<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> hardware

the<00:02:48.010> nylon<00:02:48.940> spacers<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:52.330> you're<00:02:52.510> going<00:02:52.630> to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the nylon spacers one you're going to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.949 
the nylon spacers one you're going to
leave<00:02:52.870> half-inch<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.770> other<00:02:53.950> one<00:02:54.959> you're

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
leave half-inch the other one you're

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.100 
leave half-inch the other one you're
going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.290> shave<00:02:57.120> 1/32<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.209> an<00:02:58.510> inch<00:02:58.690> off<00:02:59.080> of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
going to shave 1/32 of an inch off of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.600 
going to shave 1/32 of an inch off of
one<00:03:00.100> side<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.720> because<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:05.400> pins<00:03:06.400> and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
one side and that's because the pins and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.090 
one side and that's because the pins and
knees<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.630> rearward<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.769> actually

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
knees the rearward one is actually

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.559 
knees the rearward one is actually
shorter<00:03:09.730> than<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.660> front<00:03:10.810> one<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.360> let's<00:03:13.360> just

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
shorter than the front one so let's just

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.080 
shorter than the front one so let's just
say<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.959> is<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.410> gun<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.400> put<00:03:15.910> them<00:03:15.970> on

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
say this is a gun if you put them on

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.970 
say this is a gun if you put them on
there<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.840> exaggerated<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:17.920> I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
there like that this exaggerated but I

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.680 
there like that this exaggerated but I
mean<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.519> side<00:03:19.060> panels<00:03:19.390> are<00:03:19.420> going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.630> be

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
mean the side panels are going to be

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.910 
mean the side panels are going to be
