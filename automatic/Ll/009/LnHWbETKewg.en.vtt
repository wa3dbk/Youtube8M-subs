gonna<00:01:38.460> walk<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> thought<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> would

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
gonna walk from me so I thought I would

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
gonna walk from me so I thought I would
just<00:01:40.079> bring<00:01:40.700> various<00:01:41.700> types<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> natural

just bring various types of natural

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.210 
just bring various types of natural
makeup<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.950> what

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
makeup because I know that's really what

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.219 
makeup because I know that's really what
they<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.820> their<00:01:44.909> models<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
they do for their models and then it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.399 
they do for their models and then it
also<00:01:46.439> brought<00:01:46.770> two<00:01:47.070> palettes<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.060> case

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
also brought two palettes just in case

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.929 
also brought two palettes just in case
because<00:01:49.409> last<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.829> was<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.880> my

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
because last time I was there for my

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.700 
because last time I was there for my
casting<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.049> makeup<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.530> me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
casting they put a little makeup on me

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.889 
casting they put a little makeup on me
he's<00:01:53.100> naked<00:01:53.369> too<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.909> me<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.750> brought

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
he's naked too on me but I just brought

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.209 
he's naked too on me but I just brought
naked<00:01:55.200> ones<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> only<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.040> have

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
naked ones that's the only one I have

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.280 
naked ones that's the only one I have
then<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> brought<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.329> Too<00:01:57.509> Faced<00:01:57.780> matte<00:01:58.079> eye

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
then I brought the Too Faced matte eye

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
then I brought the Too Faced matte eye
palette<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> actually<00:01:59.219> use<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> dark

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
palette which I actually use this dark

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.440 
palette which I actually use this dark
brown<00:02:00.420> color<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.170> an<00:02:01.860> eyeliner

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
brown color as an eyeliner

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.730 
brown color as an eyeliner
so<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.900> thought<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.380> would<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.500> good

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
so I thought that would be good

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.289 
so I thought that would be good
especially<00:02:03.979> because<00:02:04.460> not<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:04.939> very<00:02:05.090> natural

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
especially because not it's very natural

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.880 
especially because not it's very natural
then<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.750> wasn't<00:02:06.049> sure<00:02:06.229> if<00:02:06.320> I'd<00:02:06.409> be<00:02:06.439> doing<00:02:06.770> my

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
then I wasn't sure if I'd be doing my

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.800 
then I wasn't sure if I'd be doing my
own<00:02:06.920> hair<00:02:07.280> too<00:02:07.670> which<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.030> probably<00:02:08.270> won't<00:02:08.630> be

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
own hair too which I probably won't be

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.690 
own hair too which I probably won't be
because<00:02:09.319> um<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.220> know<00:02:10.310> all<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.580> girls

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
because um you know all the girls

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.650 
because um you know all the girls
they're<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.239> truly<00:02:12.020> capable<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.530> doing<00:02:12.950> hair

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
they're like truly capable of doing hair

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.720 
they're like truly capable of doing hair
but<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.840> thought<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.860> case<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.430> would<00:02:16.580> bring

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
but I thought just in case I would bring

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.750 
but I thought just in case I would bring
a<00:02:16.940> brush<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.599> this<00:02:18.440> do<00:02:18.680> frizzing<00:02:19.100> spray<00:02:19.370> now

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
a brush and this do frizzing spray now

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.309 
a brush and this do frizzing spray now
I'm<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.180> gonna<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.540> into<00:02:20.690> typical<00:02:21.110> stuff
