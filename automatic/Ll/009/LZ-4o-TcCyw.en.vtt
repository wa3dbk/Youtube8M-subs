00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.880
 back on our screens the alpha 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 version is now for several weeks

 Unfortunately, not as press 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 disposal was during the final 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.720
 Play the Milky Way galaxy 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 settled and us after best 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 openworld sandbox give her the freedom 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
 optionally has space pirate 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 bounty hunter dealer or everything up 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.859
 once we get with the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.800
 alpha is just a kind of demo technology 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.239
 including combat gameplay taste 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 the scenarios are a good one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.540
 getting into the game in general and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 convey the complex but accessible 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 Implemented control is allowed by the player 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.140
 a first mission several tons 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.090
 Shooting thus learning to aim 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.590
 of objects and the room navigation 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 know because first the ship must 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.640
 logically in shot range 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 Immediately it becomes recognizable 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 Immersion is also great in song 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.270
 the theme of the cockpit is not just that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.390
 ornament but includes all has 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.650
 elements in a functional way 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.909
 to target detailed information 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.070
 can be viewed here 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.990
 as well as the classic elettra in it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.200
 the cockpit center and machines 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.280
 administration option on the right side 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.810
 at any time, the player to view 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
 wander through the pilot's cabin 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 to let 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.470
 in the best case, even the achilles rift 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.509
 Support more about that later 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.560
 control technology will dozens 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.600
 Adjustment possibilities offered by 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
 Joystick over keyboard and mouse all the way 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 to the gamepad all input devices 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 can be freely configured and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.409
 take a direct influence on that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.509
 game happen 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.189
 which means nothing else in the fight 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.790
 as constantly shoving and turbo too 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.799
 adjust 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 the enemy's goal always in the crosshairs 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.070
 to keep and navigate the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.560
 always one step ahead of the field 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.570
 the playable space flyer sidewinder 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.000
 already gives a lot of space joy 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 equipped with laser pos he cares 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 for pretty light effects and explosion 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 if the weapon does not miss your target 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.759
 other types of weapons like the burst 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.799
 Lasers or rockets are allowed in the scenarios 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.780
 course to be tried something thoroughly 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.640
 can be challenging just when 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 it against several opponents at the same time 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.290
 thing goes and these you in the neck 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.180
 sit tight to the gameplay belongs as well 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.340
 the varying shot frequency many 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.200
 weapons have the higher the rate of fire 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.910
 the higher the heat development of the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.940
 weapons and the resulting one 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.620
 stronger signature of your spaceship it 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.230
 is not exactly imagine as helpful 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.459
 to be connected 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.840
 it's always nice with the bbi blazer 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.610
 classic battle and you have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.560
 first the shields are allowed to crack 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.319
 the multi cannon numerous small ones 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.120
 quick helper the rest of the lines too 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.410
 an anaconda transporter is waiting for it 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.150
 get shot of you 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.530
 but who are as clever as in 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.900
 our gameplay is different 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.590
 Anaconda rear jams and means so we 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.030
 done it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.799
 should not be surprised that the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.989
 pilots and thus the accompanying protection 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.359
 at the same time it is around with sparkling 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.840
 spark the dying of the space fighter 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.840
 to celebrate 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.980
 since you have already asked yourself 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.690
 have as eli dangerous with 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.870
 I thought I'll take you 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.390
 So let's start with here 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:21.550
 So we in the game and it feels 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:25.270
 really damn good at the intense 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.709
 feelings is immediately there and he henceforth the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.410
 quite clearly in that the cockpit like that 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.450
 Beautifully designed is for us directly 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 You can turn around to look around 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.810
 like for example down there is one 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.980
 small medicine box should thus one 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.630
 Take care in Asturias 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.100
 suffice if you look below to 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.810
 looks then you see, for example, too 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.940
 a handbook a shove handbook and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.000
 some coast where there is something on it 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.540
 hard to say what it's advantage of 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.150
 all immersive optics here in the ship 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.500
 cockpit is also that that has 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.000
 automatically does not just customize that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500
 We see directly that he played 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.019
 can make the difference as to 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.209
 for example the radar or the infos about 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.280
 the ship if we left the head 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.620
 then they would turn this immediately 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.480
 this ad with information about 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.590
 target that we normally display 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.930
 without inscription with the keys 123 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.680
 could include 1 for the left 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.060
 has page 3 for the right side like 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.979
 she can then directly with vias de 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.419
 I'll show you that 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.610
 maybe here if I have a goal 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.680
 have captured element 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.300
 now it is just that 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.129
 then appears when I think 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.419
 head in the direction looks as you can see 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.340
 perhaps again the effect that 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.340
 hides that again 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.830
 so clear advantage is here with the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.310
 head tracking the cycle that you look at 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.020
 may look always nice one 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.700
 Panoramic window above you can see the 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.930
 Planets that would have to be synonymous in the 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.430
 look also see cut 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.150
 so you can always look for 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.950
 Eight times, enemy spaceships 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 now on the cockpit on the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.390
 Lighting on the light effects 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.860
 inside the cockpit so now the 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.500
 Sun obscured by Asturias it will 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.820
 dark 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.330
 now it is brighter again that is too 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.310
 a wonderful effect of simply this 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.890
 brings depth with pure and that is just 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.560
 this depth we only with oculus 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.560
 rift can understand 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.699
 Let's take the smaller one here 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:47.840
 ah there is proof again, after all 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.840
 it would be a bit too big with that 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.980
 and that's already happened the ship 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.950
 is broken i jumped up and 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.140
 I have now frantically turned away 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.730
 but it's a cool feeling 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:12.120
 definitely okay the rift makes it clear 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.100
 so definitely what is possible with the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.840
 theme immersion and, above all, space 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.410
 play 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.410
 It will be a great thing
