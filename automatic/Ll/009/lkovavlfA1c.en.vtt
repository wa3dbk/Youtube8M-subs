00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
they were you know they were said the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300 
they were you know they were said the
dissident<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> doesn't<00:01:16.680> represent<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
dissident just doesn't represent the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.859 
dissident just doesn't represent the
Iraqi<00:01:17.580> people<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.630> what

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Iraqi people but that's that's what

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.530 
Iraqi people but that's that's what
happens<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.520> free<00:01:20.520> societies<00:01:20.700> where<00:01:21.240> people

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
happens in free societies where people

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.620 
happens in free societies where people
try<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> draw<00:01:22.020> attention<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.530> themselves<00:01:22.740> and

try to draw attention to themselves and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
try to draw attention to themselves and
so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.930> guess<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.100> effective<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so I guess he was effective because it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
so I guess he was effective because it
caused<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> say<00:01:27.570> something<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.380> now
