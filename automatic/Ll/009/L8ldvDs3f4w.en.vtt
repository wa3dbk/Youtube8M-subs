started working out this week for those
of<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> wondering<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.750> I<00:01:15.750> actually

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of you wondering about that I actually

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
of you wondering about that I actually
took<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.070> splint<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.540> rubber

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
took my splint out on all my rubber

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
took my splint out on all my rubber
bands<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:20.130> work<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.820> couldn't

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bands out to work out because I couldn't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.149 
bands out to work out because I couldn't
breathe<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.630> mouth<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.860> I've

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
breathe through my mouth and so I've

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
breathe through my mouth and so I've
probably<00:01:23.430> had<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.060> splint<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:25.110> more

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
probably had my splint out a little more

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350 
probably had my splint out a little more
than<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.770> surgeon<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.330> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
than my surgeon would like but when I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
than my surgeon would like but when I
saw<00:01:27.600> him<00:01:27.780> today<00:01:27.930> he<00:01:28.140> said<00:01:28.350> everything<00:01:28.770> looks

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
saw him today he said everything looks

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
saw him today he said everything looks
good<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.570> doesn't<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.930> won't<00:01:31.049> hurt

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
good so what he doesn't know won't hurt

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.030 
good so what he doesn't know won't hurt
him

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
guys watched like one of my very first

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.429 
guys watched like one of my very first
videos<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.739> um<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.689> x-ray<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.109> showed

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
videos but um this is the x-ray I showed

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.679 
videos but um this is the x-ray I showed
then<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.109> can<00:02:26.260> see<00:02:26.409> my<00:02:26.590> bottom<00:02:26.980> jaw<00:02:27.219> is

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
then and so you can see my bottom jaw is

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.039 
then and so you can see my bottom jaw is
in<00:02:28.689> front<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:30.069> my<00:02:30.609> upper<00:02:30.819> jaw<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.629> hard<00:02:31.930> to

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
in front of my upper jaw this is hard to

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.720 
in front of my upper jaw this is hard to
do<00:02:32.230> with<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.680> camera<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:33.159> going<00:02:33.310> backwards

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
do with the camera but going backwards

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.210 
do with the camera but going backwards
and<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.590> was<00:02:35.769> from<00:02:36.120> what<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.390> from

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
and so this was from what is this from

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.280 
and so this was from what is this from
August<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.489> last<00:02:39.519> year<00:02:39.939> so<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.599> was<00:02:40.810> last

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
summer before I got my braces on and

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:54.140 
summer before I got my braces on and
then<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.909> one<00:02:46.859> was<00:02:47.859> taken<00:02:48.069> today<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:51.340> so

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
what I was saying about the titanium

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.719 
what I was saying about the titanium
plates<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:01.720> asked<00:04:02.409> my<00:04:02.620> surgeon<00:04:03.069> today<00:04:03.250> to

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
he did because I knew bits and pieces

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.629 
he did because I knew bits and pieces
but<00:04:08.889> I<00:04:09.389> didn't<00:04:10.389> know<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:11.139> whole<00:04:11.319> thing<00:04:11.639> so

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
but I didn't know the whole thing so

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.379 
but I didn't know the whole thing so
they<00:04:13.359> cut<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.409> upper<00:04:14.650> jaw<00:04:14.829> up<00:04:15.220> here<00:04:15.970> cuz<00:04:16.239> it's

they cut the upper jaw up here cuz it's

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.330 
they cut the upper jaw up here cuz it's
just<00:04:16.449> your<00:04:16.720> sinuses<00:04:17.229> right<00:04:17.289> here<00:04:17.769> kind<00:04:18.039> of<00:04:18.190> so

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340

slid back so I have like a bone
overlapping<00:04:32.300> bone<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.949> just<00:04:34.220> heals

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
overlapping bone and that just heals

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.149 
overlapping bone and that just heals
without<00:04:34.699> plates<00:04:35.300> or<00:04:35.569> screws<00:04:36.139> which<00:04:36.439> is<00:04:36.620> really

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
without plates or screws which is really
