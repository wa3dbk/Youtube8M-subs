00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:45.620 

take<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.490> thread<00:01:34.820> really<00:01:35.270> close<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.720> fold

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.350 

and<00:02:41.159> hide<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.340> thread<00:02:42.610> by<00:02:42.819> passing<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.940 

so<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.320> gathers<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.860> bit
