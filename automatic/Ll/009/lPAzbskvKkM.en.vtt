00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
similar personalities they will do

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.190 
similar personalities they will do
horseback<00:04:30.880> riding<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.540> so<00:04:31.690> that's<00:04:31.900> a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
horseback riding and so that's a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.440 
horseback riding and so that's a
similarity<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.070> they<00:04:33.310> both<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.420> I

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
similarity that they both have so I

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.110 
similarity that they both have so I
would<00:04:34.630> say<00:04:34.750> overall<00:04:35.080> sage<00:04:35.830> gets<00:04:36.310> an<00:04:36.580> eight<00:04:36.910> or

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
would say overall sage gets an eight or

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.310 
would say overall sage gets an eight or
nine<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:38.670> think<00:04:39.670> she<00:04:40.660> looks<00:04:40.840> up<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.200> my

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
nine so I think she looks up to my

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.440 
nine so I think she looks up to my
expectations<00:04:42.030> hopefully<00:04:43.030> she'll<00:04:43.210> live<00:04:43.330> up

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450
