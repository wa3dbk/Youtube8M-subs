00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.840
 cost of 13 pesos in the app store for 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.720
 they go and buy it since that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.070
 Well the truth is that it is a pretty price 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.800

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.709
 and select the this bad side we have 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.560

 third that will come next 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.260
 update I imagine myself this one we have 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.629
 what is this in this part uruguay 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.400
 I imagine that those who are leaving 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.010
 unlocking as you pass the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.720
 missions this let's play what is the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.209
 good side since the bad side we're going 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.099
 to unlock when we have this 10 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.010
 more stars in this case we have 10 and 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.049
 we must collect what is this 20 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.450
 in general to be able to play the wrong side 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.250
 let's go to the good side this and let's go 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.349
 to play the first chapter so that they see 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.970
 this so that they see what wave is here 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.579
 we have what is this let's call him 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.290
 bird, because this in this case and good 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.450
 Well, if we launch it, this bird has 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.060
 this the specialty of launching this there 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.790
 a swipe at the structure where it 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.889
 find there is because if I'm not 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.159
 this one to be able to knock it down and well 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.870
 after here it is already the same 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.220
 of always not scoring and everything 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.620
 others here in this case we collect 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.870
 three stars we collect here 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.790
 to go to move on to the next one of this 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.650
 next game to repeat the game and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.019
 to go to the main menu or if 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.459
 we want to buy packages or powers not 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.039
 we can be here the shopping letter 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.539
 let's go to the next mission not 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.910
 let's go on what is this menu 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.260
 this the main one to go to a 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.410
 most advanced mission for 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.030
 do not go to this one by one in this case 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.600
 we have what this other bird is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.370
 that this one is in charge of what is the 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.110
 gravity to be able to knock it down by 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.360
 the gravity as we can see how 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.610
 we can see we did not get knocked down a lot but 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.340
 damage was done there as we can see in 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 what is the structure that the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.820
 he could knock down is not here the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.680
 we select and as we can see from 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.050
 same way does the structure hurt 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.090
 with gravity so you can this one 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.560
 die not what is this the pro that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.030
 continued there we were left with an equal no 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.980
 it's the same and good is the same method 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.540
 of not always the qualification the point 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.400
 I also wave that we would already be in all 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.200
 the sagas in in wiiware if we say a 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.450
 high but hey it's because we just 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.010
 play recently and good as this one go 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.780
 to see what a game that really is worth 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.760
 worth spending those 13 pesos in the span 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.250
 to be able to buy it is a game 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.860
 it's really worth it to spend 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.180
 those 13 pesitos this and good because this one 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.560
 he left his opinion there in the 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.090
 comments that tell me how about them 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.220

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.290
 caught in buying or not this at the end of 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.000
