00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
coach when I came to see you early this
spring<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.920> talked<00:00:41.190> about<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.610> learning

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
spring we talked about the learning

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
spring we talked about the learning
curve<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.960> indicated<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> me<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
curve and you indicated to me the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.850 
curve and you indicated to me the
learning<00:00:44.040> curve<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> system<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.710> be

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
learning curve on this system it can be

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
learning curve on this system it can be
pretty<00:00:47.039> steep<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> guys<00:00:48.030> sooner<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.170> later<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
pretty steep and guys sooner or later it

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.080 
pretty steep and guys sooner or later it
slows<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.039> sounds<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.940> you're

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
slows down sounds like what you're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
slows down sounds like what you're
saying<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.260> guys<00:00:52.590> know

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
saying is now that now that guys know

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.350 
saying is now that now that guys know
the<00:00:53.010> terminology<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.180> what

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the terminology they kind of know what

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
the terminology they kind of know what
to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.039> quicker<00:00:56.280> now

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to do they can move a little quicker now

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
to do they can move a little quicker now
no<00:00:57.480> question<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> i<00:00:58.320> mean<00:00:58.500> there's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
no question about it i mean there's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.939 
no question about it i mean there's
probably<00:00:59.690> five<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.719> six<00:01:01.050> concepts<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.770> got

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
probably five or six concepts they got

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.920 
probably five or six concepts they got
to<00:01:02.039> learn<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.609> pattern<00:01:03.149> maxima<00:01:03.600> zone

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to learn from a pattern maxima zone

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.469 
to learn from a pattern maxima zone
defense<00:01:04.409> standpoint<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> mix<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
defense standpoint and the you a mix and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
defense standpoint and the you a mix and
match<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:07.020> throughout<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> year<00:01:07.830> through

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
match those throughout the year through

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
match those throughout the year through
our<00:01:08.310> coverages<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.420> once<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.750> learn

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
our coverages but really once they learn

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
our coverages but really once they learn
those<00:01:10.110> concepts<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.430> got<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> down

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
those concepts they kind of got it down

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.280 
those concepts they kind of got it down
so<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.750> they're<00:01:12.930> doing<00:01:13.049> new

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so it's not like they're doing new

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
so it's not like they're doing new
learning<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.799> install<00:01:14.220> something<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.509> we've

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
learning and install something so we've

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
learning and install something so we've
basically<00:01:15.930> been<00:01:16.229> doing<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> since<00:01:17.220> last

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
basically been doing that since last

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.539 
basically been doing that since last
year<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.720> time<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.189> did<00:01:20.369> pretty

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
year at this time and we did pretty

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
year at this time and we did pretty
consistent<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.240> our<00:01:21.330> teaching<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> what

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
consistent in our teaching and what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
consistent in our teaching and what
we've<00:01:22.229> been<00:01:22.259> doing<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.040> anything<00:01:23.430> more

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we've been doing it's like anything more

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
we've been doing it's like anything more
you<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.090> something<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.659> create<00:01:24.960> habits<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you do something to create habits that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
you do something to create habits that
you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.960> communication

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you can be at it so the communication

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
you can be at it so the communication
has<00:01:28.680> been<00:01:28.710> well<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.000> players<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
has been well and the players are the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.359 
has been well and the players are the
new<00:01:30.600> solid<00:01:30.990> job<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.590> learning<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.220> stuff

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that we've installed and then this guy

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260 
that we've installed and then this guy
continue<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> work<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.060> better

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
continue to work to get better
