00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello and welcome to our nearly so 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.960
 today we will talk about the background 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.900
 mousseron or marasme of the orades or 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.570
 gaiter button or gendarmes buttons 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.949
 so it's a little mushroom that's 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.910
 rather cream with a little nipples that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.769
 is darker than the rest of the hat 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.109
 it is cut at the base and that's what the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.570
 worse seems so it's a little foot that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.670
 and fibrous and its characteristic that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 not to be wrong is that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.489
 we go back the foot does not break 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's not a fibrous foot but see 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 elastic in every way 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.809
 once we have turned the hat over 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 characteristic is that the slats 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 alternates large slats and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.960
 small hamel large small slats 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 wide strips the beautiful little my mother 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.409
 here is a mushroom in the cellar 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 which one eats only the hat the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.110
 foot can recognize it but we do not 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 do not eat so we cut 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 it's a mushroom that in general and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.090
 it's at the dried sow dehydrator either 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.470
 in a crate with a little bit of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 diary some people also 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 pick up only the hat and pass 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 the hat with a needle and a son 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 and make garlands made of steam 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.790
 mushrooms to dry them on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 eat them in the gossip 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.549
 in sauces but also in 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 terrines it's a mushroom 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 relatively unknown but very tasty 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.960
 is then very very common it is 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.869
 mainly found after a rain 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.969
 so when it rained a better day 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.409
 it's from 24 to 48 hours 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.570
 went to the meadows since 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 found in meadows more often in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.600
 cow prices but you find it 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.600
 also in your turf 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 it grows like roses and a round 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.810
 witches and actually it takes 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.430
 a lot to fill a basket but 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.349
 it's a mushroom that has a lot of 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.930
 gouges court show again here and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.340
 we only eat the hat and when we 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.440
 find one or two actually 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.360
 follows the witches rhÃ´ne and in general one 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.959
 pick up a good twenty so 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:41.620
 marasmus of the orades or false mousseron or 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.620
 or flip flops be thank you soon goodbye
