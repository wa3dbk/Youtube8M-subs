money getting the traps done again as
thats<00:03:04.160> think<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.240> defense<00:03:05.600> as<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.840> can<00:03:06.050> my

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
thats think of the defense as we can my

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.770 
thats think of the defense as we can my
defense<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.459> left<00:03:07.700> side<00:03:07.880> is<00:03:08.240> much<00:03:08.540> tougher

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
defense on the left side is much tougher

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.330 
defense on the left side is much tougher
than<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.350> on<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.590> right<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:10.100> way<00:03:10.250> i<00:03:10.280> can

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
than the one on the right that way i can

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.310 
than the one on the right that way i can
spend<00:03:10.700> more<00:03:10.820> time<00:03:11.000> focused<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.780> only<00:03:11.990> one

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
spend more time focused on only one

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.199 
spend more time focused on only one
aspect<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.920> my<00:03:13.130> defense<00:03:13.550> which<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.090> right

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
aspect of my defense which is the right

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.810 
aspect of my defense which is the right
hand<00:03:14.420> side<00:03:14.510> rather<00:03:14.870> than<00:03:15.050> both<00:03:15.490> but<00:03:16.490> like<00:03:16.700> i

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
hand side rather than both but like i

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.010 
hand side rather than both but like i
said<00:03:16.850> before<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.360> need<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.540> keep<00:03:17.690> an<00:03:17.810> eye<00:03:17.900> on

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
said before you need to keep an eye on

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.560 
said before you need to keep an eye on
both<00:03:18.230> sides<00:03:18.730> mostly<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.239> use<00:03:20.300> your

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
both sides mostly you can just use your

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.300 
both sides mostly you can just use your
radar<00:03:20.930> if<00:03:21.050> you<00:03:21.170> see<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> red<00:03:21.620> dot<00:03:21.800> slip<00:03:22.100> past

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
radar if you see a red dot slip past

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.340 
radar if you see a red dot slip past
where<00:03:22.580> you<00:03:22.700> know<00:03:22.820> your<00:03:22.970> traps<00:03:23.239> are<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.140> go

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
where you know your traps are then go

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.199 
where you know your traps are then go
