00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
maps with Cove there's a lot of pine

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.000 
maps with Cove there's a lot of pine
pine<00:02:49.419> trees<00:02:49.719> I<00:02:49.840> said<00:02:50.109> this<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:50.349> my<00:02:50.469> original

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
pine trees I said this in my original

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.589 
pine trees I said this in my original
commentary<00:02:51.669> for<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.939> math<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.329> don't<00:02:52.540> know

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
commentary for this math to I don't know

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.599 
commentary for this math to I don't know
why<00:02:52.719> I<00:02:52.750> keep<00:02:52.930> saying<00:02:53.139> pine<00:02:53.439> trees<00:02:53.709> palm<00:02:54.579> trees

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
why I keep saying pine trees palm trees

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.179 
why I keep saying pine trees palm trees
on<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.780> map<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.379> they<00:02:56.500> actually<00:02:56.530> block

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
on this map and they actually block

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.119 
on this map and they actually block
lodestar<00:02:57.909> missiles<00:02:58.359> and<00:02:58.569> so<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.500> lodestar<00:03:00.010> is

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
lodestar missiles and so the lodestar is

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.270 
lodestar missiles and so the lodestar is
not<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.760> very<00:03:01.180> good<00:03:01.299> option<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.799> play<00:03:03.069> well

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
not a very good option you can play well

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.909 
not a very good option you can play well
with<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.639> I<00:03:03.879> just<00:03:04.540> didn't<00:03:04.870> really<00:03:04.989> enjoy<00:03:05.469> it

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
with it I just didn't really enjoy it

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.649 
with it I just didn't really enjoy it
and<00:03:06.069> plus<00:03:06.519> i<00:03:06.639> like<00:03:06.819> to<00:03:06.939> use<00:03:07.000> skill<00:03:07.389> streets

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
and plus i like to use skill streets

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.149 
and plus i like to use skill streets
that<00:03:07.870> allow<00:03:08.109> me<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.349> keep<00:03:08.530> running<00:03:08.829> around<00:03:09.069> the

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
that allow me to keep running around the

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.670 
that allow me to keep running around the
map<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.060> i<00:03:10.090> did<00:03:10.540> use<00:03:10.689> warthog<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:11.169> as<00:03:11.409> you<00:03:11.530> see

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
map so i did use warthog and as you see

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.080 
map so i did use warthog and as you see
here<00:03:11.889> it<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.010> going<00:03:12.400> off<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.549> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.969> on

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
here it is going off a little bit on

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.089 
here it is going off a little bit on
this<00:03:13.269> map<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.139> Warhawk<00:03:14.439> is<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> very<00:03:14.889> good

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
this map so the Warhawk is a very good

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.520 
this map so the Warhawk is a very good
option<00:03:15.280> i've<00:03:16.000> also<00:03:16.209> used<00:03:16.359> escort<00:03:17.049> drone<00:03:17.290> and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
option i've also used escort drone and

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.770 
option i've also used escort drone and
that's<00:03:17.949> a<00:03:18.069> great<00:03:18.220> option<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.699> well<00:03:18.729> but<00:03:19.720> i

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
that's a great option as well but i

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.420 
that's a great option as well but i
would<00:03:19.959> stay<00:03:20.169> away<00:03:20.229> from<00:03:20.349> lodestar<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
would stay away from lodestar and I

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.069 
would stay away from lodestar and I
would<00:03:21.549> stay<00:03:21.759> away<00:03:21.849> from<00:03:21.970> dogs<00:03:22.389> only<00:03:22.930> because

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
would stay away from dogs only because

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.099 
would stay away from dogs only because
the<00:03:23.919> dogs<00:03:24.189> end<00:03:24.519> up<00:03:24.669> when<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.419> spawns<00:03:25.689> flip

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
the dogs end up when the spawns flip

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.349 
the dogs end up when the spawns flip
just<00:03:26.769> running<00:03:27.099> back<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.549> forth<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.120> map

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
just running back and forth on the map

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.210 
just running back and forth on the map
and<00:03:28.659> they<00:03:29.139> they<00:03:29.500> kind<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.739> can't<00:03:29.949> make<00:03:30.099> up

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and they they kind of can't make up

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.110 
and they they kind of can't make up
their<00:03:30.250> minds<00:03:30.519> where<00:03:30.729> they<00:03:30.819> want<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.060> go

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
their minds where they want to go

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.059 
their minds where they want to go
because<00:03:31.329> people<00:03:31.750> are<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:31.989> dying<00:03:32.259> so<00:03:32.650> quickly

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
because people are just dying so quickly

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.550 
because people are just dying so quickly
and<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:34.449> just<00:03:34.659> doesn't<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:34.930> work<00:03:35.229> out<00:03:35.379> as

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
and it just doesn't really work out as

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.499 
and it just doesn't really work out as
well<00:03:35.590> as<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:36.040> would<00:03:36.159> think<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:36.790> didn't

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:37.509 
well as you would think so I didn't

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.360 
well as you would think so I didn't
really<00:03:37.540> enjoy<00:03:37.840> dogs<00:03:38.259> on<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:38.590> map<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:39.040> didn't

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
really enjoy dogs on this map I didn't

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.879 
really enjoy dogs on this map I didn't
enjoy<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.729> lodestar<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.509> would<00:03:41.169> recommend<00:03:41.470> if

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
enjoy the lodestar I would recommend if

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.490 
enjoy the lodestar I would recommend if
