 one or another romantic theme to move 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.829
 the raisins for me is the music that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 should join us abolish classism and 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.700
 discrimination by race if the change

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 the state plays with blind justice 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 that in the constitution comes action for 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.849
 the dishes are not there but let me tell you 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.590

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.900
 that they sell in movie theaters poverty is in the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.000
 head because there is no for pasta but yes 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.190
 to spend on cigar and liquor they ask 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.989
 It is necessary that the priority is to educate 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.239

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.700

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.890
 money is not eaten and the neighborhood is not 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.260
