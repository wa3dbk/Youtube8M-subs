 really cool game try it yourself because 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.179
 free registration game passes two 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.130
 mouse clicks from registration windows description 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.609
 under the video, well, I ran to deliver their 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 firms 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.130
 hello friends with you woody welcome 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.539
 to the clicker programmer and even 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 don't click guys call the keyboard 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 drummer programmer this is so why 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.149
 because you are going to be here for 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.309
 click the mouse and we will click on 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.930
 the keyboard naturally we will 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.559
 programming start writing code with us 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.730
 programming language 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 replied by the answers do not know about this 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 thing i don't know no dating language 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 absolutely still for every 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 traveled a job well done after all 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.039
 we need to completely fill the Nukaba 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.690
 the slider is completely on the plan then its 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.370
 keystrokes 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.899
 that is, roughly time to write code when we 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 write it to the end we get 2 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.350
 dollars for each code writing 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.449
 gritty written code natural a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.080
 bye as you can see i have one 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.590
 programmer 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 for which kia writes this week and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.119
 the maximum would be two out of 300 I 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 I can find before the programmer to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.110
 help me wrote code shone and not 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 I'll still press all the code on the sly 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.360
 themselves as it were supplemented means that to me 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.009
 helps programmers to write all the code but 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 nevertheless I can donate 5 dollars 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.700
 learn a new programming language 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.799
 python and accordingly for him I will 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 more money the area well, he field 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.939
 payback let's say so can 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.939
 be on the afternoon another programmer 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 but money can't fifteen dollars 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.159
 we are worth 1 besides i can still to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.909
 see take a new 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.090
 specialization for example i can 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.149
 develop a pure website and websites 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 but to take this specialization was 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 you need 500 bucks just to spend and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.360
 respectively take the edge 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 specialization i need to learn pawns 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.640
 and I have a maximum sheet in work to 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.740
 will be like 10 i mean i can instead 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.750
 two run 110 as a programmer 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.519
 which will not just help well 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.470
 Let's be good to write code because 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.030
 that it is very important quite if you will 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.680
 press on not the same keys go away 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.709
 write slowly because you need to press 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.930
 different keys can be faster and just 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.269
 I have a microphone near the keyboard 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 so I do not really think it is convenient and all for 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.610
 you can see immediately that I click 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.739
 pretty so don't pony 15 bucks what 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.599
 I need to study new there 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.349
 language or like no idea now 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.130
 look and python 15 peshkesh 150 dollars 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.200
 and a new programmer to hire minutes 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.290
 15 bucks 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.959
 thinking 25 or let's click on 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.780
 programmer and would not have let on 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.430
 him a new programmer 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.010
 in this language the discovery is much faster 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.730
 went progress much faster because 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.579
 that i have two language programs 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.349
 hooked pad dont even know naturally with 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.349
 such a success does not stick very long 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.569
 for a long time only esha to knock to really 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.200
 something to go further where to study 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.140
 new language 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.840
 ioshpe there goes on python python helped 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.700
 I need and do not need a pet to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 make more money because two 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.400
 times the salary of money is of course general 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.000
 not exit the Mongols I need 23 bucks 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.099
 to get 25 bucks i need more 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.319
 20 bucks is not enough then I need 10 times 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.989
 to push filled to the end and 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.680
 then i will get what i want case then 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:38.620
 what do I want derek well here guys okay 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.989
 nevertheless we will pull out my stats i can 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.400
 delete and start over it's full 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.769
 Kick I think I will not do this already 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.870
 not passionately understood this scale completely and 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.709
 it is in my opinion a complete sadness trouble because 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.319
 what oh just don't hang up please don't 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.819
 god bless you after 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.379
 hard for the programmer to live you 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.530
 just look how many times you had to 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.840
 beat the keys to finally the same 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.220
 there is in it if you value work 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.419
 programmer to read and what are you really 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.609
 cool place huskies 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.760
 100 types thumbs up support 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.639
 programmer everyone and everything because they are real 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.799
 cool dudes with people just awful in this 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.630
 all code to understand and in general 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.579
 add this move a hundred times a day 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.280
 and if there for example a site to someone 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.560
 created and someone this corner will delete 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 all damn nafig tears they have to again 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.860
 consist even just pipets what I and 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.900
 So I understand dude ort at all it 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.990
 cool actually create sites this 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.570
 ki program is cool to actually create 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.130
 here nothing there apostle and tried 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.710
 I myself know programming 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.080
 how difficult it actually is 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.080
 of course depends on the language and in general 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.669
 persistence and so on but nonetheless she 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.490
 not as easy as some can 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.520
 seem but nevertheless so far 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.010
 we scratched ourselves in tongues so 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.889
 plucked over bucks that almost 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.360
 enough to buy god 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.629
 need perry for another 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.139
 shorter than the other hand to start a treasure 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.639
 click no click click hollow 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.120
 on the clave need the other hand because 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.340
 left already tired to listen and on principle 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.680
 everything is logical because the usual work 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.719
 I am right hand more precisely the right left 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.569
 left finger index finger right 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.550
 recognized hands will need well and it will be 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.409
 often click on native leaders but 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.849
 no less now i'm fully occupied 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.099
 left hand shoulder all fingers 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.460
 accordingly what is needed carefully 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:41.219
 fill the year and and principle we need 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.009
 that more was clave percussion clickers 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.759
 to pump your left hand guys 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.069
 not only right 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.439
 not even the right right finger and 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.930
 so it connects at least as well 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.789
 Well its programmer let's 25 bucks it 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.770
 just living a quality game and knowing 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.990
 who visit hollows how many pancake on this 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.120
 keys i don't know such people though no i 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:06.840
 thinks a lot well what are we studying capiton 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.550
 this language and now I will be 5 bucks 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.009
 receive for each stage passed 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.139
 great just guys and yes it's cool 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.560
 actually 5 bucks will get 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.330
 now look i need how many times 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.300
 I need to drink to protect about 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.639
 150 eat need 10 times as a dick from the evening 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.159
 30 times you need to fill the scale to 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.020
 learn pawns and only when you 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.029
 learn pawns i can become 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.789
 website developer they need again 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:38.939
 500 very bucks for together 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.390
 she dime I can now these pawns 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.820
 I can't hire 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.910
 because I am the best I can on it yet 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:51.500
 between their dudes they are all working on 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.800
 patch that is, they work on php or 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.440
 work jobs like country 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.060
 they always crossed pythons I got it in 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.740
 Generally anyway they can not 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.730
 additional specialists because 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.160
 he is my limit 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.870
 population two dudes and there is also just 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.600
 really means guys 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.390
 cool clicker basically cool 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.060
 can occur can and cannot be 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.890
 principle cool clicks really 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.260
 but the author needs to be very close to think about 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.320
 how much is needed chekkarini against to 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.540
 win or just unreal water it 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.320
 need to speed up hard how much he 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.720
