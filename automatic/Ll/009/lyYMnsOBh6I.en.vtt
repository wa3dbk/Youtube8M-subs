now<00:03:17.940> does<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:18.970> very<00:03:19.299> strange<00:03:19.660> thing<00:03:19.750> it

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
now does a very strange thing it

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.350 
now does a very strange thing it
switches<00:03:20.380> your<00:03:20.650> arms<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.130> legs<00:03:21.400> imagine<00:03:22.329> that

switches your arms and legs imagine that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.600 
switches your arms and legs imagine that
when<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.690> moved<00:03:22.900> your<00:03:23.019> physical<00:03:23.470> arms<00:03:23.769> your

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
when you moved your physical arms your

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.340 
when you moved your physical arms your
virtual<00:03:25.030> legs<00:03:25.239> moved<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.690> then<00:03:26.110> when<00:03:26.260> you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
virtual legs moved and then when you

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.380 
virtual legs moved and then when you
moved<00:03:26.560> your<00:03:26.680> physical<00:03:27.160> legs<00:03:27.400> your<00:03:27.970> virtual

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
moved your physical legs your virtual

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.630 
moved your physical legs your virtual
arms<00:03:28.720> moved<00:03:28.930> what<00:03:29.680> would<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:29.920> be<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.130> and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
arms moved what would that be like and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.300 
arms moved what would that be like and
this<00:03:30.820> is<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.030> study<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.600> asks<00:03:32.230> how<00:03:32.739> long<00:03:33.100> it

where you're your virtual body can do

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.660 
where you're your virtual body can do
things<00:03:37.840> your<00:03:37.930> physical<00:03:38.290> one<00:03:38.410> can't<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.549> of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
helps you motion capture as well as

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.860 
helps you motion capture as well as
optical<00:04:30.610> sensors<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.180> inertial<00:04:31.540> sensors
