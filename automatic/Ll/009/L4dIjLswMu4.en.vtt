00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.000
 I noticed 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 No one quotes Shakespeare or yells Nom Hangshki today. 

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:12.287
 I didn't see the professor. 

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:16.400
 There is no doubt that he is deeply in a deep pain and masturbation 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.440
 Maybe just drunk in the underground bar 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.290
 No, he is here 

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.293
 Maybe 

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:25.257
 Welcome, people companion 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.840
 As always, I am super dissatisfied in this imprisonment. 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.760
 it is good 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.000
 Oops, Professor, you are not like yourself today. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.949
 I hope everything is well. 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.320
 I am fine, just a little cold 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.379
 Strong observation 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.704
 You are not a professor 

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:46.240
 Of course I am 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.685
 I am MasterCard. 

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:50.180
 Intellectuals and abalone 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.617
 He qualified 

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.051
 Thank you 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.420
 That's really a bad cold. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.700
 He also got a super fever 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.360
 Translation / Timeline: Base Christmas 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.020
 Hoff, this is definitely not a professor. 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.940
 Where did he go? 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.480
 I thought I could confuse you. 

00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.541
 You underestimate our IQ 

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:11.671
 jailer 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.020
 Obviously the professor is the smartest of you. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.281
 Fully reasonable 

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:18.217
 In short, where is he? 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.860
 He was taken to another zoo 

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:23.024
 What? why 

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:27.960
 I still remember that day, the champion Valve appeared and disappeared. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.000
 Then the same day I fainted magically 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.120
 You make me face when I faint 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.860
 Why use the word Dork? 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 That is my father's name. 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.428
 At least she didn't call you Little Dork. 

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:48.575
 My dad is very mean and irritable. 

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.318
 I am the exact opposite 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.020
 He never understood that I was more suitable to manage the zoo breeding department. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.155
 Nurturing? 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.200
 Look at me, dad, chief administrator 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.260
 Dad's problem is interstellar 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.020
 My dad is always wearing a high waist pants 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.660
 My dad barely wears pants. 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.020
 Casually, Rita, I think you are lying about everything. 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.980
 At least I never knew that I was really dad. 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.440
 I am an illegitimate child, a slave who is sold. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 There is a man training my fighting skills 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 At the time, I used it as my true father. 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.060
 Until he sent me to grow coffee beans abroad, he was piped by a man with eyes on his forehead. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.040
 Primus is the focus 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.100
 What is good to send away the professor? 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.440
 Usually we will receive another stupid human 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.900
 Or a batch of sandpaper in your toilet 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.260
 sandpaper? You mean toilet paper 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.115
 I do not think so 

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:47.634
 God, hope so 

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.561
 To shut up 

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.140
 I sent him to warn you. 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.050
 Don't mention my dad 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.199
 Hoff, I am sorry. 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.763
 Sorry for your guilt 

00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:57.864
 But professor, he is our friend 

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:02.060
 This is why I use robots to soothe your emotions. 

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.297
 My brain is bigger than you 

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:05.649
 I am a professor 

00:03:05.694 --> 00:03:07.694
 Hoff, have you considered his psychological condition? 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.620
 You killed the newcomer last week because he said that the porridge is too salty. 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.440
 My slim hand is very sensitive, you know 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.580
 That robot can't fool anyone. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.031
 When will the professor come back? 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.120
 I want to say a wise excuse 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.672
 I really enjoy it. 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.160
 To teach back 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.116
 Is the robot recording? 

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.041
 He is a spy 

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.893
 I know 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.040
 Detective identity 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.180
 Just like the teeth are raining 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.756
 He may be a spy 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.780
 I don't believe you after you doodle my face. 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.240
 There was a strange thing happening with Valve that day. 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.900
 That is why the professor is not here. 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.560
 Dad, are you happy? is it? 

00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:02.571
 The professor is gone 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.860
 Maybe the clip is the best way to miss him. 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.480
 What is a clip (montage), Ajie? 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.628
 Let me explain 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 Is it reasonable? 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.700
 The montage looks like the last thing that can be done for the professor. 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.127
 Maybe we should 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.060
 Itâ€™s really awkward 

00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:37.621
 I will miss him. 

00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.257
 I havenâ€™t said goodbye to him yet. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.520
 His sexual experience... 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.180
 Maybe we should go to the bar to drink 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.523
 I hope he is okay. 

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:49.580
 Let us hope that this cruel universe will pity him. 

00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.537
 Dear Professor 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.500
 Do you like our perfect chest female area? 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.122
 of course 

00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:00.285
 Do you miss old friends? 

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.329
 I don't think about them. 

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:07.820
 I feel like I have a part left there.
