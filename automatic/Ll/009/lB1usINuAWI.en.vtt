Chung Lou and I think that you know not

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.490 
Chung Lou and I think that you know not
only<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.109> this<00:02:46.200> an<00:02:46.410> opportunity<00:02:47.250> for<00:02:47.930> him<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
only is this an opportunity for him to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
have this vision and to tell the story

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.509 
have this vision and to tell the story
but<00:02:51.840> also<00:02:52.019> for<00:02:52.470> him<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.769> bring<00:02:52.920> back<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.400> know

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
but also for him to bring back you know

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.509 
but also for him to bring back you know
a<00:02:53.900> sense<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.989> storytelling<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.769> he<00:02:56.129> has

East<00:03:05.250> Asia<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.940> think<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.599> know<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.109> an

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
East Asia I think you know it's it's an

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.530 
East Asia I think you know it's it's an
opportunity<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.069> only<00:03:08.129> for<00:03:08.400> him<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.000> also

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
