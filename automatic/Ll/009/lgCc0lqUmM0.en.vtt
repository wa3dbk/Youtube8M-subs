00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.390
 in the reality 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.630
 it is our duty 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.120
 deny the obvious state of drunkenness and aduriz 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.890

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.309

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.590
 Peter is to say that also as I said at the time 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.870
 there were five votes difference between the last and the penultimate place we are 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.870
 how many minutes nor massacres nor less German and by the way 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.130
 the whole family told me something like 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.620
 If we go to any relationship, we will have it 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.659
 It does not depend on her from this and yes I will not love you 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.070

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.390

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.679

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.679
 at the time 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.659
 those last three places are formed 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.239
 by three people 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.349
 of which you can only see in that none 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.109

 is where I was going to adapt the song today 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.549
 read the dog that is here and that you are going to see at this moment that is 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.659

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.749
 And if you remember astonished mature does not like the song and without more 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.739
 remember well he had a lot of problems with his song during the week and if wrong 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.889
 I do not remember in the past week Miguel Angel took a scolding for his 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.769
 interpretation and this time has to give 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.019
 more than last week 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.039
 and in general the preparation of the concert 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.209
 is 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.239

 granada by agustín lara for example 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.839
 it's clear to me that that's what it is 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:12.289
 see box that in less than 200 votes between the two 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.979
 I also remind you that between the last and the penultimate place in this 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.919
 There is no more than five votes 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.549
 I remember them too 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.890
 that there is no more than a minute of call difference between that its 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.400
 places makes you see the students are behind the video goal there when alan 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.249

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.729
 it remains more than telling them 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.159
