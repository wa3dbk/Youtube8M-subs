00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.740
 from juventus de and here with the lenovo 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.030
 650 smartphone at the same time 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.889
 technical data 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.240
 You see, that's not too big for us 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.430
 have a 4.7 inch qhd display here 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.550
 a quad-core processor 1.3 gigahertz 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 that would have to be a mediatex is now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 not and none of the staff wanted 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 answer that to me now 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 we have a relatively young design here 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.909
 with 8 7 millimeters and weighs 126 grams 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.250
 Of course we have two cameras installed 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.519
 0.3 megapixel front just for 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.449
 real snapshots and for 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.430
 Video calling and on the back 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.129
 an 8 megapixel camera with led light 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 as an operating system android 4.2 jelly 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 bean with its own user interface so you 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.909
 Do you also see that we just go to one 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 height widgets homescreen and also 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.470
 i have the apps i am really very 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.610
 practically you have to go somewhere 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.920
 Press to go down 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.380
 of course have folders but the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.140
 Most apps are then on this 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 and by design, it's really here 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.890
 with such a laser laser as the back 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 very seriously and feels very soft 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.590
 I like that here 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 frame so in the context of drum 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.609
 volume buttons here a power side 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.859
 button here still a headphone connection 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.770
 and a micro usb port here on the 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.090
 bottom keeps up quite well too 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.459
 nice and fast and has a starting price of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.329
 229 us dollars for europe probably 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.539
 then 229 euros and will end of the month 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.030
 so come on the market in january 2010 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.899
 I'm not sure if that's the case now 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.890
 but the state for europe is at least 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.429
 for the usa 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.819
