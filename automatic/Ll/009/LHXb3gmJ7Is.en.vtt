00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
serious nature of the fast inside of all

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.899 
serious nature of the fast inside of all
of<00:01:06.520> us<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:12.190> as<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.430> see<00:01:12.610> we<00:01:12.760> have<00:01:12.790> three

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
of us so as you see we have three

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.750 
of us so as you see we have three
objects<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.659> table<00:01:14.020> here<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:15.159> want<00:01:15.670> you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
objects on the table here and I want you

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.250 
objects on the table here and I want you
to<00:01:16.260> indicate<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.620> me<00:01:17.770> by<00:01:18.760> pointing<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.600> by

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
to indicate to me by pointing and by

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.360 
to indicate to me by pointing and by
words<00:01:20.620> speaking<00:01:21.510> which<00:01:22.510> of<00:01:22.780> these<00:01:23.160> evokes<00:01:24.160> the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
words speaking which of these evokes the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.480 
words speaking which of these evokes the
idea<00:01:24.400> of<00:01:24.760> fast<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.960> you<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.560> most<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:27.220> these

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
idea of fast to you the most of these

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.570 
idea of fast to you the most of these
things<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:29.170> guess<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:29.620> would<00:01:29.710> say<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.950> Hat<00:01:30.190> I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
things I guess I would say the Hat I

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.050 
things I guess I would say the Hat I
didn't<00:01:31.300> notice<00:01:31.420> like<00:01:31.690> when<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.590> am<00:01:32.770> I'm<00:01:33.550> driving

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
didn't notice like when I am I'm driving

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.120 
didn't notice like when I am I'm driving
and<00:01:34.180> then<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.360> windows<00:01:34.630> down<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.380> going

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
and then the windows down and going

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.340 
and then the windows down and going
really<00:01:36.250> fast<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.090> gets<00:01:37.240> really<00:01:37.360> cold<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.290> I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
really fast it gets really cold and I

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.810 
really fast it gets really cold and I
