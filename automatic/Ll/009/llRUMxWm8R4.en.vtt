00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 hello dear people welcome to the first 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 part of this sushi online course and me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.260
 I thought today show the very first 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.859
 Names how to properly cook sushi rice 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.439
 and then in the following videos would be 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.150
 you see many variations and me 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 Hope you like it and continue to Ireland 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.090
 turn and catch most directly times 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.510
 so i had sushi rice here you see 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 here once and I want 300 here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 gram for the last time 400 grams for two 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.489
 Persons work does not seem to eat 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 300 is now too 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 this is a good solution for me as the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 then here are once 300 grams and me 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have a clear water here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 cold clear water i shows that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 once the water is clear now 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 relatively clear is a bit and 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 he goes and gets the stimulus through and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 you see is water turbid you see 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.310
 that and that 's important for us 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.310
 leave everything nice 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.549
 I like most about 45 times the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.880
 Water is pretty clear that's better 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.500
 for the price and the cravings 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 Now the package is what we here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.009
 With many can be excellently unboxing video 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 on 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.490
 since they also recommend at least three 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 wash it and I want that one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 a few times through her you see that you are calm 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.299
 then we would already have many 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 Dirt had 678 times 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.790
 wash there not said yet 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.439
 Wash several times 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.149
 you look like clear water here 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.100
 has been washed four times and so on 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.500
 Should be his name once with the rice 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 and then give it pot then I have 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.670
 Now the pot and I give the rice 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 enter here on the spot 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.369
 15 times the amount of water to all 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.079
 300 grams I had then goes 450 now 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.960
 program promotions water is best 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.280
 Today I'm going to say that exactly 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.600
 always pay a reason because that's more accurate 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.399
 is pay as a tenant 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.200
 so we have that here now we enter 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.550
 once the rice on the stove and on the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 height 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.320
 So heat up your whole bowl and 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.960
 once the cooking chef team 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.970
 turn down edius stage and 20 minutes 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.720
 let it swell and over again 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.300
 carry out 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.260
 not about tackling what is on the ground and 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.180
 We do not have to do more now 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.830
 do and do not salt here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 purely because we give the same yet 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.120
 The spices also rice if he cares 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.720
 but I will tell you then if it is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.970
 is done 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.120
 while traveling now always cooks 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.420
 and put some sugar in a bowl 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.610
 and I give a tablespoon of sugar 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.120
 in addition it is the painted one 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.720
 tablespoon and we are still acting 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.760
 salt and a teaspoon of salt 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.440
 do not forget the recipe is for two 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.940
 People if the movie if the stop 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.150
 weather conditions make for four people 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.840
 Of course, she also wants to adapt 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 and then we go sushi less 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.750
 So sushi yourself and go away 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.190
 we have three tablespoons of it here 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.820
 which is definitely in the set 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.590
 contain 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.020
 and all this just like that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.709
 let stand confused standing 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.020
 until the sugar has dissolved and on 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.750
 best does like that about 10 15 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.340
 minutes before the rice is ready 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.830
 there would be enough time to dissolve 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.840
 but almost dissolving and that is 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.890
 then have our cutback for the price 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.470
 I now cooked here rice 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.750
 lid was all the time on that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.690
 very important among rises here you see 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.120
 beautiful fluffy and I have one 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.209
 few times by being presented 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.010
 again with guido grandt abt and what 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.790
 Let's do it now we give here 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:07.840
 mix our vinegar sugar salt once 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:10.880
 everything booms and then 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.640
 mix this once optimally 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.810
 had I van gaal've got no and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.169
 I was not so often her or 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.550
 not so fast 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.830
 so I now just here the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.210
 made in the pot 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.060
 You can use a plastic bowl for that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.610
 take and so a fan to cool 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.660
 I already have diversified rises 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.030
 not that's why I take myself while 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.830
 some look stupid now but I do 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.250
 So that the baking paper and a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.440
 give baking tray travels to it 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.850
 cool spd directly around the corner with 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.340
 tripod curls up you see is 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.810
 but where I have that we only have 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.350
 so I give the same now on 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.550
 the balcony and terrace are in the house 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.610
 have and fill it out 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.540
 this is my fan method then but 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.960
 everything is a bit before 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.230
 flatter on the internet more surface is there 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.050
 already distributed is nice cool 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.530
 have done a long time he could again 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.300
 on the surface let it underneath 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.170
 work for what you need 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.610
 yes there is ambush in the bowl 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.280
 put over it and then you can even 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.860
 at least let stand 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.750
 and who would have thought that is not 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.370
 it's so hard to cook you have to 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.400
 a few things note that I have one 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.720
 video shown yes and if you want to 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.620
 have to imitate writing it in the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.060
