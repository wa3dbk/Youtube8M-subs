00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
it was a man I'm not kidding so by the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.540 
it was a man I'm not kidding so by the
third<00:03:01.140> application<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.410> thought<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.340> this

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
third application I thought that this

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.400 
third application I thought that this
mascara<00:03:04.090> would<00:03:04.360> make<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.720> even<00:03:04.959> better<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
mascara would make it even better and I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.949 
mascara would make it even better and I
would<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.709> more<00:03:05.890> volume<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:07.030> did<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.780> was

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
would have more volume it did it it was

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.880 
would have more volume it did it it was
just<00:03:08.170> making<00:03:09.010> them<00:03:09.280> look<00:03:09.520> all<00:03:09.700> spidery<00:03:10.450> and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
just making them look all spidery and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.009 
just making them look all spidery and
yucky<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:11.920> messy<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.420> was<00:03:13.540> starting<00:03:13.959> to

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
yucky and messy and it was starting to

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.920 
yucky and messy and it was starting to
weigh<00:03:14.290> down<00:03:14.320> my<00:03:14.830> eyelashes<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.790> that's<00:03:16.750> not

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
weigh down my eyelashes so that's not

how<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.959> actual<00:04:08.590> packaging<00:04:09.160> looks<00:04:09.489> like<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
how the actual packaging looks like and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.150 
how the actual packaging looks like and
it<00:04:10.540> just<00:04:10.600> comes<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.140> know<00:04:11.380> any<00:04:11.650> regular

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
it just comes like I know any regular

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.729 
it just comes like I know any regular
packaging<00:04:12.760> as<00:04:12.970> any<00:04:13.269> other<00:04:13.510> mascara<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.560> at<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
packaging as any other mascara so at the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.469 
packaging as any other mascara so at the
bottom<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.130> does<00:04:15.310> say<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.700> would<00:04:15.910> give<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.299> up

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
bottom it does say it would give you up

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.219 
bottom it does say it would give you up
to<00:04:16.720> 16<00:04:17.169> times<00:04:17.440> more<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:18.099> volume<00:04:18.760> which<00:04:19.419> for<00:04:20.049> me

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
to 16 times more of volume which for me

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.890 
to 16 times more of volume which for me
that<00:04:20.919> was<00:04:21.190> not<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.580> case<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.150> said

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
that was not the case like I said

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.140 
that was not the case like I said
and<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.259> how<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.440> actual<00:04:23.850> mascara<00:04:24.850> looks

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
and this is how the actual mascara looks

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.030 
and this is how the actual mascara looks
like<00:04:25.389> it's<00:04:25.660> super<00:04:26.080> cute<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.500> comes<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.830> pink

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
packaging with yellow lettering and now

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.550 
packaging with yellow lettering and now
for<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> brush<00:04:30.210> when<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.240> open<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.289> get

don't<00:04:39.789> like<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.330> personally<00:04:40.840> because<00:04:41.169> it's

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
don't like that personally because it's

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.260 
don't like that personally because it's
really<00:04:41.500> hard<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.860> get<00:04:42.009> in<00:04:42.130> my<00:04:42.310> actual<00:04:42.850> lashes
