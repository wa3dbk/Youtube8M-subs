if<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.570> case<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.170> me<00:00:28.320> thinking

if this is the case it got me thinking

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.759 
if this is the case it got me thinking
well<00:00:29.330> when<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> likely<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> Bautista

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
well when is it likely that Bautista

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.250 
well when is it likely that Bautista
will<00:00:31.949> return<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:33.420> sort<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.750> event<00:00:34.020> would

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
will return and what sort of event would

will return and what sort of event would
he<00:00:34.380> return<00:00:34.559> out<00:00:34.950> well<00:00:36.290> january-february

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
he return out well january-february

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
he return out well january-february
that's<00:00:37.680> raw<00:00:38.219> Rumble<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:40.050> would<00:00:40.350> be

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that's raw Rumble time so it would be

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
that's raw Rumble time so it would be
fitting<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:41.040> Bautista<00:00:41.489> made<00:00:41.969> his<00:00:42.149> return<00:00:42.360> at

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
fitting if Bautista made his return at

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
fitting if Bautista made his return at
the<00:00:43.110> Royal<00:00:43.410> Rumble<00:00:43.530> event<00:00:44.100> itself<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the Royal Rumble event itself and that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
the Royal Rumble event itself and that
would<00:00:45.840> make<00:00:45.989> sense<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.890> usually<00:00:47.100> have

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
would make sense because we usually have

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
would make sense because we usually have
big<00:00:47.789> name<00:00:48.000> surprises<00:00:48.690> big-name<00:00:49.110> participants

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
big name surprises big-name participants

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
big name surprises big-name participants
and<00:00:50.180> Batista<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> biggest

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and Batista would be one of the biggest

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
and Batista would be one of the biggest
if<00:00:52.649> he<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.309> hit<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> raw<00:00:53.850> Rumble<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
if he was to hit the raw Rumble this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.500 
if he was to hit the raw Rumble this
year<00:00:55.039> or<00:00:56.039> next<00:00:56.100> year<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> speak<00:00:57.620> 2014<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> if

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
year or next year so to speak 2014 so if

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.299 
year or next year so to speak 2014 so if
Bautista<00:01:00.840> did<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> Royal

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Bautista did come back at the Royal

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.210 
Bautista did come back at the Royal
Rumble<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.940> would<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> playing<00:01:03.899> out

Rumble how would I see it playing out
what<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.369> thinking<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> little

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
what I was thinking about this a little

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
what I was thinking about this a little
bit<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.689> came<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> scenario<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
bit and I came up with a scenario that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
bit and I came up with a scenario that
he<00:01:08.549> would<00:01:08.729> pick<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> feud<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.960> John<00:01:10.500> Cena<00:01:11.390> now

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
he would pick a feud with John Cena now

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
he would pick a feud with John Cena now
you're<00:01:12.540> probably<00:01:12.659> thinking<00:01:12.840> well<00:01:13.350> actually

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you're probably thinking well actually

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
you're probably thinking well actually
no<00:01:14.310> Cena<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.330> having<00:01:15.600> his<00:01:15.750> rematch<00:01:16.200> with

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
no Cena will be having his rematch with

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140

that's absolutely fine he can have his

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
that's absolutely fine he can have his
rematch<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.930> playing<00:01:22.170> out

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380

they<00:02:06.750> didn't<00:02:06.930> expect<00:02:07.259> Batista<00:02:07.710> return<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
they didn't expect Batista return and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.479 
they didn't expect Batista return and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
then Batista hits the ring and then

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.970 
then Batista hits the ring and then
sends<00:02:12.060> John<00:02:12.330> Cena<00:02:12.750> flying

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980

over<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.730> top<00:02:14.940> rope<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:16.370> we've<00:02:17.370> this

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
over the top rope now we've this

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.910 
over the top rope now we've this
happening<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.569> only<00:02:18.750> does<00:02:19.170> Batista

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
happening not only does Batista

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.550 
happening not only does Batista
eliminate<00:02:20.400> John<00:02:20.580> Cena<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.239> then<00:02:21.480> Batista<00:02:22.080> as

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
match himself he decides to duck out

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.190 
match himself he decides to duck out
over<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> top<00:02:28.560> rope<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.180> leave<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.629> match<00:02:30.840> as

over the top rope and leave the match as
well<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.849> would<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.269> added<00:02:33.660> insult

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
well now this would just be added insult

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.930 
well now this would just be added insult
to<00:02:34.140> injury<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.709> John<00:02:34.739> Cena<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.580> would<00:02:35.670> put

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
to injury to John Cena and it would put

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
to injury to John Cena and it would put
across<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.330> point<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.720> Bautista<00:02:37.230> didn't

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
across the point that Bautista didn't

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.949 
across the point that Bautista didn't
come<00:02:37.890> back<00:02:38.190> at<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.970> Royal<00:02:39.239> Rumble<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.780> win

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
come back at the Royal Rumble to win

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.740 
come back at the Royal Rumble to win
titles<00:02:40.530> he<00:02:40.950> came<00:02:41.220> back<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.760> screw<00:02:42.209> over<00:02:42.239> John

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
titles he came back to screw over John

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.440 
titles he came back to screw over John
Cena<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.890> would<00:02:44.129> reignite<00:02:44.640> their<00:02:45.120> feud

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
Cena and this would reignite their feud

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.170 
Cena and this would reignite their feud
because<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:46.739> back<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.610> Batista

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
because if you think back when Batista

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.960 
because if you think back when Batista
actually<00:02:48.569> left<00:02:48.810> he<00:02:49.049> was<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.739> big<00:02:50.310> feud<00:02:50.760> with

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
actually left he was in a big feud with

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.059 
actually left he was in a big feud with
John<00:02:51.209> Cena<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.870> time<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.440> potentially

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
John Cena at the time and potentially

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.819 
John Cena at the time and potentially
why<00:02:53.579> he<00:02:53.730> left<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.410> he<00:02:55.410> very<00:02:55.680> much

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
why he left was because he very much

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.069 
why he left was because he very much
dislike<00:02:56.129> John<00:02:56.609> Cena<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.390> would<00:02:57.750> be

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
dislike John Cena so this would be

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.610 
dislike John Cena so this would be
perfect<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.280> opinion<00:03:00.170> now<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.349> saw<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
perfect in my opinion now if I saw this

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.199 
perfect in my opinion now if I saw this
happening<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.489> would<00:03:02.700> build<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
happening then this would build to

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.839 
happening then this would build to
Wrestlemania<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.049> WrestleMania<00:03:04.560> 30<00:03:04.849> Batista

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
Wrestlemania and WrestleMania 30 Batista

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.080 
Wrestlemania and WrestleMania 30 Batista
would<00:03:06.120> face<00:03:06.390> John<00:03:06.690> Cena<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> think<00:03:08.549> story

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
would face John Cena so I think story

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.650 
would face John Cena so I think story
would<00:03:09.359> story<00:03:10.170> wise<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.799> storytelling<00:03:11.660> this

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
would story wise and storytelling this

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.740 
would story wise and storytelling this
would<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:12.989> perfect<00:03:13.519> but<00:03:14.519> other<00:03:15.269> matches<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
would be perfect but other matches that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690 
would be perfect but other matches that
could<00:03:16.049> potentially<00:03:16.170> happen<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:17.010> Bautista<00:03:17.280> if

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
could potentially happen for Bautista if

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.789 
could potentially happen for Bautista if
he<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.690> mix<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.139> go<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.349> Wrestlemania

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
he is in the mix to go to Wrestlemania

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.490 
he is in the mix to go to Wrestlemania
30<00:03:20.190> well<00:03:20.669> he<00:03:21.180> could<00:03:21.389> potentially<00:03:21.959> face<00:03:22.200> Lesnar

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
30 well he could potentially face Lesnar

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.720 
30 well he could potentially face Lesnar
so<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.340> could<00:03:23.489> see<00:03:23.639> batista<00:03:24.180> vs<00:03:24.540> brock<00:03:24.780> lesnar

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
so we could see batista vs brock lesnar

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.640 
so we could see batista vs brock lesnar
we<00:03:26.730> could<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> rematch<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.989> wrestlemania

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
we could see a rematch at wrestlemania

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.879 
we could see a rematch at wrestlemania
30<00:03:29.280> between<00:03:29.970> him<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.569> Undertaker<00:03:31.139> you

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
30 between him and the Undertaker you

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.050 
30 between him and the Undertaker you
know<00:03:32.040> they<00:03:32.220> had<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.370> good<00:03:32.579> match<00:03:32.819> at

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
know they had a good match at

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180 
know they had a good match at
WrestleMania<00:03:33.720> 23<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.590> could<00:03:34.859> very<00:03:34.889> well

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
WrestleMania 23 so that could very well

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.150 
WrestleMania 23 so that could very well
happen<00:03:35.519> or<00:03:36.480> even<00:03:37.200> Batista<00:03:37.739> could<00:03:37.919> go<00:03:38.099> up

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
happen or even Batista could go up

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920 
happen or even Batista could go up
against<00:03:38.519> one<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.940> younger<00:03:39.299> talents<00:03:39.720> maybe

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
against one of the younger talents maybe

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.580 
against one of the younger talents maybe
the<00:03:40.169> likes<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.530> Roman<00:03:41.069> reigns<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:42.380> would<00:03:43.380> see

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the likes of Roman reigns I would see

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.550 
the likes of Roman reigns I would see
that<00:03:43.739> happening<00:03:44.190> if<00:03:44.660> Roman<00:03:45.660> reigns<00:03:45.870> has<00:03:46.109> split

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
that happening if Roman reigns has split

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.280 
that happening if Roman reigns has split
from<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.829> shield<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.120> don't<00:03:48.660> think<00:03:48.989> that's

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
from the shield but I don't think that's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.280 
from the shield but I don't think that's
going<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> quite<00:03:49.889> happen<00:03:50.280> yet<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:52.079> there's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
going to quite happen yet so there's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.550 
going to quite happen yet so there's
some<00:03:52.500> scenarios<00:03:53.040> for<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.489> um<00:03:54.169> basically<00:03:55.169> guys
