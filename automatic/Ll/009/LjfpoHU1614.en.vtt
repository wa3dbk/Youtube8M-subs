00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:31.960
Why am I walking around in a place like this…?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:42.380
At this point, there’s no reason to keep asking myself.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.600
-I’m looking for a place to die.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:03.900
Here, I’m sure no one will find me,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:14.460
Deep within this forest everyone avoids.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.440
-But then why? Why is there someone else here?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
My my, aren’t you lost!

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:40.740
Why are you in a place like this?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:58.220
I’ll show you the way out, so please just follow me.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:17.900
And so, I followed her to a small cottage.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.320
I couldn’t just leave such an innocent girl behind.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.200
-Nor could I die by her side.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:54.900
“Let me bring you something to drink,” she said, and disappeared inside.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.360
Then I heard a something

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.160
Which piqued my curiosity

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.960
So I creaked open the door and peered inside

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.720
But what I saw…

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.620
-A large cauldron filled with poison.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.220
-Twisting things that looked like snakes.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.820
-Accursed tomes, inside

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.180
-A magic circle moving all on its own.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.800
But then wouldn’t that mean… This is a witch’s cottage!?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:00.680
Well didn’t that take you a while? And now you’ve stepped right into this evil witch’s home!

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.600
You’d think there’d be a limit to how stupid you can be!

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.920
Before I could react she was behind me, glowing with a dark light

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.620
From the smile she gave me, I knew for certain, this was a witch to be feared…

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.180
From her eyes, it looked as if she were sizing up her prey…

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.440
I tried to run away, but

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.120
…I can’t move!!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.680
Huh? Oh, it’s no use struggling.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.220
The moment you set foot in this forest,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.780
You were as good as dead. It’s the same for everyone.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.360
You didn’t see the skulls? Well, sometimes they don’t leave any bones-

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.920
…Anyway, the thing is, there’s no way anyone like you’d be able to escape!

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.000
-Now then.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.120
Shall we start the feast?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.300
-Hahaha.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.220
Why don’t you just offer yourself up for the table?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.560
If you’re going to have a feast you’ve got to go all the way!

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.460
It’s been a while since I’ve had anything this good stop by!

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.460
-Shall I tear off your fingernails?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.900
-Shall I drain your blood?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.200
-Shall I pluck out your tongue?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.700
-Shall I scoop out your eyes?

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.220
Curse your own stupidity!

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.040
Dance, why don’t you dance!? Hahaha!

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.420
The witch laughed savagely.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:23.080
Inside, all I could do was blame myself.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.460
Sing, why don’t you sing!? Hahaha!

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.760
The witch laughed savagely.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:36.820
I let out a whimper, “I don’t want to die…”

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.900
And there was a spiral of light

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.300
Releasing some sort of magic…

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.340
Is this how I’m going to meet my end?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.240
I closed my eyes

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.720
And turned away.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.820
“At least, don’t make it painful,” I pleaded…

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:17.520
-As I was saying. These sorts of things tend to happen to people like you…

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.640
So, you really should stay away from this forest.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:35.440
If you don’t – I really will eat you next time!!
