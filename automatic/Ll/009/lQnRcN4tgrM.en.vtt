00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 if maxime canteen mobile world congress 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 of Barcelona with a prototype of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 fujitsu phone would throw a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.240
 iris player so why in nectar 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.049
 iris 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.809
 actually if a security method of 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.240
 biometrics that allows to recognize in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 iris so what we see here so that's 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.850
 a real fujitsu phone 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 but with a module that has been glued and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.029
 which actually contains a camera 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.500
 infrared and a brace the space 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.690
 it helps to illuminate the world and risk 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 to take the picture so I wanted 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.290
 show in action 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.870
 firstly i'm going to save the mount 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 hery what are you being followed and everything 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.969
 what I learned yesterday about six 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.110
 meters for about 10 seconds to 20 cm 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.989
 about the phone 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 so we see and it's really fast in 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.960
 do like you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.820
 you can see it there 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.129
 it is much faster I by 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.770
 example % fingerprints for 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.700
 we start again from all angles 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.810
 is done 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.950
 it was very well resa 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.320
 move so it's a little less good but 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.550
 general rule and once that is 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
 done but to open 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.100
 I approach and it takes a second 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 not even so his phone is closed 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.150
 like that jealous 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.510
 I approach 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.630
 and here I am, so it works 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.180
 to close his phone 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.880
 open up to protect apps 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.369
 for example here the gallery not only 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.049
 prospective which is very fast which 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.549
 appears to me for the opening which 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.759
 seems to me as fast as the good ones 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.340
 fingerprint readers but 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.500
 recording fast game life 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 when if it's on a phone so 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.409
 it's clear that this is a device that will 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.969
 good for sure because the c1 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.950
 a device contains enough close to 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.479
 our face anyway so with a 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.009
 ATM machine something that is 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.659
 maybe less effective but like that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.630
 for a phone or computer 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.790
 it 's kind of rude kind of milliner 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.830
 could be interesting 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.420
 presently it's here it's big it's 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.820
 a prototype but you say does not want the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.590
 see in a real phone by the end 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.090
 of the year probably a phone 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 for Japan where another market of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.210
 kind of blaming ourselves but if he 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.280
 will arrive in thinner smaller and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.720
 great well integrated with the design of the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.210
 phone it's just we could 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.190
 possibly be really interesting 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.400
 passwords in fact that's where it's 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.950
 the achilles heel of security 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.960
 computer science and more we have biometrics 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.740
 like that and then what kind of things that 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.200
 will 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.540
 one to get rid of the words 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
 of pass so the dance is also I 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.220
 will know that it is of course that its 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.590
 roots 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.560
 I am told that it works 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.370
 false positives are less than 1 a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 once in a million 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.920
 So it's very reasonable for 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.660
 small if we search it impulse and be 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.640
 not perfect for example I could 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.459
 take a picture and a red of my 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.120
 eyes then print it out and use it 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.549
 to open here so these bodies that's 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.080
 maybe not 100% ideal but 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.549
 maybe something that Fujifilm 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.340
 will be able to fuck justice without 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.709
 pardon is going to be able to adjust the dc 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.349
 launch anyway we still it's 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.280
 to small and still a lot of time 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.470
 before you see that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.209
 arrived on the market especially with us 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.280
 because it's going to be in a phone 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.380
 in a computer in a box office 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
 automatic it remains to be seen but in 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.129
 all the cases I find that it's when 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.580
 even pretty interesting and for a 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:40.270
 prototype it works really well 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.270
 it was the fujitsu iris reader
