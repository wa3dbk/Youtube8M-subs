 hi sweets today one in art 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.630
 Christmas for short nails obviously 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.070
 you can also do it again on long nails 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.590
 and I thought of recreating a Santa Claus 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.980
 modern so it is not the classic father 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.530
 Christmas with a red cap but fashionable 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.690
 so with this purple two cap 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.210
 blue eyes ghini seems to me an idea 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.200

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.500

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.850

 make a base I used 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.590

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.450

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.640
