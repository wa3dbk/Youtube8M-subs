00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'll make red onion jam 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 onion jam and so onion slicing 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.519
 I use two kinds of jam 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:30.150
 This is a small cube and half rings 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.960
 today i will make jam with cuts 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.719
 half rings 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.250
 for making me jam today 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.129
 will need the bow directly myself 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 the most important ingredient 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 then honey any honey salt we add mascara 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.750
 all this will be in red wine dry 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 red wine and at the very end i will add 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.820
 a small touch of its highlight 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 this balsamic cream is ready 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 balsamic cream spread 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.330
 saucepan layered onion then sugar then 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330
 rub again 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.789
 and put on the stove 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.200
 add quite a bit of oil 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.200
 ordinary vegetable oil 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.380
 so 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 I'm starting to mix onions add more 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.830
 sugar 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.620
 look literally at 4 onions I 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.170
 added about 100 grams of sugar 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.090
 this amount is sufficient for the desired 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.510
 caramelization without adding more because 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.650
 what else will I add then honey 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.050
 it's time to add 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.930
 red wine now I'll add a little bit 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.210
 salt salt and adding onions because 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.280
 my jam will not be used 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.160
 only in the dessert part but also for 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.100
 cold snacks are when it boils 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 wine, it's time to add more honey 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.070
 a spoon and a little bit more 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.620
 balsamic cream portion 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.270
 balsamic cream 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.390
 I will add the second part to the end 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.340
 now add a sprig of thyme and wait 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.340
 until all the liquid boils out 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.420
 my jam has got such here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.490
 dark brown red color i delete 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.470
 twig so as not to forget thyme and 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.930
 add the last balsamic cream 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.890
 which remained for viscosity and for more 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:06.170
 dark elastic color I have prepared 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:19.970
 jar and start shifting the jam into 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 jar close the jar and put in 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.270
 convection oven 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.160
 if you don't have a convection oven at home 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.010
 use the usual traditional 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.010
 in the old proven way that is 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 put a dipper in boiling water or 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.530
 saucepan 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.830
 but be sure to put it underneath 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.980
 rag so that the bank does not burst 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.790
 enough 10 minutes I set 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.090
 temperature is 150 degrees and time is 10 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.090
 minutes 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.170
 so ten minutes passed my jam 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.370
 pasteurized and ready to eat 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.980
 when the jam gets cold 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.620
 it will take more elastic and thick 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.200
 consistency should be stored in 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.340
 the refrigerator and stored it for up to six months 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.340
 up to 6 months 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.349
 after all
