00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.620
 well maybe they are welcome in this 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.650
 spot light of what we talk about in the dark 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.960
 let's talk about a bike that adds the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.810
 mode adds the swords I'm talking about 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.550
 of morse ford mode a mod that already 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.430
 know why I talked about it in 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.619
 previously and showed me 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.190
 specifically this sword or the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.460
 admin arc but today you go again 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.449
 the mode of this mode and I'll do it 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.890
 see more or less these shoulders here and 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.479
 I do not mention this specifically or 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.219
 I'm not telling you how strong they are 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:44.649
 it exists as time kills and so on 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.239
 because that you can see it on 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.089
 minecraft forum 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.539
 and so we say risk of not being wrong 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.120
 and therefore to give you wrong information 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.659
 so let's start the fashion right away 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 several swords and several swords these 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.399
 you can find them all in a separate menu 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.899
 which makes it all easier because 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.049
 we don't have to go looking then 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.990
 be there item sum we have to click on 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.430
 this menu and all the swords come out 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.469
 of course everyone will be different 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.530
 on the other I have you in the last video 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.930
 talked to him I showed him to a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.000
 narco because it is the strongest because 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.430
 stronger because with just one click 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.189
 it kills anyone and then it's practically 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.170
 invincible that is to destroy 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.100
 this you have to kill billions billions 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.890
 of demonstrate because we also say from how 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.929
 si kraft you understand it signed with the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.780
 rock band and it's called own arc admin 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.140
 because we say about the servers that are 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.600
 fitted with this fashion and to a 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.429
 dwarf this sword and only the Armenians 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.880
 they can have it or the moderators 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.499
 however the eyes because it is 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.090
 precisely with the rock band the rock band is 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.810
 available only let's say in the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.329
 in the inventory of food a whose 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.979
 normal and can not find it is found in 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.280
 around but you ca n't 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.710
 destroy and therefore only the admin 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 but they can have it anyway 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.660
 several servers making contests 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880
 where challenges where 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.090
 however, weapons and things were won 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.330
 kind so be calm that you find it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.670
 even server is another thing 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.850
 I want to tell you is that I don't know what I have to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.310
 tell you oh God anyway there are swords that 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:36.280
 let's create say we form with con 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.960
 different items for example that is what 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.980
 kraft I call by bone texture 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.310
 through blades through in glass and so 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.860
 Street 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.620
 the avis la jolie as in this case e 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.240
 each one different from the other, however, like 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.210
 said before it has different characteristics 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.480
 on the other hand as mentioned in the last video is 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.910
 however, I will always tell you about the cad minar 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.810
 that the stronger and of course there 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.740
 I don't recommend using la creative 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.900
 even for a short time, however, I recommend 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.390
 take this team because anyway 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.050
 it is really very useful because with a 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.180
 just click 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.590
 let's say you'll kill any remains 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.770
 any monster we say the unity of 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.540
 time for hunting and so on 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.410
 for example in this case we say how many 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.880
 Oh God, what are they called? 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.610
 forgotten how many things there are 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.830
 Oh God, how many hours are there, you can kill 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.360
 in a very short time 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:46.420
 imagine if those say oh my God if 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.840
 this one has armor and does nothing 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.120
 if those for example were monsters 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.910
 we say you had stronger consistents than you 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.780
 cha cha killed and I will limit to 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.520
 get fucked and nothing I hope this 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.650
 ways like that this video is there 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.330
