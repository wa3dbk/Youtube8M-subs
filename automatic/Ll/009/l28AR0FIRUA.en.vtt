apparently<00:00:11.910> as<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.809> see<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.679> second

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130

hopefully<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> video<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.150> full<00:00:18.960> HD<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.859> very

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hopefully the video and full HD is very

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.710 
hopefully the video and full HD is very
sloppy<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> decided<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.789> additional

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
sloppy so I decided to make additional

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.009 
sloppy so I decided to make additional
tests<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.289> download<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> same

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
tests and download it to be is the same

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.490 
tests and download it to be is the same
in<00:00:28.260> different<00:00:28.609> quality<00:00:31.669> one<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
in different quality one of them is the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
in different quality one of them is the
full<00:00:34.739> HD<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:36.660> second<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:38.450> 720<00:00:39.450> let<00:00:39.600> me

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
full HD and the second one is 720 let me

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
full HD and the second one is 720 let me
show<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> second<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.250> new

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
show you in a second so this is the new

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
show you in a second so this is the new
trend<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.090> apparently<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.899> into<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
trend see this apparently if into it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.750 
trend see this apparently if into it
this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.640> 720<00:00:48.600> using<00:00:49.320> VLC<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.250> same<00:00:50.430> video

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
this is 720 using VLC the same video

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.490 
this is 720 using VLC the same video
just<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> second<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:54.629> works<00:00:54.930> smooth<00:00:57.500> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just in a second it works smooth the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.760 
just in a second it works smooth the
quite<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.980> costs<00:00:59.520> because<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.809> CPU<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
quite a bit costs because the CPU is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
quite a bit costs because the CPU is
about<00:01:03.860> forty<00:01:04.860> four<00:01:05.129> percent<00:01:07.850> fifty<00:01:08.850> percent

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
about forty four percent fifty percent

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.910 
about forty four percent fifty percent
now<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:10.049> see<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> sorry<00:01:11.430> unless<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.990> will

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.240 

go<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.310> system<00:01:17.820> monitor<00:01:18.860> there<00:01:19.860> might<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
go for system monitor there might be a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.790 
go for system monitor there might be a
bit<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.580> helpful

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240 

you<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.850> see<00:01:29.090> now<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.330> usage<00:01:30.250> it's

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you can see now the usage it's

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.770 
you can see now the usage it's
apparently<00:01:31.790> on<00:01:32.060> one<00:01:32.270> cpu<00:01:32.870> third<00:01:33.410> CTools<00:01:34.280> 45<00:01:35.150> 60

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
apparently on one cpu third CTools 45 60

apparently on one cpu third CTools 45 60
40<00:01:36.050> 80<00:01:36.470> 100<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.720> varies<00:01:39.430> varies<00:01:40.430> really

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
40 80 100 so the varies varies really

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.630 
40 80 100 so the varies varies really
various<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:41.810> with<00:01:42.020> went<00:01:42.230> absolutely<00:01:42.650> up<00:01:43.010> is

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
various now with went absolutely up is

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.880 
various now with went absolutely up is
it<00:01:43.940> is<00:01:44.060> he<00:01:44.210> up<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.390> ninety<00:01:44.900> percent<00:01:45.050> drop<00:01:45.470> down

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
it is he up to ninety percent drop down

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.680 
it is he up to ninety percent drop down
a<00:01:45.920> bit<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.170> 720<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.350> working<00:01:49.120> it's<00:01:50.120> enough<00:01:50.330> if

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
a bit so 720 is working it's enough if

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.780 
a bit so 720 is working it's enough if
you<00:01:50.870> want<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.290> watch<00:01:51.620> videos<00:01:52.160> but<00:01:52.340> it's<00:01:52.400> very

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
you want to watch videos but it's very
