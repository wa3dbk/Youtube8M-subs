going<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.810> another<00:01:37.259> thought<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.159> should

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
going for another thought like I should

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.580 
going for another thought like I should
have<00:01:38.880> predicted<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> soft-boiled<00:01:39.960> before

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
have predicted a soft-boiled before

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.399 
have predicted a soft-boiled before
going<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.040> into<00:01:41.220> hit<00:01:41.640> mantri<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.930> Hitman

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
going out into hit mantri the Hitman

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.850 
going out into hit mantri the Hitman
trios<00:01:43.890> long-lost<00:01:44.369> could<00:01:44.759> rule<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.990> should

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
trios long-lost could rule it I should

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.319 
trios long-lost could rule it I should
have<00:01:46.920> predicted<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> soft-boiled<00:01:47.850> before

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
have predicted a soft-boiled before

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.319 
have predicted a soft-boiled before
going<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.720> into<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:50.329> unfortunately

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329

off and so momentum on this thing not
give<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.650> chance<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.070> t<00:02:46.520> wave<00:02:46.730> something<00:02:47.060> not

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
give it a chance to t wave something not

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.420

know<00:02:49.520> just<00:02:49.670> keep<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> momentum<00:02:50.209> up<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.810> so

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
know just keep the momentum up on it so

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.530 
know just keep the momentum up on it so
he's<00:02:51.080> not<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.260> jerk<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.240> stalls<00:02:53.240> me<00:02:53.450> with

wants to set up and I still have a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.839 
wants to set up and I still have a
chance<00:05:02.830> he's<00:05:03.039> sitting<00:05:03.280> around<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:03.789> uh

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
chance he's sitting around because uh

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.480 
chance he's sitting around because uh
yeah<00:05:04.509> that<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.900> was<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.139> thing<00:05:05.319> so<00:05:05.889> he's

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
yeah that that was the thing so he's

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.010 
yeah that that was the thing so he's
gonna<00:05:06.699> go<00:05:06.849> for<00:05:06.880> earthquake<00:05:07.449> predicting<00:05:07.930> the

gonna go for earthquake predicting the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.510 
gonna go for earthquake predicting the
chance<00:05:08.229> he<00:05:08.380> I<00:05:08.409> may<00:05:08.830> be<00:05:08.889> predicting<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.370> chance

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
chance he I may be predicting the chance

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.559 
chance he I may be predicting the chance
he<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:09.849> they'll<00:05:09.940> probably<00:05:10.150> just<00:05:10.330> trying<00:05:10.479> to

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
he and they'll probably just trying to

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.230 
he and they'll probably just trying to
get<00:05:10.659> off<00:05:10.750> he<00:05:10.900> just<00:05:10.960> /<00:05:11.199> to<00:05:11.380> be<00:05:11.470> honest<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:12.400> he

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
get off he just / to be honest but he

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.760 
get off he just / to be honest but he
goes<00:05:13.360> for<00:05:13.509> dragon<00:05:13.750> call<00:05:13.840> he<00:05:13.960> gets<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.199> crit<00:05:14.530> I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
goes for dragon call he gets the crit I

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.320 
goes for dragon call he gets the crit I
would<00:05:15.370> thought<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.550> was<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.789> little<00:05:16.000> bit<00:05:16.090> low<00:05:16.300> so

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
would thought I was a little bit low so

would thought I was a little bit low so
I<00:05:16.569> was<00:05:16.659> gonna<00:05:16.780> soft<00:05:17.080> boil<00:05:17.289> anyway<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.770> it's<00:05:17.860> a

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
I was gonna soft boil anyway and it's a

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.680 
I was gonna soft boil anyway and it's a
good<00:05:18.069> thing<00:05:18.159> I<00:05:18.280> did<00:05:18.520> because<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:19.000> carry<00:05:19.210> toxic

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690

good thing I did because I carry toxic
not<00:05:19.870> T<00:05:20.020> wave<00:05:20.169> because<00:05:20.409> i'm<00:05:20.530> not<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.710> jerk<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.219> um

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
not T wave because i'm not a jerk and um

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.930 
not T wave because i'm not a jerk and um
maybe<00:05:23.110> more<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.469> a<00:05:23.650> jerk<00:05:23.889> depends<00:05:24.819> on<00:05:24.879> your

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
maybe more of a jerk depends on your

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.279 
maybe more of a jerk depends on your
point<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.270> view<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.569> know<00:05:25.900> he's<00:05:26.110> eating<00:05:26.259> the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
shadow sneak from happening because even

if he switched out into his his last
which<00:06:15.250> is<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.490> slow<00:06:15.729> king<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.180> would<00:06:16.539> be<00:06:16.630> able

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
which is the slow king I would be able

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.209 
which is the slow king I would be able
to<00:06:16.840> tear<00:06:17.080> it<00:06:17.169> apart<00:06:17.259> with<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.650> shadow<00:06:18.009> ball

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
to tear it apart with a shadow ball

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.620 
to tear it apart with a shadow ball
followed<00:06:18.550> up<00:06:18.639> by<00:06:18.669> a<00:06:18.789> shadow<00:06:19.000> snake<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.479> it's

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
followed up by a shadow snake and it's

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.939 
followed up by a shadow snake and it's
asleep<00:06:19.960> so<00:06:20.169> I<00:06:20.199> mean<00:06:20.380> it<00:06:20.469> wouldn't<00:06:20.650> been<00:06:20.770> able

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
asleep so I mean it wouldn't been able

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.279 
asleep so I mean it wouldn't been able
to<00:06:21.069> do<00:06:21.159> anything<00:06:21.400> to<00:06:21.639> me<00:06:21.729> anyway<00:06:22.289> regardless

to do anything to me anyway regardless
the<00:06:23.529> fact<00:06:23.710> that<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:23.949> sash<00:06:24.130> is<00:06:24.310> now<00:06:24.460> gone

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
the fact that the sash is now gone

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.879 
the fact that the sash is now gone
allows<00:06:25.449> me<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.719> go<00:06:25.840> out<00:06:25.930> into<00:06:26.080> greninja<00:06:26.590> and
