00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.020

 Today will be a busy day shooting 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.850
 but in general 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.640
 so let's go first in our 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.610
 today's release will sbn mean 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.709
 a little bit of history back in 1902 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.070
 Tula Arms Plant began production 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.410
 model TASS model b it means guns 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.650
 started producing it was a kurkovy 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.290
 shotguns with removable padlocks 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.480
 boards are not chrome trunks by the way 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.820
 The first models of pelvis b were not even 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.519
 twin trunks tables were connected 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.310
 clutch then means release a gun 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.549
 suddenly stopped and next time 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.070
 already resumed in the 20s until 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.560
 start of war then on start 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.599
 for the period of the Great Patriotic War 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.690
 the release of the gun was again stopped a 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:57.060
 starting at the age of 45 means guns 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.950
 produced until 1000 1956 then 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.640
 the guns were taken out of production and on his 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.590
 the place came just that sbn he was different 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.480
 from model b 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.550
 Yes, in principle, minor ladies difference 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.530
 Basically this is better than improved. 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.290
 strength characteristics of trunks and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.069
 general metal in general for an hour fifty 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.400
 the seventh year, then sbn was produced and 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.400
 it means to make it up to 63 years then 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 replaced by the 63 which in fact 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.640
 was the same pelvis bm but but with 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.340
 chrome trunks outwardly they were 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.110
 completely indistinguishable then go 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.540
 then 66 12 caliber still a bunch of guns but 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.580
 no less then sbm for connoisseurs for 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.709
 lovers so to speak inexpensive but 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.670
 classroom beautifully classic shotgun 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.769
 it remains exactly 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.530
 thick and so now we will see how 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.450
 this gun shoots 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.010
 means first shot he in those 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.440
 mineral water bottles 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.510
 let's see how they scatter but 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.060
 then try on target as far as 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 since the shotgun and the beautiful old must 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.100
 nice shoot and for this purpose I have for 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.109
 com equipped 2 no lie 4 cartridges with 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.109
 black powder and so we went 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.130
 by the way forgot to add 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.310
 shotgun locking barrels carried 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.160
 for 3 dotted means grenade hooks 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.639
 the frame is front and bolted up 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.830
 green 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.580
 open the gun locking lever to the right 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.210
 until it stops barrels open we charge two 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.270
 patron 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.810
 close guns enter the trigger and shoot 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810
 go 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:50.470
 flew off okay now we shoot 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:53.170
 terrorist let's go see where we are 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:59.320
 hit photo 1 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:02.110
 She is a broken one broken 1 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.390
 we'll fix it now but see 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.460
 On the body of vista, we shot fractions with a seven 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.620
 distance here well I do not know meters 20 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.950
 just for the sake of curiosity bahnuli pay 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.400
 attention how much he went fraction we 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.860
 fired from and and mayors 153 and zozhzhy 27 with 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.340
 what just did not shoot consists of 25 meters 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.050
 the same damn small fraction but the whole target 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.870
 was in holes and pay here as well 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.700
 smooth pile so well now east 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.740
 as a beautiful weapon should beautiful 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:36.820
 shoot let's go back to the original 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:39.010
 frontier and woman with smoke and so my 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.220
 favorite brass sleeve is my favorite 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.220
 black powder and number eight 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.810
 go 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.999
 oh let's go see where i got somewhere 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.259
 flew away 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:09.719
 egghead probably that's rambla cool than 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:14.469
 holes, see there a lot of fractions inside 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:20.379
 note fraction number eight but 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:21.960
 also pretty heap gone and now a 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.370
 now we will do 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.789
 shooting as it looks quite from 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.789
 parties 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:54.270
 and so here is the first part of the video about sbm 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.430
 principle can be completed we looked 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.270
 how cool this shotgun shoots to cool 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.099
 shoot from it and so let's 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.469
 continue in the second part about 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:23.479

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:23.479
