00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
about but I like I like odd times and I

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.940 
about but I like I like odd times and I
like<00:00:15.180> to<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:15.809> odd<00:00:16.049> times<00:00:16.379> sound<00:00:16.800> like

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
like to make odd times sound like

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.920 
like to make odd times sound like
they're<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.279> odd<00:00:17.400> times<00:00:17.700> yeah<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.900> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
they're not odd times yeah and one of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859 
they're not odd times yeah and one of
the<00:00:19.080> techniques<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> something<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.869> call

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the techniques I use is something I call

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.290 
the techniques I use is something I call
overriding<00:00:22.650> other<00:00:23.550> people<00:00:23.910> might<00:00:24.060> call<00:00:24.240> it

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
overriding other people might call it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.850 
overriding other people might call it
something<00:00:24.540> different<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.050> overriding<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
something different and overriding is

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.499 
something different and overriding is
when<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.309> pattern<00:00:26.579> like<00:00:26.790> this<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.059> 7/8

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
when you have a pattern like this in 7/8

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:36.500 
when you have a pattern like this in 7/8
and<00:00:33.469> I'm<00:00:34.469> playing<00:00:35.040> eighth<00:00:35.850> notes<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.420> my

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and I'm playing eighth notes with my

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.010 
and I'm playing eighth notes with my
right<00:00:36.690> hand

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
right hand

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
right hand
right<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> start<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> accent<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
right so then I start to accent just the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:50.569 
right so then I start to accent just the
quarter<00:00:39.180> notes<00:00:47.810> so<00:00:48.810> these<00:00:49.020> accents<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
quarter notes so these accents now the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.110 
quarter notes so these accents now the
audience<00:00:50.970> don't<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.780> jerky<00:00:52.640> 7/8<00:00:53.640> feeling

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
audience don't have a jerky 7/8 feeling

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
audience don't have a jerky 7/8 feeling
suddenly<00:00:54.900> they're<00:00:55.200> hearing<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> thing<00:01:00.260> and

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.789 
whole thing flow and you can make nice
grooves<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.660> don't<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> two<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
grooves you don't have to have two and

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.000 
grooves you don't have to have two and
four<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.790> make<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> groove<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:49.170> heard<00:02:49.860> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
four to make a groove and I heard that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.559 
four to make a groove and I heard that
in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.400> things<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.879> did<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.150> heard<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
in the things that you did I heard the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.600 
in the things that you did I heard the
things<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> Steve<00:02:52.170> Gadd<00:02:52.410> played<00:02:52.739> when<00:02:53.459> he

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
things that Steve Gadd played when he

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.759 
things that Steve Gadd played when he
played<00:02:53.819> in<00:02:53.970> seven<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.599> sounded<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.379> cool<00:02:55.620> as

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
played in seven it sounded as cool as

played in seven it sounded as cool as
when<00:02:55.920> he<00:02:56.010> played<00:02:56.190> him<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.549> four<00:02:56.849> yeah<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.420> had

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
when he played him for four yeah it had

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.129 
when he played him for four yeah it had
a<00:02:57.569> nice<00:02:58.140> laid<00:02:58.590> back<00:02:58.860> time<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.610> on<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:01.019> know

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
a nice laid back time going on you know

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.259 
a nice laid back time going on you know
I<00:03:01.170> heard<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.739> lot<00:03:01.889> of<00:03:01.950> drummers<00:03:02.760> especially<00:03:03.180> in

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
I heard a lot of drummers especially in

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.599 
I heard a lot of drummers especially in
England<00:03:03.540> playing<00:03:04.170> odd<00:03:04.350> times<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.950> never<00:03:05.250> felt

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
England playing odd times it never felt

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.759 
England playing odd times it never felt
good<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.450> was<00:03:06.569> always<00:03:06.660> very<00:03:06.810> jerky<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
good it was always very jerky and and

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.670 
good it was always very jerky and and
the<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.790> only<00:03:08.910> interest<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.690> was<00:03:09.870> hey<00:03:10.440> this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
the the only interest in it was hey this

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.559 
the the only interest in it was hey this
is<00:03:10.829> an<00:03:10.920> odd<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.609> check<00:03:11.639> out<00:03:12.060> how<00:03:12.209> clever<00:03:12.480> I

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
is an odd time so check out how clever I

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.470 
is an odd time so check out how clever I
am<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.799> realized<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:15.030> doesn't<00:03:15.389> need

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
am and I realized that it doesn't need

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.449 
am and I realized that it doesn't need
to<00:03:15.630> be<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.810> there's<00:03:16.680> plenty<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.980> cultures

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
to be that there's plenty of cultures

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.000 
to be that there's plenty of cultures
around<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:17.910> world<00:03:17.970> who<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.480> nice<00:03:18.750> timing<00:03:19.680> you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
around the world who do nice timing you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.620 
around the world who do nice timing you
know

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
know

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.349 
know
Greece<00:03:21.630> they<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> great<00:03:22.260> thing<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.620> nine<00:03:22.859> and

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
Greece they do a great thing in nine and

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.180 
Greece they do a great thing in nine and
it<00:03:24.359> grooves<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.079> mad<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:26.010> know

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
it grooves like mad you know

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.080 
it grooves like mad you know
so<00:03:26.849> area<00:03:27.269> exactly<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.440> mean<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.889> yeah<00:03:29.280> it's

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
so area exactly I mean just yeah it's

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.080 
so area exactly I mean just yeah it's
something<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.599> doesn't<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.349> be<00:03:32.090> kind

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
something that doesn't have to be kind

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.550 
something that doesn't have to be kind
of<00:03:33.150> complicated<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.200> hell<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.380> it

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
of complicated just for the hell of it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.470 
of complicated just for the hell of it
yeah<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.910> trying<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> make<00:03:36.329> odd

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
yeah and I like to trying to make odd

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.650 
yeah and I like to trying to make odd
times<00:03:36.840> feel<00:03:37.669> even<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.880> sometimes<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.359> like<00:03:39.510> to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
times feel even and sometimes I like to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.809 
times feel even and sometimes I like to
make<00:03:39.810> four<00:03:40.380> four<00:03:40.680> feel<00:03:41.280> like<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:41.669> in<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
make four four feel like it's in a

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.729 
make four four feel like it's in a
different<00:03:42.000> time<00:03:42.329> signature<00:03:42.810> now<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.169> mean<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
different time signature now I mean and

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.069 
different time signature now I mean and
you<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:43.950> play<00:03:44.130> tricks<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.819> that<00:03:45.599> led<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
you can play tricks and that led to the

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.110 
you can play tricks and that led to the
columns<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.859> was<00:03:47.069> writing<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.970> book

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
columns that I was writing and a book

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.650 
columns that I was writing and a book
called<00:03:48.359> rhythmic<00:03:48.660> illusions<00:03:49.109> right<00:03:49.530> where<00:03:50.190> I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
called rhythmic illusions right where I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.150 
called rhythmic illusions right where I
you<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:51.780> described<00:03:52.290> different<00:03:52.709> ways<00:03:52.859> of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
you know described different ways of

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.449 
you know described different ways of
doing<00:03:54.150> metric<00:03:54.660> modulation<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.470> displacement

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
doing metric modulation and displacement

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.470 
doing metric modulation and displacement
and<00:03:57.680> making<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> 4/4<00:03:59.579> beat<00:03:59.790> sound<00:04:00.180> like<00:04:00.329> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and making the 4/4 beat sound like it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.690 
and making the 4/4 beat sound like it
had<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.630> new<00:04:00.810> downbeat<00:04:01.290> or<00:04:01.470> making<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> 4/4

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
had a new downbeat or making the 4/4

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.270 
had a new downbeat or making the 4/4
beat<00:04:02.910> feel<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.720> had<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> new<00:04:04.079> tempo<00:04:04.560> where

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
beat feel like you had a new tempo where

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.369 
beat feel like you had a new tempo where
all<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.610> time<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.030> only<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.269> suit<00:04:06.569> sort<00:04:07.319> of

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
all the time it's only a suit sort of

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.780 
all the time it's only a suit sort of
superimposed<00:04:07.650> idea

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
superimposed idea

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.940 
superimposed idea
and<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.390> fourth<00:04:09.870> or<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.260> there<00:04:10.469> all<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.950> time

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.010 

you
