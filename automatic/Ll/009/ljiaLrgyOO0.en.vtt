 international of sarno in the province of 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.330
 Salerno performed the third act 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.280
 of the 2013 season 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.350
 as usual three classes on the track 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.239
 scooter matic extreme italia scooter 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.629
 matic and regions and matic scooters 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.460
 replicated in the extreme matica scooter 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.140
 Italy continues the struggle on the wire of the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.700
 razor among the leaders of the ranking 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.710
 antonio paduano who signs the pole 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.480
 position and antonio milone second on 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.370
 deployment of the royal cellaello colella 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.589
 hedgehog and model complete the grid 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.690
 art tender 1 and paduano preserves the first 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.550
 melon position is immediately put on 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.860
 wake and also colella seems initially 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.540
 keep the same tread pace on 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.190
 train of pursuers loses well 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.870
 soon the traces of the first maloney 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.820
 millions and run away like a script 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.650
 on the third lap comes the first attack 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.000
 the bearer of the ps team and exploits the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.800
 wake on the long straight 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.510
 passing in the lead in the center 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.130
 coviello and hedgehog group fight for 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.170
 a placement while they are more detached 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.940
 real and two laps later 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.290
 Paduan takes the lead with one 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.450
 beautiful detached at the bottom of the right of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.440
 boxing the challenge between the two is really al 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.570
 thousandth of a second 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.530
 constantly melee but always 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.940
 very correct 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.470
 the heat and you decide on the eighth lap 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.030
 melon takes the wake of Paduan 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.570
 overtaking it again before 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.400
 parabolic 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.230
 this time with an internal trajectory 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.790
 let's not let go but the number 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
 21 closes all the doors up to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.780
 checkered flag colella and third la 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.460
 Start of race 2 is a photocopy of 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 first patuano aimed at the head of the first 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.090
 curve followed by melon the number 69 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.920
 takes a few meters in the lines 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.020
 initials while melons try to mend 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.150
 the rip while reviving and are real 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.190
 in third and fourth position in a few 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.210
 turn the number 21 to 0 the detachment from the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.830
 race leader 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.360
 unlike the first run but not 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.100
 immediately launches the attack but it seems 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 study his opponent to them 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.060
 shoulders in the meantime dates coviello who 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.590
 over the zip 4 real times yes 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.480
 chases the hunt for le 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.900
 positions change at the ninth of the 12 rounds 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.310
 expected 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.929
 melons and uses the Paduan trail 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 always in the straight that leads to 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.769
 parabolic taking the lead and also 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.690
 coviello wins the third place at 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.489
 damage to the final result is 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.230
 uncertain and of the last round to reveal itself 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.610
 decisive Paduan crosses well 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.140
 trajectory in the slow section of the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.790
 track takes advantage of a small one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.379
 indecision of melon and passes into the head 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.069
 keeping the leadership up to 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.900
 checkered flag 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.050
 the sprint for third place is instead 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.630
 won by revival 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.280
 so nice fourth for sum of hand 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.080
 then wins the sarno stage with 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.930
 melons revive on the podium this year 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.180
 it will be just a poker game not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.020
 he will never know who will win the championship up 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.290
 to the next race 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.510
 I obviously always put in the maximum 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 he proves it to this day even if he had 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.600
 however, the problems of transmission piles 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.820
 he knew how to handle me until the end a 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.430
 make a race with alessandro own from 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.920
 superbikes detached to the limit with means 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.290
 always broken down I think it's not easy 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.050
 to do then go 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.370
 I know I am waiting for the next race 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.370
 bari to see how it went 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.130
 after the good performance of viterbo 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.360
 filippo tognarelli puts it back in 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.550
 shows his speed qualities 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.170
 conquering the pole at sarno d'andrea e 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.150
 adinolfi flanks him in the front row 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.250
 while from the second take the leader 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.410
 of the Formisano trophy then basted and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.730
 the traffic light of race 1 goes off 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.440
 and it is to emilio of andrea to take the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.790
 travel command also offers a 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.070
 excellent start and takes second 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.570
 position while tognarelli and third i 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.460
 first five are very compact 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.050
 adinolfi attacks from andrea per second 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.000
 around taking momentarily to the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.250
 command and the excellent one should also be reported 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 go up formisano number 51 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.320
 complete his comeback before half 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.760
 race 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.680
 inserting adinolfi in the last corner 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.600
 of the track the brawl remains however 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.040
 very tight and very little is enough for 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.710
 lose precious positions 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.480
 said done at the third Formisano session 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.610
 is repassed by adinolfi d'andrea e 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.840
 tognarelli the main train remains 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.430
 however in less than a second 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.320
 and in the final stages the positions 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.090
 change several times for a couple of laps and 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.630
 tognarelli to command outdated quads 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.640
 to andrea 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.050
 the bearer of the team from Bari seems to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.060
 able to stretch and his leadership 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.010
 definitively secured from 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.420
 contact on the last lap between formisano 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.070
 tognarelli under the checkered flag 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.930
 da andrea wins his first race 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.030
 in the malossi adinolfi and second trophies 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.830
 then in the third rallies on the second route of 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.720
 new excellent starting point for d'andrea il 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.490
 number 88 finds himself on the same stage 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.410
 protagonists of the first adinolfi race 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.090
 tognarelli imbastaro and formisano piÃ¹ 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.590
 detached the rest of the group with garelli 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.750
 he has an excellent pace and takes the lead 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.520
 on the third lap also formisano seems to 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.780
 ball and the two compete for the first 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.970
 position for the entire central phase 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.860
 of the race overtaking several times 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.080
 watch out for each bastard number 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.850
 42 after passing d'andrea you put on 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.500
 to the hunt for treads by slipping them on 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.300
 both during the eighth lap 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.040
 two sessions of formisano pass yes 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.540
 the veteran of the 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.310
 Malossi trophies want to make up after the 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.960
 bad result of race 1 but bastion 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.090
 does not let go and just around the corner 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.500
 conclusive exceeds formisano by resisting 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.419
 to his attacks until the last corner 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.520
 of the bastard race wins so ahead 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.200
 a formisano and knows the fourth place 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.150
 enough instead has better from andrea for 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.130
 conquer the stage ahead of sarno 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.710
 adinofi basking and I am very happy 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.960
 for the victory there were two races 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.210
 very difficult fought until 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.070
 I did it fine 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.980
 I am very happy I thank my team 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.580
 niba racing that always comes with a scooter 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.680
 at the top and the sponsor moran ice cream bar 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.600
 in the person of the papal journey that I am 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.600
 always accompanies let's see you next time 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.310
 that the matic scooter replicates alessio 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 patron signs the pole position and precedes 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.970
 in the front row liuzzi and quartarone 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.190
 relatives mancusi occupy the fourth e 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.630
 fifth box part race 1 paduan 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.400
 keeps the head of the race while 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.000
 quartarone slips the first one 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.500
 curve 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.150
 already during the first round 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.250
 number 26 resumes the second square 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.169
 with quartarone who must beware of them 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.580
 shoulders from luigi relative not even one is more 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.720
 detached while paduan extends 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.190
 easily in the head 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.140
 liuzzi in fact despite having scored 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.669
 a very interesting time trial in qualifying 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.919
 can't keep up a good pace 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.360
 during the race on the sixth lap and leader 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.490
 of the race begins to administer 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.530
 avoiding unnecessary risks and liuzzi in 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.940
 final tries to get closer Paduan 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.410
 thus puts the fastest lap of the 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.330
 race making his opponent guess 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.200
 direct that it is better to settle for 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.880
 second square 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.560
 comes the checkered flag and alessio 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.240
 paduano wins his first monoruote 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.340
 race in the scootermatic replica in front 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.870
 in liuzzi and quartarone at the start of the 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.370
 second heat good starting point for liuzzi 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.960
 but Paduano immediately closes the door 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.090
 keeping the head of the race 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.979
 the battipagliese as happened in race 1 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.750
 imposes a rhythm from the very beginning 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.700
 unsustainable for others by lengthening 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.620
 the group easily shells and the 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.210
 positions appear frozen the only a 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.770
 earn a placement and misses that 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.539
 take advantage of the withdrawal of relatives for 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.430
 technical problems passed in the middle of the race 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.560
 quartarone virtually on the podium of 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.510
 day while liuzzi tries to force 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.050
 the pace trying to keep up with 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.700
 paduano 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.440
 the situation, however, completely below 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.060
 check for the team bearer a 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.830
 wax that appears able to lead to 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.660
 home the double with these positions 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.310
 then we arrive at the checkered flag 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.050

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.450
 quartarone liuzzi on the podium
