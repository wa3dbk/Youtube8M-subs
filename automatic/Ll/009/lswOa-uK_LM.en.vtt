 there are two types of floor products 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 of ceramic and porcelain tiles, the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.970
 production is that the porcelain tile is made with 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.770
 mixtures of porcelain and some minerals 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.960
 already the ceramic floor is composed of a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 type of clay and minerals 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 the porcelain tile practically does not absorb 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 water and is a high strength product 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.540
 in the case of ceramic flooring its 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 resistance can be assessed through 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.619
 a feature called breast that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.110
 ranges from 0 to 5 the higher the number 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.110
 most traffic resistant is the floor 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.890
 there is also a difference 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.560
 finishing at the edges of products 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 some are ratified known as 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.039
 straight edge and others are well-known trams 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 like rounded edges approaches straight 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.750
 allows less space between the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.819
 settled products already addresses 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.689
 rounded leaves the ti regimen more 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.569

 porcelain tiles is necessary since the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.340
 for attaching a spacer to the

 definition of joint and grout to give 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.150
 finish and do not forget it 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.920
