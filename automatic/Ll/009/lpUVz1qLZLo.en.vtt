00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
about the differences if there are any

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
about the differences if there are any
about<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.960> teams<00:00:25.470> teams<00:00:25.980> play<00:00:26.279> compared<00:00:26.939> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
about that teams teams play compared to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
about that teams teams play compared to
last<00:00:27.150> year<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
last year you know I think we have a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
last year you know I think we have a
good<00:00:29.250> base<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.910> structure<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.480> last<00:00:30.779> year

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
good base and structure from last year

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.749 
good base and structure from last year
with<00:00:31.289> Erica<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.219> most<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> boys

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
with Erica and we have most of the boys

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.490 
with Erica and we have most of the boys
back<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> locker<00:00:33.510> room<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:33.960> last<00:00:34.200> year's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
back in the locker room from last year's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
back in the locker room from last year's
team<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.610> understand<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> coaches

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
team so we understand what the coaches

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
team so we understand what the coaches
are<00:00:36.750> trying<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> tell<00:00:37.260> us<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.399> after

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
are trying to tell us and I think after

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
are trying to tell us and I think after
this<00:00:38.820> amount<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.540> practicing<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this amount of time of practicing on it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.420 
this amount of time of practicing on it
that<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:40.620> starting<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.190> comfortable

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that we're starting to get comfortable

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
that we're starting to get comfortable
with<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> shows<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.500> our

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
with it so I think that shows in our

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
with it so I think that shows in our
game<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.489> controlled<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
game when we can be controlled and have

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
game when we can be controlled and have
the<00:00:46.260> puck<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.530> our<00:00:46.680> stick<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> lot<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the puck on our stick a lot and just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.510 
the puck on our stick a lot and just
kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.820> dictate<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> tempo<00:00:49.100> Steve<00:00:50.100> Moses

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
kind of dictate the tempo Steve Moses

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.119 
kind of dictate the tempo Steve Moses
