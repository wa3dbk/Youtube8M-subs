00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.839 

I<00:02:53.480> could<00:02:54.480> only<00:02:54.510> say<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:56.510> know<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.989> Brahms

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
I could only say that I know that Brahms

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.490 
I could only say that I know that Brahms
waited<00:02:59.849> a<00:02:59.970> very<00:03:00.000> long<00:03:00.330> time<00:03:00.720> before<00:03:00.989> he<00:03:01.200> wrote

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
waited a very long time before he wrote

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.949 
waited a very long time before he wrote
symphony<00:03:02.069> because<00:03:02.370> he<00:03:02.489> felt<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.480> shadow<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
symphony because he felt the shadow of

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.039 
symphony because he felt the shadow of
bitumen<00:03:05.000> on<00:03:06.000> him<00:03:07.250> rightly<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.280> maybe<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:10.970> he

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
bitumen on him rightly so maybe and he

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.199 
bitumen on him rightly so maybe and he
when<00:03:13.049> he<00:03:13.200> finally<00:03:13.530> wrote<00:03:14.099> his<00:03:14.549> first<00:03:14.879> symphony

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
when he finally wrote his first symphony

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.250 
when he finally wrote his first symphony
it<00:03:15.959> felt<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.590> some<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.129> it<00:03:17.280> would<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.640> kind<00:03:18.060> of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
it felt to some that it would be kind of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.289 
it felt to some that it would be kind of
extension<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.650> Beethoven<00:03:20.250> nine<00:03:20.489> because<00:03:20.819> the

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
extension of Beethoven nine because the

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.170 
extension of Beethoven nine because the
last<00:03:21.599> movement<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:25.670> think<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:26.940> very

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
last movement and I think it's a very

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.009 
last movement and I think it's a very
exciting<00:03:27.360> piece<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.319> it's<00:03:29.090> I'm<00:03:30.090> very<00:03:30.810> glad

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
exciting piece and it's I'm very glad

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.900 
exciting piece and it's I'm very glad
that<00:03:31.140> he<00:03:31.470> finally<00:03:31.739> managed<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.519> write<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
that he finally managed to write a

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.559 
that he finally managed to write a
symphony<00:03:33.390> because<00:03:34.519> his<00:03:35.519> four<00:03:35.880> symphonies<00:03:36.180> are

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
symphony because his four symphonies are

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.830 
symphony because his four symphonies are
great<00:03:37.400> contribution<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:39.209> form<00:03:39.569> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
great contribution to the form of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.400 
great contribution to the form of
symphony<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.920> very<00:03:41.910> much<00:03:41.970> believe<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.750> form<00:03:45.170> um

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.710
