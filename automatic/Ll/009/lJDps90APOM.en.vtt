the purpose of this video I'm going to
be<00:00:24.150> using<00:00:24.359> Windows<00:00:24.720> 8.1<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:26.039> basically<00:00:26.430> going

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
be using Windows 8.1 I'm basically going

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
be using Windows 8.1 I'm basically going
to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.820> showing<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.150> how<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.300> create<00:00:27.630> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
to be showing you how to create this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
to be showing you how to create this
tile<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.570> shutdown<00:00:30.900> option

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
tile here and that is a shutdown option

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.319 
tile here and that is a shutdown option
which<00:00:32.099> enables<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> literally<00:00:33.180> just

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
which enables you to literally just

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
which enables you to literally just
press<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.989> your<00:00:34.320> windows<00:00:34.829> 8<00:00:34.950> machine

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
press that and your windows 8 machine

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.400 
press that and your windows 8 machine
will<00:00:35.370> shut<00:00:35.550> down<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.630> saves<00:00:36.930> having<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
will shut down and this saves having to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.830 
will shut down and this saves having to
go<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> right-hand<00:00:38.579> corner<00:00:38.840> settings

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
go into the right-hand corner settings

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.799 
go into the right-hand corner settings
power<00:00:40.620> shutdown<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.210> obviously<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
power shutdown and obviously by that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.000 
power shutdown and obviously by that
time<00:00:43.020> we've<00:00:43.200> usually<00:00:43.469> forgotten<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
time we've usually forgotten what you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
time we've usually forgotten what you
wanted<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.329> option<00:00:45.480> if

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
wanted to do so this is a good option if

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
wanted to do so this is a good option if
you<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> able<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> shut<00:00:47.610> down<00:00:47.670> your

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
you want to be able to shut down your

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
you want to be able to shut down your
machine<00:00:48.329> quickly<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> create<00:00:49.890> this

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
machine quickly so to create this

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
machine quickly so to create this
shortcut<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> fairly<00:00:51.300> simple<00:00:51.570> procedure

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
shortcut it is a fairly simple procedure

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810 
shortcut it is a fairly simple procedure
all<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.770> need<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> desktop

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
all you need to do is go to the desktop

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.619 
all you need to do is go to the desktop
and<00:00:54.090> create<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.989> new<00:00:55.140> shortcut<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and create a new shortcut and this

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
and create a new shortcut and this
shortcut<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.579> shutdown<00:01:00.090> off<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
shortcut will use the shutdown off to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.810 
shortcut will use the shutdown off to
exe<00:01:00.750> file<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.230> found<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.710> Windows<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
exe file that's found in Windows so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
exe file that's found in Windows so
there's<00:01:02.969> no<00:01:03.059> need<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> download<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.899> other

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
there's no need to download any other

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.649 
there's no need to download any other
programs<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.519> need<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.090> type<00:01:06.360> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
programs what we need to do is type in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
programs what we need to do is type in
the<00:01:06.689> location<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> literally<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the location which is literally just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.250 
the location which is literally just
shutdown<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:12.119> order<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
shutdown and in order to make the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.679 
shutdown and in order to make the
Machine<00:01:13.530> shutdown<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.390> allow<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> computer

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Machine shutdown and allow the computer

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
Machine shutdown and allow the computer
to<00:01:15.960> interpret<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:16.680> telling<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to interpret what we're telling it is we

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.590 
to interpret what we're telling it is we
need<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> type<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.869> command<00:01:19.619> arguments<00:01:20.570> /s

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
need to type the command arguments /s

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
need to type the command arguments /s
and<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> basically<00:01:22.920> tells<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> machine<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and that basically tells the machine to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.390 
and that basically tells the machine to
shut<00:01:24.150> down<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.869> could<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> /r<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.189> would

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
shut down you could use a /r which would

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
shut down you could use a /r which would
make<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.299> machine<00:01:27.450> reboot<00:01:27.930> after<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.860> slash

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
make your machine reboot after the slash

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
make your machine reboot after the slash
s<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.610> need<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> type<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.270> /t<00:01:31.490> 0<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
s we need to type in /t 0 and what that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
s we need to type in /t 0 and what that
does<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.110> basically<00:01:34.320> sets<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> timeout<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.579> 0

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
does is it basically sets a timeout to 0

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.030 
does is it basically sets a timeout to 0
seconds<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> machine<00:01:37.650> shuts<00:01:37.890> down

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
seconds so the machine shuts down

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
seconds so the machine shuts down
instantly<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.060> she<00:01:39.180> taught<00:01:39.390> night<00:01:39.570> news<00:01:39.780> hit

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
instantly so she taught night news hit

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.999 
instantly so she taught night news hit
next<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.729> we're<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.820> call<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:43.009> Chilkoot

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
next and we're gonna call the Chilkoot

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.140 
next and we're gonna call the Chilkoot
shut<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> hit<00:01:47.130> finish

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
shut down and hit finish

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.640 
shut down and hit finish
and<00:01:49.660> as<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.930> see<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.200> creative<00:01:50.560> this

we've got two icons here that one's
already<00:03:32.739> pinned<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> Start<00:03:33.430> menu<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:35.050> can

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
already pinned to the Start menu we can

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.880 
already pinned to the Start menu we can
opt<00:03:35.320> in<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.620> one<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.920> Start<00:03:36.160> menu<00:03:36.190> and

opt in this one to the Start menu and
that<00:03:38.890> appears<00:03:39.580> there<00:03:39.790> too<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.530> obviously

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
that appears there too so obviously

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.160 
that appears there too so obviously
these<00:03:41.950> out<00:03:42.250> as<00:03:42.550> normal<00:03:42.790> tiles<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.870> we<00:03:43.959> can<00:03:44.080> just

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
these out as normal tiles so we can just

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.600 
these out as normal tiles so we can just
put<00:03:44.350> them<00:03:44.560> anywhere<00:03:45.720> for<00:03:46.720> example<00:03:47.050> here<00:03:47.230> and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
put them anywhere for example here and

put them anywhere for example here and
by<00:03:48.610> pressing<00:03:49.000> either<00:03:49.180> those<00:03:49.450> they<00:03:50.410> will

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
by pressing either those they will

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.250 
by pressing either those they will
trigger<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.070> command<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.760> run<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.930> for

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
trigger the command to run so for

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.140 
trigger the command to run so for
example<00:03:53.590> we're<00:03:53.680> now<00:03:53.769> going<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.010> shut<00:03:54.160> down<00:03:54.190> and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
example we're now going to shut down and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.199 
example we're now going to shut down and
restart<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.870> computer<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.030> when

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
restart the computer so to do that when

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
machine will automatically restart

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.809 
machine will automatically restart
we<00:04:02.739> can<00:04:02.860> also<00:04:02.980> check<00:04:03.190> out<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.430> shutdown

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819
