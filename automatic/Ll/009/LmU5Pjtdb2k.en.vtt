 craftsmanship that charms and absolute night 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.379
 started to start grace 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.050
 good morning ladies, we start with the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.590
 cushion 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.280
 as always we have a scheme on 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.280
 Today's scheme is worked on 48 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.550
 centimeters by 48 between the mechanics 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 we have the scheme and here is how 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.620
 let's go to work let's start with 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.230
 the corners and there in the form of a cross for 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.800
 achieve what we have here good 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.890
 we start 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.980
 we start with one of the vertices with 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 always thread and high do not bend with a 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:44.009
 good thread we started at point 1 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.520
 here we give a stitch and we go back to 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.659
 finish do not forget this 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.720
 let's go to point 2 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:58.660
 from 2 I'm going to point 3 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.660
 and of 3 I return as always to 1 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.630
 and here gather shot shot shot and gather 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
 I will hold in this way and I will 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.510
 top off 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.310
 so that this does not come loose in some 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.520
 how many stitches are we going to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.170
 do fast and let's finish this is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.110
 what will I be in point 1 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.410
 I'm working only the vertex 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.850
 I go to the 2nd to my second square that 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.380
 I will work triangle point 1 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.750
 stitch and finished point 2 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.220
 point 3 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.220
 and I go back to 4 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 and here again I frown 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.240
 I hold if we hold in this way 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.970
 we can finish 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.910
 good and strong always some stitches and 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.010
 I go back to finish it off so I'm going to 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.230
 keep going up they are nothing more than five 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.550
 in each of the corners yes 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.550
 let's go to what is central 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.709
 in the center I will have three columns 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.349
 the first start in the end comes in 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.230
 the edge and the next two 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.230
 we left a grid and started 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.610
 mark to mark the center 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.379
 same we will always leave a 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.870
 grid in the scheme is fine 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:34.970
 explained let's start with this one 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.610
 the left side as always 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.000
 top of top 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.080
 point 2 subject 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 point 3 and I return to 1 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.860
 and there I go to pull the thread subject of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.710
 this way always trying to sustain 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.710
 to be able to take all the fabrics 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.750
 and you are going to give more stitches and 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.720
 finish if I go up I always go 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.740
 to go up I'm not going to the side but 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.270
 that I will always work the column 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.430
 I go to 2 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.610
 that is my second grid that is 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.260
 marked in the same way and I'm going to 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.680
 keep climbing 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.990
 I always have to go to 1 so that I 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 are well formed many people what 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.290
 make from 1 to 2 from 2 to 3 and there it closes 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.420
 but when they close it loosens the point 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.720
 instead in this way the point is not 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.870
 it's going to loosen up and I can finish 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 holding up well I come back and continue are 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.360
 nothing more than in this case are 4 and the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.160
 from the center I will have one more that is 5 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.560
 yes 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.640
 they will work it until they finish 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.630
 the whole grid will be left 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.450
 finished this 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.640
 both those that are the diagonals as the 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.770
 center we end up in the center after 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.920
 to place a pearl and hold on 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.040
 this way we hold here the two 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.450
 lateral 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.360
 and we have the stitch left for later 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.730
 I can put the pearl I want to show you 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.030
 something that is very important on the side of 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.120
 reverse 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.440
 how we have to finish the tips and 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.560
 center 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.600
 this way we're going to do it here 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.380
 is going to form a table that we are going 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.750
 to join like this if some want can 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.730
 do it with some stitches if you do not 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.400
 encourage sewing directly with 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.920
 pins do it that way if they are going to sew it 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.070
 with pins the pins go from the side 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.770
 Reverse the opposite of what we will 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.040
 harass because we can pass the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.160
 machine and nothing will happen to the machine 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.820
 is going to draw the pin for the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.400
 We passed the same center will assemble the 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:05.410
 tablitas agree how the design comes 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.990
 there if I want to sew it I'm going to put it on 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.290
 back the pins because I can pass 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.380
 the machine by him with the contours and not 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.600
 nothing is going to happen so stay 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.130
 well all to the machine for the oils and 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.960
 if we put a rent and this 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.180
 aha way and we have it this way 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.960
 not to look new by you know or you 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.729
 hook the needle of the mclaren with the 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.279
 row 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.289
 but so they have to be left so that 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.270
 endings fit us well and those that 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.199
 they do not dare with him in the end they give him a 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.270
 Hilván successfully but quickly and asia 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.240
 but we keep following the diagram without 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.249
 pentagram is perfectly dried and 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.379
 it's something very, very fast and very easy if 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:49.099
 when we chiquititos to put 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:52.620
 many clear is like to put many 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:54.719
 all of different shades without depending the 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.300
 decoration of each house but really 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:02.280
 what is heaven 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.169
 the drawing is beautiful is said to lose them 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.419
 very cute with what each one is 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.930
 at number 2 but still on the street 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:13.229
 we have the number one captains that 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.930
 will be toast and more beautiful good 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:18.599
 many more thanks I 'm looking at 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.639
 the next one is good and now we 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:23.129
 let's go to a cut and continue with martín 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:28.550
 muñoz and we are going to be some very cute 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:28.550
 bowls in resin with inclusions
