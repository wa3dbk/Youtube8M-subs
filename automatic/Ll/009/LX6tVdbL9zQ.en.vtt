00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
situation here just got a hot just got a

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.850 
situation here just got a hot just got a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
lot worse the gravity failure came as we

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.090 
lot worse the gravity failure came as we
were<00:05:34.300> collating<00:05:35.300> nest<00:05:35.630> roids<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.200> one<00:05:36.860> break

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
were collating nest roids and one break

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.520 
were collating nest roids and one break

really<00:05:51.170> use<00:05:51.380> some<00:05:51.500> engineering<00:05:51.890> help<00:05:52.100> up<00:05:52.250> it

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
really use some engineering help up it

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.650 
really use some engineering help up it
yep<00:05:54.560> good<00:05:55.460> job<00:05:55.580> i'm<00:05:55.760> an<00:05:55.880> engineer<00:05:56.270> then<00:05:56.450> isn't

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
yep good job i'm an engineer then isn't

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.130 
yep good job i'm an engineer then isn't
it<00:05:56.800> or<00:05:57.800> am<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.670> I<00:06:00.070> don't<00:06:01.070> remember<00:06:01.160> what<00:06:01.520> I<00:06:01.550> am

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
get in from here oh I got to go around

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.059 
get in from here oh I got to go around
here<00:07:15.590> to<00:07:15.770> get<00:07:15.889> it<00:07:17.830> fail-safe<00:07:18.830> on<00:07:18.979> the

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:19.069 
here to get it fail-safe on the

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.550 
here to get it fail-safe on the
processing<00:07:19.580> controlled<00:07:20.060> or<00:07:20.240> the<00:07:20.599> open<00:07:21.349> until

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
processing controlled or the open until

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.679 
processing controlled or the open until
gravity<00:07:21.979> is<00:07:22.069> restored<00:07:22.520> but<00:07:23.120> you<00:07:23.210> can<00:07:23.449> turn<00:07:23.569> on

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:23.689 
gravity is restored but you can turn on

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.300 
gravity is restored but you can turn on
the<00:07:23.810> gravity<00:07:24.139> until<00:07:24.319> those<00:07:24.620> boulders<00:07:25.069> are

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
the gravity until those boulders are

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.459 
the gravity until those boulders are
cleared<00:07:25.580> from<00:07:25.639> the<00:07:25.729> room<00:07:26.000> baldus<00:07:26.719> maybe<00:07:27.319> you

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469 
cleared from the room baldus maybe you

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.019 
cleared from the room baldus maybe you
can<00:07:27.620> dump<00:07:27.860> them<00:07:28.039> into<00:07:28.219> that<00:07:28.430> gravity<00:07:28.879> beam

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:29.029 
can dump them into that gravity beam

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.290 
can dump them into that gravity beam
with<00:07:29.180> your<00:07:29.210> tininess<00:07:29.539> done<00:07:29.960> oh<00:07:30.169> I<00:07:30.259> can<00:07:31.300> kinesis
