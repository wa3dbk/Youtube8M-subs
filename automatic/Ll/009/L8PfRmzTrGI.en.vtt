00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
they're a lot heavier than the actual 8

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.730 
they're a lot heavier than the actual 8
40<00:02:42.150> s<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.720> be<00:02:42.810> completely<00:02:43.170> honest<00:02:43.410> they're<00:02:43.560> not

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
40 s to be completely honest they're not

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.380 
40 s to be completely honest they're not
that<00:02:44.010> much<00:02:44.190> heavier<00:02:44.550> okay<00:02:44.850> now<00:02:45.030> picking<00:02:45.300> them

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that much heavier okay now picking them

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
that much heavier okay now picking them
up<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.630> little<00:02:45.750> bit<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> little<00:02:46.290> bit

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
up there a little bit there a little bit

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.830 
up there a little bit there a little bit
but<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> thing<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.180> there<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.330> battery<00:02:48.570> on

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
but the thing is there is a battery on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.780 
but the thing is there is a battery on
in<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.680> they're<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:50.310> as<00:02:50.430> heavy<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.700> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
in here so they're not as heavy as I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280 
in here so they're not as heavy as I
expected<00:02:50.970> them<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:51.360> because<00:02:51.690> these<00:02:52.050> ones

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
expected them to be because these ones

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.630 
expected them to be because these ones
they<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.740> they<00:02:53.160> don't<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.400> any<00:02:53.520> batteries

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
they just they don't have any batteries

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.820 
they just they don't have any batteries
or<00:02:53.910> anything<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.360> wires<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.650> there's

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
or anything it's just wires so there's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.080 
or anything it's just wires so there's
no<00:02:55.920> need<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.460> one<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.910> one

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
