00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.730
 and we're going to go to privacy and in 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.650
 advertising we give in the reset 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.869

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.420

 and when you restart your phone you will not have 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.859
 nothing absolutely nothing more than 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.650

 good after doing that 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.180
 we open the play store that in this case 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.560

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.200
 it's going to erase everything you're going to lose everything 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.940

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.269
 zip point 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.500
 after selecting it they will 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.060
 it seems that they are going to restart the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.500
 Cell you will accept them 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.350
 reboot the cell phone will load 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.880
 something 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.980
 something like when they are downloading 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.770
 you can download now after loading 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.889
 that is going to restart the cell phone 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.889
 and they're going and they're going to stay the round 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.560
 well already entered the rom 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.090
 and you are going to have the applications 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.090
 download the roe manager again 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.970
 they go back to dig in raw managers 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.030
 Very good 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.760

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.730
 video description 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.770
 and they install it on the cell phone because I think 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.690
 that application is lost 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.770
 and when they open the menu and if they see there another 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.440
 Well, it's been this since we opened it 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.730

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.760

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.570
 rounds of the headquarters 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.820
 from headquarters and now we select the 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.920
 bird file 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.100
 accept because they're going to restart the 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.660

 be installed the rom with the plays thor 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.710

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.630

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.790
 appears the logo said the remote ones but 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.610
 After that, that place does not pass 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.420
 pixel to the screen watch a video 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.760
