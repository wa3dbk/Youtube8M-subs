00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.600 

to<00:01:50.270> create<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.750> more<00:01:50.900> tousled<00:01:51.440> wave<00:01:51.620> and<00:01:51.980> take

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
to create the more tousled wave and take

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.240 
to create the more tousled wave and take
in<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.180> percy<00:01:53.900> emery<00:01:54.170> dry<00:01:54.500> conditioner<00:01:55.070> and
