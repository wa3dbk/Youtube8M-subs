good for painting so I then run it into

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.969 
good for painting so I then run it into
this<00:01:52.439> tank<00:01:52.970> which<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.000> my<00:01:54.299> old<00:01:54.479> compressor<00:01:55.470> but

this tank which is my old compressor but
the<00:01:56.189> compressor<00:01:56.880> died<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.439> passes<00:01:58.860> through

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the compressor died so it passes through

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.499 
the compressor died so it passes through
a<00:01:59.759> filter<00:02:00.360> first<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.920> sort<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.909> oil<00:02:03.090> any

down<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:21.239> know<00:02:21.680> 60<00:02:22.680> psi<00:02:23.569> then<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.690> falls

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
down to you know 60 psi then it falls

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.220 
down to you know 60 psi then it falls
this<00:02:25.290> hole<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:25.920> blue<00:02:26.160> hose<00:02:26.400> into<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
another second filter so that will dry

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.870 
another second filter so that will dry
the<00:02:33.959> air<00:02:34.230> even<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> micro

the air even more and then a micro
pressure<00:02:38.880> regulator<00:02:39.420> where<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:40.019> dial<00:02:40.560> it

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
pressure regulator where I can dial it

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.740 
pressure regulator where I can dial it
down<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.690> play<00:02:43.620> between<00:02:43.950> 20<00:02:44.790> pounds<00:02:45.569> per

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
down but to play between 20 pounds per

down but to play between 20 pounds per
square<00:02:45.780> inch<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.780> lessen<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.040> pressure<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.519> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
square inch to lessen the pressure if I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.009 
square inch to lessen the pressure if I
want<00:02:50.850> while<00:02:51.060> I'm<00:02:51.239> airbrushing<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:51.989> a

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
want while I'm airbrushing and then a

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:00.500 
want while I'm airbrushing and then a
quick<00:02:52.319> connect<00:02:52.680> hose<00:02:53.640> right<00:02:54.299> here<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:59.510> the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
quick connect hose right here to the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.390 
quick connect hose right here to the
airbrush<00:03:01.280> then<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:02.489> work<00:03:02.519> top<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.280> as

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
airbrush then my work top so I think as

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.430 
airbrush then my work top so I think as
far<00:03:05.610> as<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:06.000> air<00:03:06.239> supply<00:03:06.480> goes<00:03:07.019> from<00:03:07.290> my

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
far as an air supply goes from my

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.309 
far as an air supply goes from my
airbrush<00:03:07.739> I've<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.190> everything<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.910> need<00:03:09.120> I

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
airbrush I've got everything I need I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.410 
airbrush I've got everything I need I
got<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.530> I've<00:03:10.799> definitely<00:03:11.130> got<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.549> PSI<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
got the I've definitely got the PSI and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.699 
got the I've definitely got the PSI and
the<00:03:13.349> storage<00:03:13.739> capacity<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:15.120> day<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.620> know

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709

the storage capacity for a day you know
a<00:03:16.739> lot<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.570> painting<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:19.590> think<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.220> know
