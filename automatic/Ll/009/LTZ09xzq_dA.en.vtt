00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 so on training st aggression guys 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 before you tint photos buy 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.920
 yourself a good monitor because it is possible to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.480
 first so toned that good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 the monitor itself looks it will be 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 It looks just awful and that's all 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
 if you are going to process 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 photos of wedding top any this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.930
 need a monitor with and see because 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:33.590
 I will now reveal to you the photos which 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 did on the laptop see colors just 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 Tin and photo good all as would 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 dynamics are all well here but this acid is like 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.660
 like this photographer mushrooms okay if 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 you still decide to tint an example then 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 I think you better create an action 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.640
 how to create action action possible in 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.719
 principle create for any action 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 if you understand that you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 perform the same action 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 constantly so that on each photo not 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.420
 suffer you can create an action go to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.960
 action such a triangle click here 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:24.340
 here we write a new set for example 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.320
 coaching can actually be this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.530
 do more like fast I don't know 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.979
 how to make faster i do that and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.609
 shouting tobora click them again 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.439
 here 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:41.350
 when the cream over here but the appetite operation 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.569
 can call training with this 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.130
 burn appear red which 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.000
 circle that is your drive starts 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.020
 write down 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.369
 this toner photo for example to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 create a new layer 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:03.299
 now let's fill it with some color 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.299
 select the Paint Bucket Tool fill it with 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.590
 some 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 we put it in such color 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.569
 mixing layers of exclusion is all about us 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:23.200
 Canada toned such as usual on 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.120
 instagram can be seen here further on 5 mb 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.329
 millet and click on the square and that is 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.959
 stop it so it doesn't save 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.910
 Now we have a training session 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.190
 if i decide to also train another 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 photo I click on the photo click 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.260
 training and the triangle again at the bottom 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.599
 me toned 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.120
 automatically this training will repeat 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.230
 that any kind of action can be 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.750
 save in action 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.930
 I hope you understand how to do it. 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 really just saves time 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.799
 so what I haven't told you yet 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.340
 have not yet told that if suddenly you 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.220
 took a good picture but no 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.019
 there are problems defined as here 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.310
 i.e 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.209
 insufficient volume very flat light 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.590
 do it so that the volume is more 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.159
 less normal again look 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.349
 create a duplicate layer so I generally 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.680
 writing 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:35.329
 I will finish it perfectly 2 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.870
 black and white correction black 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:43.639
 white red drag left 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:47.060
 so much contrast kei and create again 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.430
 new layer go edit run 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.430
 fill 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.030
 fill in 50 percent gray and set 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.010
 blending layers on a soft light further we 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.810
 take a brush lightening set and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.819
 forty percent now I won't say that 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.290
 we need less than the percentage we need dreams 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.290
 just without the giants of time 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.400
 draw light areas 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.400
 night draw 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.889
 network here are the black specks too so 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.480
 choose so here these black areas 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:38.669
 a good general is really needed 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.669
 remove these black things 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.890
 well we dropped off a little bosom 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.280
 nulled on the news 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.640
 next we press the alt button and 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.030
 lighter becomes darkening while 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:03.040
 obscure don't know how to give 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:06.370
 however these places I am not from la rena 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.110
 larin golok so I won't tell you exactly 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.470
 Well, in general, then the world duck with us. 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.700
 make eye makeup dim 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.700
 boredom necessarily 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.670
 and the facial contour is good 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.600
 Tell me why I did it off 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.490
 black white layer and see what we have 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.380
 it turned out cut drawing is very hard 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.500
 so my percentage decreases 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.600
 up to 30 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.980
 here comes kata beach cretin 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.980
 photos are closer now. 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.440
 doing this in extreme cases at the very 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.850
 try to take off right away and the poor 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.530
 photos are very cool this technique is owned 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.330
 professional professional address 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.060
 retoucher they can even redraw 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.280
 all light but it takes a lot 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.690
 time and since and says that 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.970
 photos do not need to spend more 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.950
 two or three minutes then this reception is only 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.630
 can accept then when you understand 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.630
 what a good picture but not enough volume 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.170
 so but all the donor I have to run already 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.160
 bay swim on speech wave 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.370
 I think you enough information and 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.960
 forgot to show how to install action 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.050
 Look here at what our action 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.140
 let's give you now, too, for example 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.880
 training we still save click here 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:42.030
 save the operation again to the desktop 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.560
 and saving where all delete just 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:48.960
 and now I will send you an action on 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:55.230
 sharpness to put it click 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:58.320
 wards all up we choose load operations 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.570
 and from the desktop choose download 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.090
 all this so it appeared but here it is 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.640
 works 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:10.350
 work i guys on adobe camera raw 7 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:14.240
 so if well, that is, and fix 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:17.400
 rights and in adobe cs6 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.100
 Photoshop itself so if you donâ€™t 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.750
 will these plugins put in there plugin 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.850
 these settings get up for these other 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.909
 Photoshop and guys means doing something not 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:31.419
