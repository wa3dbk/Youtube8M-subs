 final and now you break connection the series 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.320

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.050
 precious stones or times as you wish 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.079
 call him from kristen and erc is ruby ​​sapphire 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.270
 and emerald not know I quite liked me 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.150
 liked it very much after saffirio was like 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:07.150
 more a month and emerald was already like 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.250
 the second song is red and it's a book 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.260
 that the red cover choose and animals 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.890
 fantastic and they will find the damage 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.020
 that they 're going that red rowling of the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.390
 cover is red gives a riot or evenings 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.160
 of songs you took and it's a book that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.340
 It makes you feel nostalgic which I want 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.420
 write here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.759
 enough nostalgia and that's also 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.649
 A lot of the next song is love story 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.929
 It is a book of forbidden love and I chose 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.549
 he forgets in this habit his sum not yet 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.460
 I read this book but I think everyone 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.950
 we know that this is a love story 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.289
 culturally forbidden the fifth 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.119
 song is a new world work and the 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.939
 slogan is a bad character that we 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.829
 will avoid more and my choice is lucas 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.439
 tachan of the series of profiles and action 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.450
 rick riordan who did not have is not 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.450
 good if it's bad but 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.909
 what guys the sixth song is innocent 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.750
 that we never listen and it's a book that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.750
 there is in the field at the end 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.450

 the last songs griffin jazz times 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.140
 and it's a book whose character you have 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.360
 a lot of development and my choice was his 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.940
 Leader of the series already ended tájar amav 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.480
 and juliette changes so much since it's over 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.680
 and night milk, the change is incredible 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.409
 of that character is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.299
 the eighth song is you belong with me 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.609
 and it is a book that is waiting 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.609
 eagerly to come out and obviously 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.510

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.590

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.900
 a book that is in them and lend it 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.860

 unless I offer you you have no no no 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.959

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.060
 instants why 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.800
 I am an emotional and sensitive person myself 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.570
 not enough with books but one of 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.060
 the ones that made me cry the most 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.160

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.670

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 legend as I cry and with this book God 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.040
 if you read this book I think you know in 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.349
 what parts where and the last song is 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.110
