00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
computer to sleep I personally wouldn't

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.590 
computer to sleep I personally wouldn't
do<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:12.890> because<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.210> because

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
do that because you know I don't because

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.990 
do that because you know I don't because
it's<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.409> don't<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.520> like

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it's I don't know I just don't like

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
it's I don't know I just don't like
putting<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> into<00:01:18.689> sleep<00:01:18.930> mode<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:20.310> what

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
putting it into sleep mode and then what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
putting it into sleep mode and then what
you<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.720> adjust<00:01:22.259> your

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you want to do is just adjust your

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.870 
you want to do is just adjust your
brightness<00:01:22.790> so<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.330> too<00:01:24.600> bright

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
brightness so it's not too bright

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.850 
brightness so it's not too bright
because<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.360> brightness<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because the brightness will use a lot of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.260 
because the brightness will use a lot of
the<00:01:29.070> battery<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the battery so you're going to want to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
the battery so you're going to want to
keep<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.509> brightness<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> bare<00:01:31.500> minimum

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
keep your brightness on the bare minimum

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.670 
keep your brightness on the bare minimum
it<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.630> once<00:01:33.810> you've<00:01:34.020> done<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.290> just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it can be so once you've done that just

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.039 
it can be so once you've done that just
hit<00:01:34.890> Save<00:01:35.130> Changes<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.720> exit

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
hit Save Changes and then we can exit

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
hit Save Changes and then we can exit
that<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> next<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.360> next<00:01:39.360> tip<00:01:39.479> I'm

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that now the next one we next tip I'm

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.609 
that now the next one we next tip I'm
going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> show<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:41.840> I'm<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.380> be

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
going to show you is I'm going to be

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.980 
going to show you is I'm going to be
we're<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.670> limiting<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.509> amount<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we're going to be limiting the amount of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
we're going to be limiting the amount of
startup<00:01:46.470> processes<00:01:47.040> started<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
startup processes started on the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
startup processes started on the
computer<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> reason<00:01:48.810> why<00:01:48.930> we're<00:01:49.140> going

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
computer now the reason why we're going

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.219 
computer now the reason why we're going
to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.149> limit<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to do this is because if we limit the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.770 
to do this is because if we limit the
startup<00:01:52.799> processes<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.850> computer<00:01:54.390> battery

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
startup processes the computer battery

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.830 
startup processes the computer battery
you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> work<00:01:56.240> not<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.360> hard<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you have to work not as hard on the

you have to work not as hard on the

when<00:02:39.670> starting<00:02:40.269> up<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:40.720> else<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.769> could<00:02:42.190> cause

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
when starting up or else it could cause

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.420 
when starting up or else it could cause
system<00:02:42.940> errors<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.480> stuff<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:44.470> most<00:02:45.280> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
system errors and stuff but most of

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.509 
system errors and stuff but most of
stuff<00:02:45.670> should<00:02:46.030> disable<00:02:47.160> apart<00:02:48.160> from<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> only

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
stuff should disable apart from the only

another tip for you we are going to

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.520 
another tip for you we are going to
disable<00:03:16.690> all<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.440> flashy<00:03:17.799> themes<00:03:18.190> in

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
disable all of the flashy themes in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.819 
disable all of the flashy themes in
Windows<00:03:20.530> now<00:03:21.959> basically<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.680> is

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
Windows now basically this is this is

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.509 
Windows now basically this is this is
probably<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> most<00:03:24.549> effective<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.980> used<00:03:26.980> now

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
probably the most effective one used now

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.319 
probably the most effective one used now
at<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> moment<00:03:28.419> I've<00:03:28.720> found<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:31.209> it

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
at the moment I've found and what it

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.920 
at the moment I've found and what it
does<00:03:31.569> is<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.609> basically<00:03:33.609> yeah<00:03:34.209> just<00:03:34.450> disables

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
does is it basically yeah just disables

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.020 
does is it basically yeah just disables
all<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.260> animations<00:03:35.950> all<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.340> flashy<00:03:36.639> themes

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
all the animations all the flashy themes

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.809 
all the animations all the flashy themes
all<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.810> like<00:03:38.169> stuff<00:03:39.069> that<00:03:39.099> makes<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.669> look

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
all the like stuff that makes it look

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.420 
all the like stuff that makes it look
nice<00:03:40.530> because<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.799> has<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:42.099> use<00:03:42.220> like

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
nice because it has to use like

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.059 
nice because it has to use like
additional<00:03:42.940> CPU<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.690> RAM<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:44.260> process<00:03:44.799> them

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
additional CPU and RAM to process them

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.000 
additional CPU and RAM to process them
