 You, the pirate who weaves this treacherous sea, taught me 

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:16.881
 how to lead a free life and leave this world ... with honor. 

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:26.854
 These pirates were found guilty of theft, betrayal and murder ... 

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.821
 and were sentenced to hang by the neck until death. 

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.707
 He'll execute me in the morning, Edward. 

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:41.387
 But they never get you. 

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.466
 All hands on the stern, boys! We're leaving home! 

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.047
 Just once you were interested in gold ... 

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:57.364
 I want to taste a decent life. Easy life. 

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:01.538
 Your courage ... is now a nightmare for the empire. 

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:06.183
 When one plays a fool, he can only convince the fool. 

00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:10.968
 But if he looks like a devil, then all of you. 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.072
 ... and the kings and queens curse your name. 

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:27.312
 Resist them ... by being free. 

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:33.852
 I will not live to see the world you are shaping ... 

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.587
 ... but I know it will be better. 

00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:40.639
 Everyone at their places! To the guns! 

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:45.500
 Let's hear this beast's roar! 

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.286
 Send them to hell!
