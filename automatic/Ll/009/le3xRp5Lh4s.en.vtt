by<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> way<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.730> will<00:00:23.789> happen<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
by the way because what will happen is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.689 
by the way because what will happen is
since<00:00:24.990> Diddy's<00:00:25.380> more<00:00:25.769> nimble<00:00:26.130> than<00:00:26.189> Donkey

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
since Diddy's more nimble than Donkey

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
since Diddy's more nimble than Donkey
Kong<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.240> know<00:00:27.330> he'll<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> easier<00:00:28.109> check

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Kong you know he'll have it easier check

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.429 
Kong you know he'll have it easier check
easier<00:00:28.980> time<00:00:29.340> dodging<00:00:29.730> things<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.199> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
easier time dodging things so if you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
easier time dodging things so if you
lose<00:00:31.650> Donkey<00:00:32.130> Kong<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:32.790> doesn't
