00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
trio was their first since 1995 so I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
trio was their first since 1995 so I
think<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.270> game<00:01:30.659> dominated

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
think that we will see a game dominated

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.980 
think that we will see a game dominated
by<00:01:31.380> uruguay<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:33.119> should<00:01:33.360> seek<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> funny

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
his male number one in attack because of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.249

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
am mean it was a year ago I when ever I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
am mean it was a year ago I when ever I
don't<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.200> Jamaica<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> gonna<00:01:47.070> make<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
don't think I Jamaica is gonna make it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
don't think I Jamaica is gonna make it
easy<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> lean<00:01:49.470> towards<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
easy for them are you lean towards a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.200 
easy for them are you lean towards a
high<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> low<00:01:50.790> scoring<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:52.759> exactly<00:01:53.759> are

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
high or a low scoring game exactly are

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
high or a low scoring game exactly are
you<00:01:54.329> set<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> beginning<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.430> tough

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you set from the beginning it's a tough

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.510 
you set from the beginning it's a tough
group<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.960> Uruguay<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
group also for Uruguay so I think that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.050 
group also for Uruguay so I think that
this<00:02:00.210> game<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.950> rest<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> games

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this game from all the rest of the games

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.230 
this game from all the rest of the games
should<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> easy<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:06.000> should

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
should be the easy one and they should

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
should be the easy one and they should

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
to score 2.25 which is quite a

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.989 
to score 2.25 which is quite a
difference<00:02:25.019> there<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.439> know<00:02:25.739> which<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.189> 1.67

will<00:02:27.569> we<00:02:27.719> see<00:02:27.900> goals<00:02:28.139> from<00:02:28.349> both<00:02:28.590> sides<00:02:28.889> I

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
will we see goals from both sides I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.970 
will we see goals from both sides I
think<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.319> best<00:02:31.530> question

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
think that this is the best question

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.059 
think that this is the best question
game<00:02:32.400> Jamaica<00:02:32.939> score<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.480> match<00:02:33.689> and<00:02:34.069> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
game Jamaica score in this match and I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.250 
game Jamaica score in this match and I
think<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.639> we<00:02:36.209> might<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.689> guns<00:02:36.959> from<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
think that we might see guns from the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.250 
think that we might see guns from the
record<00:02:37.680> voice<00:02:37.859> and<00:02:38.159> that<00:02:38.879> will<00:02:39.299> show<00:02:39.510> us<00:02:39.719> that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
record voice and that will show us that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.259 
record voice and that will show us that
they<00:02:40.439> can<00:02:40.650> play<00:02:40.950> good<00:02:41.310> also<00:02:41.700> against<00:02:42.090> big

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
they can play good also against big

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.589 
they can play good also against big

will be hard for Jamaica to score

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.990 
will be hard for Jamaica to score
against<00:03:00.419> the<00:03:00.540> white<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.349> we<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.579> can<00:03:02.819> see
