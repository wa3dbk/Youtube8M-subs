 under his fingernails is always one 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.910
 little dirt when he comes back he 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.000
 is not shorter prince he is one 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.369
 Dirty in the sense that dirt 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.200
 and he is part of his physical one 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.390
 and mental life are the prince of 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.130
 wales had a vision he wanted too 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.520
 Organic agriculture around dispute 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 so came here 24 years ago one asks 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.000
 me in the interview if I am 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.829
 would be biologically sustainable 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.839
 agriculture I tried to try 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.609
 not really what that means but me 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.050
 of course said yes it was finally 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.350
 a job interview there one says 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 always 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.210
 david is a remarkable human being I 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.819
 have the luck to have someone who 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 is so compassionate and believes in what 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.159
 I want to reach 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.159
 write it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.400
 until 11 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.980
 fix is 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.720
 so we can not go ahead 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:11.290
 but nothing returns a healthy one 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.120
 Creating the ground is the a and o we 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.280
 have to realize that we ourselves too 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.510
 part of nature and not separated 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 exist of her 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.980
 but many are exactly in this belief 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.390
 grew up 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.340
 I am very happy that I landed here 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.620
 am and an agriculture system 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.940
 It can be very different 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.940
 than I could before 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.100
 at the lucky innerhofer I have 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 good luck this home farm too 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.130
 have 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.219
 i can illustrate something 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.200
 and also experiment and hopefully 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.590
 away that also interest in other such 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 wish
