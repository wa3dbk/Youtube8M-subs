00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hey i want to show you today how to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 can cut in stages or in general 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.940
 cut on the tips 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.080
 For me it is mainly now 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.820
 so to align my tips something 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.920
 but I show you accordingly in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.199
 a step as you yourself 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 stepless can that is relative 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.720
 simple and is at least one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.590
 then be a little bit harder 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.480
 some also have a lot of hair I have done 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 and then of course that's one 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 bit difficult i wear the hairstyle 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 not because I really like that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.050
 but I have one myself 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.579
 bit researched me read through 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 and there you will find this method 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.960
 I've got that already now two 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.610
 tried it out and would like that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 Just show it because I love the idea 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 located and it is also relatively easy 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 goes fast 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.059
 when I did the last time I 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.620
 I'm about as much of the reason 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.210
 also lost my hair 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 still up to the hip and yes if 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 you are interested then stay like 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 tuned 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.330
 First of all, you have to braid yourself here 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 Do it on the head as well 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.220
 i say that now i feel like this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.409
 a bit like in the nineties 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.409
 a fountain on the pear 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.130
 So that's why I already have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.770
 I have to start what I do not have to think 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.460
 just show a bit from the back 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.440
 and brush up strongly in front 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.479
 that you jump here on the worms 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.670
 and then at least I do it that way 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.130
 I have my hair down here in the lengths 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.490
 to damp because then easy 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.990
 a bit better leave 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.119
 and for that I just take each one now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 trace of Schwarzkopf and me here 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:14.519
 first to the length because you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.420
 then comb through it very knowledgeable 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.200
 I have to take this for a professional 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.200
 urges isa 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:45.810
 and now you actually get the samples 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.810
 you can go through that again 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.400
 the most important is of course one 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.880
 hair trimmer heavy take for it no 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.890
 baste scissors 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.489
 now signs off immediately with me because 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.489
 here all you really tight hold of 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 firmly 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:24.030
 so that I am on a length and then 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:28.510
 you can see that all of them are down here 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.200
 I take the same length 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.200
 me just the ferries and cut 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:48.610
 this just cuts something 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:51.520
 Of course, get it yourself 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.520
 want to cut stages then you take 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.150
 simply for your reason so long 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.880
 ideally that is if you 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.620
 uniformly long hair took then 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:12.780
 your head and then go 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:18.989
 just until then where you have the length 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.989
 Here I go again a bit 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.770
 what you could open that one 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.620
 to shake off that they are there 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.520
 just so provocatively a bit small 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.500
 to cut 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.500
 if I'm personally more beautiful if that one 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.690
 bit squeamish is as I said before 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.479
 my hair was on a length and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.830
 I have twice the substances and 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.349
 here below 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.000
 I'll open my wife first 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.500
 so that everyone maybe in the open 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.020
 condition to be able to see better 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:59.080
 So these are my hair already 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.300
 lace cut minimal and a 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.130
 a little bit of fear is calling you here 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.840
 maybe you can see 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.680
 I do not know it higher 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.090
 because I do not like it that much 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.639
 if you find yourself somehow 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.340
 hairstyle makes he the hair so there 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.710
 rom make well but here you see them 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.060
 get a little shorter 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.190
 if you liked the video should 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.139
 Of course I would like to leave an abo 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.740
 I would be very happy everywhere 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.539
 looking forward 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.979
 and then I hope that we join 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.979
 next video bye bye
