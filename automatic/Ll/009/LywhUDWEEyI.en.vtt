got it off doesn't really know its story
it<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.250> given<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> him<00:00:14.730> by<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> friend<00:00:15.199> so

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
it was just given to him by a friend so

who<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> hell<00:00:17.400> knows<00:00:17.820> what's<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.570> all

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
who the hell knows what's up with it all

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
who the hell knows what's up with it all
I<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.770> its<00:00:19.920> brand<00:00:20.070> new<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.330> has<00:00:21.480> been

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I know is its brand new like it has been

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.990 
I know is its brand new like it has been
on<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> car<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.100> pulled<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> off<00:00:23.609> shortly

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
on a car but they pulled it off shortly

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400 
on a car but they pulled it off shortly
afterwards<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.720> something<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.109> going

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
afterwards because something was going

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
afterwards because something was going
on<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.189> guessing<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
on and guessing it's to do with the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.710 
on and guessing it's to do with the
silly<00:00:27.449> one-way<00:00:27.900> clutch<00:00:28.670> which<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.240> bit

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
silly one-way clutch which is a bit

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.229 
silly one-way clutch which is a bit
unnecessary<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:32.340> there's<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> proper<00:00:32.880> one-way

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
unnecessary but there's a proper one-way

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
unnecessary but there's a proper one-way
clutch<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> thing<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.980> still<00:00:35.250> go

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
clutch on that thing and they still go

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.940 
clutch on that thing and they still go
bad<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.820> starts<00:00:36.210> howling<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.320> carrying<00:00:37.770> on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
bad and starts howling and carrying on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.850 
bad and starts howling and carrying on
when<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> goes<00:00:40.200> into<00:00:40.379> freewheel

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
when the when it goes into freewheel

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.889 
when the when it goes into freewheel
mode<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.520> howl<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.059> squeal<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> carry

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
mode they can howl and squeal and carry

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.670 
mode they can howl and squeal and carry
on<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.120> we'll<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.750> happens<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.289> just

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
on so we'll see what happens when I just

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
on so we'll see what happens when I just
ran<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> normal<00:00:47.250> electric<00:00:47.879> motor<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
ran it off a normal electric motor I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
ran it off a normal electric motor I
can't<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:48.780> test<00:00:49.200> proper<00:00:49.620> vehicle

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
can't actually test proper vehicle

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.650 
can't actually test proper vehicle
driving<00:00:50.399> conditions<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:52.039> so

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
driving conditions as it is so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
driving conditions as it is so
everything's<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.809> together<00:00:55.020> again

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
everything's back together again

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.369 
everything's back together again

maybe five or ten miles before they

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.410 
maybe five or ten miles before they

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
decided to can it I'm gonna drive it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
decided to can it I'm gonna drive it

one<00:01:11.310> came<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> Jag<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.450> before<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
one came out of the Jag just before I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
one came out of the Jag just before I
got<00:01:12.900> rid<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.890> had<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.220> charge

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
got rid of it and I've had it on charge

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
got rid of it and I've had it on charge
for<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.360> hours<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.710> showing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
for about two hours so it's showing

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.200 
for about two hours so it's showing
voltage<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.670> probably<00:01:17.909> isn't<00:01:18.030> much

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
voltage but it probably isn't much

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.289 
voltage but it probably isn't much
current<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:20.000> should<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> interesting

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
current in it and should be interesting

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
excites it's like a woman you've got to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.149 
excites it's like a woman you've got to
tickle<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.649> way

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
tickle it the right way

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.510 
tickle it the right way
not<00:01:44.399> too<00:01:44.579> hard<00:01:44.820> though<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.270> burn<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> out

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
not too hard though or you burn it out

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
not too hard though or you burn it out
so<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> put<00:01:47.970> straight<00:01:48.630> 12-volt<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
so if you put straight 12-volt from the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
so if you put straight 12-volt from the
battery<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.040> exciter<00:01:50.399> you'll<00:01:50.670> damage<00:01:51.420> or

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
battery to the exciter you'll damage or

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
battery to the exciter you'll damage or
destroy<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> alternator<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.369> you've<00:01:53.579> got<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
destroy the alternator so you've got to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.780 
destroy the alternator so you've got to
run<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> through<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.180> 5<00:01:54.450> watt<00:01:54.780> lamp<00:01:55.219> not<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.369> LED

actually want a proper 5 watt
incandescent<00:02:01.020> lamp<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> we're<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.689> hooked<00:02:03.930> up

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079

cannot<00:02:13.940> controlling<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.290> one<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.620> has

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
cannot controlling it this one just has

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.570 
cannot controlling it this one just has
exciter<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.900> B+<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.320> obviously<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> case<00:02:19.310> is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
exciter and B+ and obviously the case is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.450 
exciter and B+ and obviously the case is
negative<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.810> battery<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.350> negative<00:02:22.190> clamp

negative to battery and negative clamp

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.130 
negative to battery and negative clamp
just<00:02:22.550> go<00:02:22.790> straight<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> table<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
just go straight to the table so the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.500 
just go straight to the table so the
whole<00:02:24.380> tables<00:02:24.800> battery<00:02:25.100> negative<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
whole tables battery negative the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.180 
whole tables battery negative the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
battery positives coming off here

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.070

so<00:02:28.460> that's<00:02:28.640> main<00:02:28.880> charging<00:02:29.360> amps<00:02:29.630> output<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
so that's main charging amps output to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.170 
so that's main charging amps output to
them<00:02:30.200> through<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> meter<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.910> straight

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
them through the meter it's a straight

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.470

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
which is this wire here so it's spin it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.190 
which is this wire here so it's spin it
up<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.560> see<00:02:39.680> what<00:02:39.800> happens

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.589

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.050 
from this but the alternator will start
whining<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.700> working<00:02:58.790> once<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.879> get<00:02:59.970> the

we<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.800> in<00:03:04.800> here

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.140 

that's<00:03:11.540> bad

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.589 

like<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.930> multimeter<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.650> pretty<00:03:16.860> good

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.869 

it's<00:03:23.500> correct<00:03:24.900> optimum<00:03:25.900> charging<00:03:26.560> amps

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.390 

not<00:03:30.569> even<00:03:30.870> spinning<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.379> fast<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:32.040> motors

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
at almost 50 Hertz so fourteen hundred

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.970

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.929 
cruising speed on some of these cars
that's<00:03:42.840> quite<00:03:43.079> good<00:03:43.109> actually<00:03:43.730> they're<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
that's quite good actually they're to

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.520 
that's quite good actually they're to
spin<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.450> nuts<00:03:45.629> off<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.409> do

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
spin the nuts off it to get it to do

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.910 
spin the nuts off it to get it to do
anything

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.570 

so<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:51.880> does<00:03:52.030> work<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.650> believe<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.950> may<00:03:54.220> be<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
so it does work I believe it may be the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.440 
so it does work I believe it may be the
one-way<00:03:55.420> clutch<00:03:55.720> squeals<00:03:56.260> if<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.500> suddenly

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
one-way clutch squeals if you suddenly

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.630 
one-way clutch squeals if you suddenly
decelerate<00:03:58.450> or<00:03:58.480> stopped<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.050> engine

fourteen point three fourteen point four

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.430 
fourteen point three fourteen point four
that's<00:04:07.220> fine<00:04:07.490> if<00:04:08.210> you<00:04:08.360> go<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.510> 15<00:04:09.020> volts<00:04:09.050> are

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
that's fine if you go to 15 volts are

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.690 
that's fine if you go to 15 volts are

my<00:05:05.030> tits<00:05:05.240> not<00:05:05.389> really<00:05:05.660> writer<00:05:05.900> for<00:05:06.199> that

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.240 

nothing<00:05:12.750> on<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> made<00:05:13.140> on<00:05:13.320> Bailey<00:05:13.770> taking

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
nothing on the made on Bailey taking

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.040 
nothing on the made on Bailey taking
anything

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.840 

yeah<00:05:22.500> these<00:05:22.710> motors<00:05:23.160> aren't<00:05:23.310> really<00:05:23.580> rated

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
yeah these motors aren't really rated

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.660 
yeah these motors aren't really rated
for<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.210> kind<00:05:24.420> of<00:05:24.540> speed<00:05:24.840> or<00:05:25.050> frequency<00:05:25.670> but

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
for that kind of speed or frequency but

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.930 
for that kind of speed or frequency but
then<00:05:26.880> vague<00:05:27.150> do<00:05:27.390> make<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.660> nice<00:05:27.900> motor<00:05:28.940> it's

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
then vague do make a nice motor it's

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.580 
then vague do make a nice motor it's
made<00:05:30.150> in<00:05:30.270> Brazil

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.180 

and<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.550> voltage<00:05:36.180> remains<00:05:36.450> stable<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:38.010> does

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
and the voltage remains stable it does

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.710 
and the voltage remains stable it does
drop<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.460> little<00:05:38.670> bit<00:05:38.910> it'll<00:05:39.330> dropped<00:05:39.600> about

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
drop a little bit it'll dropped about

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.200 
drop a little bit it'll dropped about
13.8<00:05:40.680> or<00:05:40.890> something<00:05:41.220> if<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.520> gets<00:05:41.670> really<00:05:41.880> hot

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
13.8 or something if it gets really hot

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.770 
13.8 or something if it gets really hot
and<00:05:43.110> that's<00:05:43.260> typical<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.830> them

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.270 

you<00:05:51.290> actually<00:05:51.410> hear<00:05:51.650> more<00:05:51.830> noise<00:05:52.010> from<00:05:52.040> the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
you actually hear more noise from the

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.660 
you actually hear more noise from the
motor<00:05:52.520> now<00:05:52.820> it's<00:05:53.090> laboring<00:05:54.430> they<00:05:55.430> all<00:05:55.520> know

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
motor now it's laboring they all know

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.060 
motor now it's laboring they all know
it's<00:05:55.850> not<00:05:55.940> getting<00:05:56.150> warm<00:05:56.980> regulators<00:05:57.980> are

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
it's not getting warm regulators are

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.440 
it's not getting warm regulators are
people<00:05:58.280> home<00:05:59.020> but<00:06:00.020> still<00:06:01.450> diodes<00:06:02.450> are<00:06:02.660> cold

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
people home but still diodes are cold

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.620 
people home but still diodes are cold
yeah<00:06:05.710> rectifier<00:06:06.710> diodes<00:06:07.220> are<00:06:07.340> cold<00:06:07.580> not<00:06:08.480> sure

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
yeah rectifier diodes are cold not sure

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.000 
yeah rectifier diodes are cold not sure
what<00:06:08.810> voltage<00:06:09.170> comes<00:06:09.440> off<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.680> windings

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
what voltage comes off the windings

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.160 
what voltage comes off the windings
themselves<00:06:10.490> but<00:06:10.640> it<00:06:10.730> can't<00:06:10.880> be<00:06:10.970> that<00:06:11.090> high<00:06:11.300> if

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
themselves but it can't be that high if

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.360 
themselves but it can't be that high if
it<00:06:12.290> is<00:06:12.410> I'll<00:06:12.560> know<00:06:12.710> about<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:13.360> is<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:15.370> it's

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
it is I'll know about it is that it's

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.190 
it is I'll know about it is that it's
three-phase<00:06:17.000> alternating<00:06:17.120> current<00:06:18.020> going

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
three-phase alternating current going

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.040 
three-phase alternating current going
through<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.590> rectifier<00:06:19.070> to<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:20.390> regulator

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
through the rectifier to the regulator

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.830 
through the rectifier to the regulator
and<00:06:21.260> everything<00:06:21.530> it<00:06:21.620> comes<00:06:21.860> out<00:06:22.040> as<00:06:22.220> a<00:06:22.250> normal

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
and everything it comes out as a normal

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:32.360 
and everything it comes out as a normal
straight<00:06:23.840> DC<00:06:24.380> output

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.840 

yeah<00:06:32.940> it's<00:06:33.720> nothing<00:06:33.840> upload<00:06:34.610> I'm<00:06:35.610> gonna<00:06:35.760> have

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
yeah it's nothing upload I'm gonna have

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.220 
yeah it's nothing upload I'm gonna have
to<00:06:35.910> add<00:06:36.000> some<00:06:36.060> load<00:06:36.389> to<00:06:36.570> this<00:06:36.690> and<00:06:36.870> see<00:06:36.990> what<00:06:37.110> it

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
to add some load to this and see what it

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.080 
to add some load to this and see what it
does

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
does

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.280 
does
the<00:06:39.090> motors<00:06:39.419> making<00:06:39.570> more<00:06:39.840> noise<00:06:40.020> than<00:06:40.050> the

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
the motors making more noise than the

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.719 
the motors making more noise than the
alternator<00:06:40.710> but<00:06:40.979> if<00:06:41.070> I<00:06:41.160> put<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.430> under<00:06:41.669> a

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
alternator but if I put that under a

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.670 
alternator but if I put that under a
shitload<00:06:42.060> of<00:06:42.240> load<00:06:42.600> they'll<00:06:43.199> probably<00:06:43.350> start

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
shitload of load they'll probably start

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.700 
shitload of load they'll probably start
slipping<00:06:44.070> the<00:06:44.160> belt<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:45.380> howling<00:06:46.380> its<00:06:46.530> head

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
slipping the belt and howling its head

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.010 
slipping the belt and howling its head
off<00:06:48.770> anywho

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
off anywho

00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:06.210 
off anywho
I'll<00:06:51.410> set<00:06:51.680> up<00:06:51.710> a<00:06:51.830> light<00:06:52.039> later

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.610 

voltage<00:07:07.220> is<00:07:07.250> up<00:07:07.460> a<00:07:07.550> bit<00:07:08.020> but<00:07:09.020> it's<00:07:09.349> mainly<00:07:09.530> just

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
voltage is up a bit but it's mainly just

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.010 
voltage is up a bit but it's mainly just
cranking<00:07:10.190> amps<00:07:10.430> into<00:07:10.580> that<00:07:10.789> battery<00:07:11.180> it<00:07:11.840> does

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
cranking amps into that battery it does

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.100 
cranking amps into that battery it does
need<00:07:12.199> a<00:07:12.229> really<00:07:12.530> good<00:07:12.680> charge<00:07:13.569> so<00:07:14.569> I'll<00:07:14.990> let

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
need a really good charge so I'll let

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.550 
need a really good charge so I'll let
this<00:07:15.259> run<00:07:15.500> for<00:07:15.650> a<00:07:15.710> bit<00:07:15.800> longer<00:07:16.039> and<00:07:17.379> set<00:07:18.379> up<00:07:18.470> a

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
this run for a bit longer and set up a

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.890 
this run for a bit longer and set up a
load<00:07:18.800> maybe<00:07:19.159> we'll<00:07:19.819> try<00:07:20.000> introducing<00:07:20.479> a

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
load maybe we'll try introducing a

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.110 
load maybe we'll try introducing a
couple<00:07:21.199> of<00:07:21.289> radiator<00:07:21.770> fans<00:07:22.120> that'll

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
couple of radiator fans that'll

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.899 
couple of radiator fans that'll
definitely<00:07:23.270> slip<00:07:23.990> the<00:07:24.110> belt<00:07:24.639> I'll<00:07:25.639> be<00:07:25.729> too

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:25.909 
definitely slip the belt I'll be too

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.210 
definitely slip the belt I'll be too
much<00:07:26.060> amperage<00:07:26.360> even<00:07:27.050> single<00:07:27.379> radiator<00:07:27.919> fan

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.220 
much amperage even single radiator fan

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.680 
much amperage even single radiator fan
will<00:07:28.370> be<00:07:28.490> a<00:07:28.520> bit<00:07:31.030> yeah<00:07:32.030> I<00:07:32.060> think<00:07:32.240> I<00:07:32.300> got<00:07:32.419> a<00:07:32.449> tiny

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
will be a bit yeah I think I got a tiny

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.300 
will be a bit yeah I think I got a tiny
little<00:07:32.900> one<00:07:33.110> off<00:07:33.229> a<00:07:33.319> vs<00:07:33.620> Commodore<00:07:34.129> or

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
little one off a vs Commodore or

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.550 
little one off a vs Commodore or
something<00:07:34.639> that'll<00:07:34.849> do<00:07:34.970> the<00:07:35.090> job<00:07:35.440> thanks<00:07:36.440> for

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
something that'll do the job thanks for

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.860 
something that'll do the job thanks for
watching
