00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.380
 Tell us the beauty, we're there, yes. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 our championship to the elite this is the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.620
 fifth episode of the second season 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.150
 We're doing very well on the third 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 division of the English championship 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
 in the fourth episode I got to ask 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.680
 half a million pounds to the board and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 they did not accept 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480
 In this episode I will ask for 300 and a few 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 thousand pounds but I did not see the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.769
 The answer they gave I also researched 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 Some of the players you mentioned to me 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.279
 and I liked those two guys there that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.590
 highlight in this episode 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.989
 the kim kim go because because he is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 steering wheel can be the side defender 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.280
 The left-sided right-hand side is a 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 joker in defense and is also young can 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.340
 evolve 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
 the same goes for this guy there goes in god 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.390
 the guy is half striker can act in the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 the left tip or the right tip 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.920
 also acrobat and has five scenes of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.559
 bad leg to face is also a little something 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.230
 Pro attack a good option I'll go after 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.329
 to leave at the end of the season or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.370
 even january window 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.409
 the first game of today is against the notts 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 county for the tenth round of the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 I'll tell you guys already 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.189
 Goodbye to you, we have enough 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.810
 goals in this episode and the highlight is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.310
 for the last match of the fourth match 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.619
 this episode was a match 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.509
 difficult I played against the second 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.750
 placed in the championship then it was a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.000
 direct dispute for the first place of the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.650
 championship also has to show the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.689
 You cast report I want. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.729
 show the two attackers reservations in the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.259
 fourth episode and showed the guardian and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.540
 jackson who are my attackers 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.210
 and in this episode I want to show 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.329
 the immense profit that the direct 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.939
 large and hard which is also a 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 willians time reserve reserve the goal 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 So speaking domain of the car just 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 score the third goal in the match against 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.399
 the norusca he made two goals there we won 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 3-0 we played well in these games 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.070
 today we have several goals I played 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.470
 fine damn good 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.340
 hence the board said it does not accept the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 300 thousand 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 but they can give me £ 194,000 and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 I accepted better than nothing right 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 now I rocking there the values ​​I 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 I have 101 thousand in cash 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.640
 Why split up a bit? 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.379
 transfer and a bit for wages 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.720
 You do not have to hire people, but you have to 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.700
 have to pay the salary of them emissora 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.800
 I have a thousand is not much but it's better 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 of what I had before I had only 14 thousand 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760
 5 thousand in cash and it's very very little 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.770
 second from today it is against 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.180
 radio the people also valid by 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.490
 championship in that match the first 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.940
 time was full of chances and kicks the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.130
 goal 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.500
 Tai O hard taking this step to aleph 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.840
 santos fc had this second chance in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.020
 but he kicked the corner of the crossbar 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.220
 at the end of the first half I have this 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.710
 goal scored by the goalkeeper 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.960
 and we go first time in 0 to 0 but in the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.640
 The second time we came back with everything and 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.550
 we count to cause shock 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.440
 fast with 1 to 0 at the beginning of the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.270
 second hardy time it's booking 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.430
 reservation as I just spoke of booking 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.470
 from luke williams because he's older 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.390
 and evolve that much, but it's a good 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.290
 option when someone hurts me 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.570
 lose a player 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.940
 he is there I can put it on the pitch there 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.830
 which marked me 2 to 0 who recently 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.740
 hired the young midfielder central 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.510
 and the hype closed the score 3-0 with that 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.690
 Goal coverage until then okay I need 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.180
 he left in attack for the rest the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.580
 main players is not bug jackson 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.860
 they can join the team that stays 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.470
 Well, we play well and we won the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.140
 Today's second match 3 to 0 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.180
 let's motivate the cast for the match 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.190
 cup to cup where is tom the most 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.900
 but it's a glass that I 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 I also want to do well because of the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.310
 money is going to give me a good a good money 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.200
 If I continue from the championship, you 're there. 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 report including the 21 years of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.580
 Age 62 has been evolving well into 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.500
 My goodness, look at the points. 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.209
 technique he is winning and winning 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.680
 practically all are well penalties 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.530
 because there is no problem so far 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.170
 and hardware is reserve backup it already 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 He's 29 years old, he's 60 so he's 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.840
 But there to stay there to replace someone. 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.720
 If I need to, I'll even miss the point. 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.640
 in evolution and already is already won and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.320
 now you're starting to want to retire 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.360
 very soon and everything 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.239
 Williams will be the next game when 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.890
 great for retiring your neighborhood 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.840
 be sold the bus is the first 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.850
 first choice for attack 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.739
 as the match of the cup against the other 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.260
 it was also a match full of chances 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.000
 there is a gomes bomb on the dash and 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.710
 They also went upstairs, just look at this. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.450
 kick to the burnout that our goalkeeper 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.720
 carson defended galley 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.030
 it was a match full of 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.530
 full of opportunities who opened the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.750
 The big score was 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.670
 31 minutes after the tour of the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.380
 profit - the first great and warm 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.610
 in that dash I was 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.130
 placing the foot in the shape 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.220
 after scoring the goal it will run 1 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.780
 the 0 also had the chance with the volume and 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.150
 midfield becomes that kicks very well 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.310
 from outside demanded a good defense of the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.620
 goalkeeper but gomes did not stop there 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.830
 people watch this pass through coverage that 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.560
 he did and otton just pushed to the bottom of the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.660
 goal 2 to 0 in the meantime had already 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.120
 liquidated the match they went up 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.220
 in the second half what is something like that 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.030
 different happens in the cup than in the 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.740
 championship 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.080
 they do not give up until the very end 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.930
 because it's an opportunity, right? 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.030
 It's just a game if you win it was already and already 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.400
 is classified as disqualified then 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.200
 they went up went behind the goal 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.440
 but they did not get a very good defense 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.540
 and I just né in the active it the standard and 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.460
 we close the match in 2 to 0 we are 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.140
 classified for the next round of 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.970
 Alston canopy is more a pantry us 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.280
 It's rating is very good. 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.750
 and the last match of today's episode is 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.419
 the most important thing we have to 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.520
 show you against charlton 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.860
 elton is nothing less than the team 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.570
 is in second place in the championship 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.270
 disputing with us directly the 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.580
 first place well at the beginning of the game 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.100
 happened to me what rarely happens and 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.900
 happened once in the fourth division that 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.970

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.040
 against holden opening the scoring 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.380
 nine minutes from the first half the same 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.390
 guy who did own goal for me in there 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.700
 in the last episode of the fourth division and 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.680
 then take the goal and went up not 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.070
 I could lose to him, I was playing in 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.440
 home is my obligation to even a goal gives 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.060
 a good result and with the fans 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.490
 we keep on top of the table 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.470

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.300
 the second time was total boom of them 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.460
 I could not attack them not 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.530

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.000
 wait they just closed and me 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.100
