00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.830 
wrapped up let's hope that in that the
grain<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:03.260> undo<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:05.510> very<00:01:06.510> complicated

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
grain out to undo this very complicated

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
grain out to undo this very complicated
business<00:01:07.320> unwrapping<00:01:07.979> stuff<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.820> with

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
business unwrapping stuff there with

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.370 
business unwrapping stuff there with
that<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> back<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> main<00:01:15.780> devices<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that so back in the main devices you can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469
