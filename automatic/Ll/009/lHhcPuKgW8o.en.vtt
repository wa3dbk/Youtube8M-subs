how's it going guys this is Sam from
free<00:00:16.680> run<00:00:16.830> code<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.220> UK<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.450> for

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
free run code at UK we're here for

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
free run code at UK we're here for
another<00:00:18.840> quick<00:00:19.170> tutorial<00:00:19.320> basically<00:00:20.100> we're

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
another quick tutorial basically we're

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.070 
another quick tutorial basically we're
going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.520> looking<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.539> cat<00:00:21.810> Belle

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
going to be looking at the the cat Belle

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.519 
going to be looking at the the cat Belle
or<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.860> people<00:00:23.130> call<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> devil<00:00:23.759> drop

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
or some people call it the devil drop

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.240 
or some people call it the devil drop
basically<00:00:25.529> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> break<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> down

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
basically we're going to break it down

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.830 
basically we're going to break it down
into<00:00:26.490> three<00:00:26.610> points<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.360> going<00:00:27.509> to<00:00:27.570> look<00:00:27.689> at

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
into three points we're going to look at

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
into three points we're going to look at
your<00:00:28.020> your<00:00:28.529> preparation<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.340> take<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:29.790> then

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
your your preparation and take off then

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
your your preparation and take off then
we're<00:00:30.540> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> look<00:00:30.900> at<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> rotation<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
we're going to look at the rotation and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.100 
we're going to look at the rotation and
then<00:00:32.129> we're<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> look<00:00:32.580> at<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.110> landing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
then we're going to look at the landing

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.650 
then we're going to look at the landing
basically<00:00:34.590> opening<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> landing<00:00:35.660> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
basically opening up for the landing so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
basically opening up for the landing so
let's<00:00:37.110> break<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.470> now<00:00:37.830> okay<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
let's break that down now okay so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
let's break that down now okay so
basically<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.870> looking<00:00:39.900> at<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.530> initial

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
basically we're looking at the initial

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
basically we're looking at the initial
preparation<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.239> you're<00:00:42.330> gonna<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
preparation for it you're gonna need to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
preparation for it you're gonna need to
be<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> good<00:00:43.309> cat<00:00:44.309> position<00:00:44.670> basically<00:00:45.360> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
be in a good cat position basically it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
be in a good cat position basically it's
nicely<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:45.930> you've<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.199> an<00:00:46.290> over<00:00:46.589> grip<00:00:46.620> for

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
place and as I'm prep they're preparing

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.779 
place and as I'm prep they're preparing
for<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.509> actual<00:01:15.869> movement<00:01:16.560> take<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:17.250> now

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
keep my arms quite straight because that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.469 
keep my arms quite straight because that
keeps<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.830> away<00:01:20.069> from<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.550> my<00:01:20.910> object<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.390> I'm

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
keeps me away from my my object that I'm

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
keeps me away from my my object that I'm
taking<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:21.959> from<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> second

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
taking off from and then the second

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
taking off from and then the second
point<00:01:23.849> is<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.179> be<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> rotation<00:01:25.099> so<00:01:26.099> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
point is going to be the rotation so the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.309 
point is going to be the rotation so the
key<00:01:26.429> thing<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.849> take<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.110> take

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
key thing on your take off as you take

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.740 
key thing on your take off as you take
off<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.649> want<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.830> bring<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.399> hips<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
off you want to bring your hips out and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
off you want to bring your hips out and
backwards<00:01:31.259> slightly<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:32.039> you<00:01:32.459> don't

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
backwards slightly because you don't

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
backwards slightly because you don't
want<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.849> rotate<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> wall<00:01:33.959> obviously

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
want to rotate into the wall obviously

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
want to rotate into the wall obviously
so<00:01:35.039> you<00:01:35.069> keep<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.399> arms<00:01:35.520> quite<00:01:35.849> straight<00:01:36.149> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so you keep your arms quite straight to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.540 
so you keep your arms quite straight to
keep<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.569> distance<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.380> push<00:01:37.679> from

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
keep that distance and as you push from

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.339 
keep that distance and as you push from
the<00:01:38.700> bend<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.179> knees<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.990> bring<00:01:40.229> your

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:40.349 
the bend of your knees you bring your

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.350 
the bend of your knees you bring your
hips<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.800> everything<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.640> butt<00:01:41.910> out

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
hips and everything and your butt out

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.029 
hips and everything and your butt out
and<00:01:42.420> backwards<00:01:42.959> slightly<00:01:43.440> which<00:01:43.739> is<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
and backwards slightly which is going to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.309 
and backwards slightly which is going to
bring<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.369> away<00:01:44.489> from<00:01:44.849> the<00:01:44.970> wall<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:46.140> then

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
bring you away from the wall and then
