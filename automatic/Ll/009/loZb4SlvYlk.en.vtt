I<00:01:21.880> think<00:01:22.870> it's<00:01:23.340> 500<00:01:24.340> sheets<00:01:29.880> key<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
I think it's 500 sheets key to the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
I think it's 500 sheets key to the
tokens<00:01:31.690> that<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:32.620> where<00:01:32.740> all<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.950> tacos

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
tokens that you know where all the tacos

00:01:33.340 --> 00:02:03.210 
tokens that you know where all the tacos
do<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:41.200> all<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.530> cardboard<00:01:41.890> cut-out<00:01:48.119> trays

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the math there

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
the math there
you<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.760> little<00:02:20.030> track<00:02:21.220> piece<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:26.750> was
