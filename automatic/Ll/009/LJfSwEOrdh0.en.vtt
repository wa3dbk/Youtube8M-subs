above a line of cars and over the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.640 
above a line of cars and over the
rooftops<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> trail<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.660> pink<00:04:34.080> flowers<00:04:34.530> in

again<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:41.240> thought<00:04:42.240> about<00:04:42.480> dad<00:04:42.810> at<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.110> seaside

with<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.800> big<00:04:44.100> smile<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.460> his<00:04:44.700> face<00:04:44.780> then<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
with a big smile on his face then I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.170 
with a big smile on his face then I
thought<00:04:46.139> about<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.440> whole<00:04:46.680> man<00:04:46.800> Hague<00:04:47.130> then<00:04:47.970> I

thought about a whole man Hague then I

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.719

thought<00:04:48.389> about<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.840> story<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.440> gold<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.639> I

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.070 
thought about the story of gold and I
realized<00:04:51.240> what<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.479> should<00:04:51.720> have<00:04:51.750> done<00:04:51.870> that
