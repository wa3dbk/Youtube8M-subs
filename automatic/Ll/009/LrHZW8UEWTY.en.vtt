position<00:01:17.290> that<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:18.159> would<00:01:18.340> be<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.760> was<00:01:18.909> just

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
position that it would be if I was just

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.620 
position that it would be if I was just
normally<00:01:19.659> tacking<00:01:20.050> up<00:01:20.170> wind<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:21.820> just<00:01:22.330> riding

know taking the time to get my speed
right<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.600> my<00:01:31.930> kite<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.800> right<00:01:33.040> position

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760

right and my kite in the right position
to<00:01:34.360> make<00:01:34.570> my<00:01:34.810> turn<00:01:35.760> it's<00:01:36.760> really<00:01:37.030> important

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
last minute I never ever unhook until I

last minute I never ever unhook until I
have<00:01:43.750> full<00:01:44.080> control<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:45.730> worst<00:01:45.970> thing<00:01:46.180> you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
have full control the worst thing you

have full control the worst thing you
can<00:01:46.420> do<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.690> unhook<00:01:47.080> too<00:01:47.530> early<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.340> then<00:01:48.400> you

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
can do is unhook too early and then you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.750 
can do is unhook too early and then you
know<00:01:49.390> wreck<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.170> whole<00:01:50.320> wave<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.400> I've<00:01:51.580> come

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
know wreck the whole wave so I've come

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.460 
know wreck the whole wave so I've come
right<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.300> bottom<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.720> this<00:01:52.780> way<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.290> can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
right to the bottom of this way you can

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.570 
right to the bottom of this way you can
see<00:01:53.650> my<00:01:53.800> kite<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.340> at<00:01:54.880> about<00:01:55.180> 45<00:01:55.690> degrees<00:01:56.580> all

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
see my kite is at about 45 degrees all

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.730 
see my kite is at about 45 degrees all
I'm<00:01:57.970> going<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.210> do<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.540> my<00:01:58.720> cart<00:01:59.020> at<00:01:59.500> this

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
I'm going to do with my cart at this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.490 
I'm going to do with my cart at this
point<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.940> is<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.900> know<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.350> why

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
point and this is you know this is why

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.490 
point and this is you know this is why
side<00:02:03.010> Shore<00:02:03.570> conditions<00:02:04.570> are<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.870> easy<00:02:05.290> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
side Shore conditions are so easy to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.020 
side Shore conditions are so easy to
ride<00:02:05.740> compared<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.250> everything<00:02:06.430> else<00:02:06.670> is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
ride compared to everything else is

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.059 
ride compared to everything else is
because<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.810> don't<00:02:08.019> really<00:02:08.349> need<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.890> turn

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
because you don't really need to turn

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.729 
because you don't really need to turn
your<00:02:09.280> card<00:02:09.519> at<00:02:09.670> all<00:02:09.819> all<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:11.050> need<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
your card at all all you need to do is

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.440 
your card at all all you need to do is
just<00:02:11.769> get<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.400> perfect<00:02:12.640> position<00:02:12.910> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
just get it in the perfect position and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.660 
just get it in the perfect position and
then<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.900> saddle<00:02:14.379> adjustments<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.400> what<00:02:15.640> I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
then do saddle adjustments and what I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.559 
then do saddle adjustments and what I
mean<00:02:15.760> by<00:02:15.970> subtle<00:02:16.480> adjustments<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:17.370> moving<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
mean by subtle adjustments is moving it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.440 
mean by subtle adjustments is moving it
slightly<00:02:19.569> up<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.110> slightly<00:02:20.379> down<00:02:20.739> as<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.640> run

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
slightly up and slightly down as you run

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.559 
slightly up and slightly down as you run
along<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> wave<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.830> turns<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.420> can

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
along the wave and do turns so you can

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.440 
along the wave and do turns so you can
see<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:27.040> before<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.549> unhook<00:02:28.180> I'm

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
see here just before I unhook I'm

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.319 
see here just before I unhook I'm
bringing<00:02:29.409> my<00:02:29.439> card<00:02:29.829> up<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.549> little<00:02:30.999> bit

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
bringing my card up just a little bit

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.480 
bringing my card up just a little bit
higher<00:02:31.749> than<00:02:31.780> what

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
higher than what

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.870 
higher than what
was<00:02:32.700> when<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.000> initially<00:02:33.330> came<00:02:33.570> into<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> wave

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
was when I initially came into the wave

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.090 
was when I initially came into the wave
then<00:02:35.880> when<00:02:36.660> I'm<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.320> about<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> start<00:02:38.010> my

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
then when I'm just about to start my

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.680 
then when I'm just about to start my
bottom<00:02:38.550> turn<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:39.030> where<00:02:39.300> i'm<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
bottom turn that's where i'm going to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.650 
bottom turn that's where i'm going to
unhook<00:02:40.020> one<00:02:40.440> iron<00:02:40.740> hook<00:02:41.070> i'm<00:02:41.370> gonna<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.940> going

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
unhook one iron hook i'm gonna be going

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.400 
unhook one iron hook i'm gonna be going
from<00:02:43.220> shading<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.400> kite<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:46.140> full

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
from shading the kite out to to full

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.740 
from shading the kite out to to full
power<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.400> i'm<00:02:47.490> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.760> get<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.090> little<00:02:48.390> burst

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
power so i'm going to get a little burst

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.100 
power so i'm going to get a little burst
of<00:02:48.930> energy<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> kite<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:51.000> i've<00:02:51.450> pulled

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
of energy from the kite so i've pulled

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.130 
of energy from the kite so i've pulled
my<00:02:52.820> chicken<00:02:53.820> loop<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.360> my<00:02:54.450> harness<00:02:54.750> I've

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
my chicken loop out of my harness I've

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520 
my chicken loop out of my harness I've
unhooked<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.250> now<00:02:56.700> i'm<00:02:57.090> lowering<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:58.140> center

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
unhooked and now i'm lowering my center

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.150 
unhooked and now i'm lowering my center
of<00:02:58.560> gravity<00:02:58.790> to<00:03:00.260> basically<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:01.860> much

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
of gravity to basically get as much

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.700 
of gravity to basically get as much
drive<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.880> possible<00:03:03.600> out<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.930> my<00:03:04.200> bottom<00:03:04.500> turn

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
drive as possible out of my bottom turn

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.460 
drive as possible out of my bottom turn
you<00:03:05.520> really<00:03:05.850> want<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> lean<00:03:06.360> over<00:03:06.390> your<00:03:07.230> heel

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you really want to lean over your heel

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
know hold that stance of like you're

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.300 
know hold that stance of like you're
sitting<00:03:12.210> down<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.820> throughout<00:03:15.210> the

pinnacle of the bottom turn you but

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.440 
pinnacle of the bottom turn you but
almost<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.980> touch<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.370> water<00:03:20.550> what

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
almost going to touch the water what

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.630 
almost going to touch the water what
this<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.810> doing<00:03:22.020> is<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.620> giving<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.070> forward

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
this is doing is it's giving you forward

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.880 
this is doing is it's giving you forward
momentum<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.390> drive<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.110> that's<00:03:25.530> what<00:03:25.800> you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
momentum and drive and that's what you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.950 
momentum and drive and that's what you
really<00:03:26.040> need<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.550> go<00:03:26.670> back<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.330> face<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
really need to go back up the face and

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.770 
really need to go back up the face and
hook<00:03:28.350> into<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.710> pocket<00:03:29.090> at<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.330> point<00:03:30.660> my

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
hook into the pocket at this point my

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.870 
hook into the pocket at this point my
kites<00:03:31.230> not<00:03:31.500> doing<00:03:31.830> anything<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.460> moving

kites not doing anything that moving
down<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.210> line<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:33.930> want<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.170> try<00:03:34.350> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
down the line so you want to try and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.400 
down the line so you want to try and
hold<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.980> heel<00:03:35.250> side<00:03:35.550> rail<00:03:35.850> for<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.870> long<00:03:37.350> as

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
hold that heel side rail for as long as

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.160 
hold that heel side rail for as long as
possible<00:03:38.180> basically<00:03:39.180> until<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.780> get<00:03:39.960> about

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
possible basically until you get about

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.170 
possible basically until you get about
three<00:03:40.500> quarters<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.130> way<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.940> face<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the wave that's when you're going to you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.720 
the wave that's when you're going to you
know<00:03:45.510> thrust<00:03:45.930> all<00:03:46.230> your<00:03:46.500> weight<00:03:46.680> from<00:03:47.280> leaning

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
know thrust all your weight from leaning

over your heel side to now leaning over
your<00:03:50.820> toe<00:03:50.970> side<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.630> often<00:03:52.500> put<00:03:52.830> my<00:03:53.010> arm<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
your toe side I often put my arm in the

you know to really lean over and for
some<00:03:57.780> reason<00:03:57.810> makes<00:03:58.410> me<00:03:58.620> feel<00:03:58.860> like<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.580> know

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
some reason makes me feel like you know

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
would do is if it was getting too low or

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.330 
would do is if it was getting too low or
too<00:04:17.910> high<00:04:18.090> would<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.170> subtly<00:04:20.010> adjust

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
too high would just be subtly adjust
