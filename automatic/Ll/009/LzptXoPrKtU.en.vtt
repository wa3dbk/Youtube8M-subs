00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.440
 Welcome friends to another 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.370
 minecraft motto and today it is about the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.269
 puck 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 yes yes this is about a lot 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.550
 yeah yeah it adds quite a lot of effect 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.770
 Add new items and one starts each one best 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.900
 on 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.029
 with his klo here the most important in the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.570
 scratch I show you just briefly 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.469
 Best one is so here then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.870
 once in the toilet but not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.090
 we have one more then stand 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.559
 do you need klopapier the opened 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.039
 lacks plain paper just like that 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.690
 then you have three-ply klopapier 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.039
 we are already a bit and now 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 then you just sit down 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 comfortable on the pott and presses one 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.040
 rush and 40 the program after three times 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 So the toilets are the water at the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.360
 toilet all because you have the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.580
 Fill the bucket you can 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.939
 go again shitting beautiful 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.619
 so we have six pieces with and with it 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.970
 You can really do a lot of cool things 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.500
 you would not start that way now 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.689
 thought 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 For example , you can do it now 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:32.329
 make a blog shit here 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.329
 so I'll do one more 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.840
 you really shit with this blog 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.920
 do 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 one can only times burn in the oven 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:50.390
 lasts now for a short time but now 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:55.230
 looks like we get a fuck in god 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.570
 that's really crazy 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.530
 we have a fucking in god and with it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.040
 we can and do forces and disreputable 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:13.790
 thing after then I look for a kiss 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:19.920
 sticks intoxication fixated in god one can 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:25.940
 do all the tools with a pickaxe or 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.940
 others like armor 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 yes, the strength of the armor or the tools 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.890
 is between iron and stone 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.040
 So really pretty 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.519
 I find beneficial and what still 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.939
 a very cool advantage is that is 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.010
 You can also do it on it house 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:57.409
 and who would have thought if you were now 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:02.090
 up to now uses around his so 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.650
 a fucking high why so to his field 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.650
 then to order grows all 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.669
 I do not think so much faster 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.189
 I'm like that would have to be like that 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.189
 I was not right now but stood where 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.060
 So it's pretty cool anyway 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.569
 then we can just look like 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.709
 Good things are but one 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.419
 shovel chaos but also sees it is 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.109
 I'm so smart I'm still one now 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.109
 game mode 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.410
 you can see that's good too 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.440
 really not weak later it can 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:04:02.800
 better so it really is between 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:09.670
 iron and stone so the murder is 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:12.970
 even for the 1.4.2009 crasser mod 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.160
 and then there is something else right 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.989
 Cool is how I think and pretty 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.000
 advantageous because then you can namely 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.990
 still take the graz and how 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 a yes travel to the example you can to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:35.890
 a blogger 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.330
 this was the best shit i did 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.160
 You can really do a lot with it 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.360
 make heads and what a great chance 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.480
 you bring that right now yes 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.120
 something very small for you and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.420
 Although that demonstrate because this great 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.520
 shit is immune from tnt and cribs 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
 I can prove that too 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.180
 constructed spectator line i am 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.180
 redstone profi overlooks 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.740
 and do not break although already a 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.419
 so big explosion was really already 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.610
 very cool 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:18.949
 the mod the war brings it 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.270
 Of course a lot, I hope the model 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.400
 you liked it 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.069
 I hope I have not forgotten me 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.659
 I'm sure even 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.620
 I'm going to do such a point system now 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:33.770
 I wanted to insert and indeed 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.699
 It's all about tea biscuits maximum and then 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.039
 stop the score 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.229
 this power gets from me seven of 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.680
 ten children is really funny 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.389
 No bugs but what I still have 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.159
 Not 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.780
 It's a shame that you go to the toilet 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.639
 can not put on it that would be synonymous 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.469
 very cool when such an animation 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.969
 would 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.750
 I hope that minecraft has what video 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.759
 you like it 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.889

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.310
 Comment what you did not like 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.810
 I would be happy about an abo 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.969
 Do not miss Michael Hughes 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.650

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:13.029
