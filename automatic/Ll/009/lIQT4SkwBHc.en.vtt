00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 in the Mediterranean world there is another tree 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.019
 very unique that extends throughout 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.349
 this basin that is the cork oak 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.359
 the scientific name schubert bodies and 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.829
 that in Asturias we call her the suffers anger 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.360
 for his freire the cork oak is a 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:22.000
 belongs as to his group is a fallacy 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.879
 of gender bodies and perhaps the most 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.070
 singular of it is its bark the 

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.840
 thick bark of the cork oak that the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.300
 man has used it since time 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.920
 immemorial has served not only 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.309
 pass cork if the corks 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.910
 but more recently for the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.730
 curtains of places of protection and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.070
 especially to form those places 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.829
 where bees logically look for the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.039
 chamber 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.500
 in the manufacture of honey is this 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.870
 hard cork bark allows a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 perfect isolation and that's why man 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.549
 has also used in any 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.559
 system to avoid losing the 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.229
 heat and everyone knows the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.990
 advantages of cork from the point of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.360
 body morphological view its see 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.439
 Characterizes because the leaves look like 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.020
 quite the oaks are rigid leaves 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.170
 thorny with lower face pressel 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.049
 full of hairs those hairs that isolate 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 environment but maybe the character 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 more distinctive to differentiate 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.220
 oak leaves Leaves 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 oak is to see the superior nerve in the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 oak the upper nerve I mean the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 The superior nerve of the leaf is more or 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.190
 less straight while if a bit cga 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.520
 in the case of the offerings of the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.829
 cork oaks 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.789
 the acorns are pretty similar 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.640
 among all gender groups 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.340
 bodies and especially the habitat that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.869
 occupies the north Spain know is very 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.640
 singular we have already said that it is a 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.890
 Mediterranean plant well in 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.610
 asturias the cork oak only lives 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.439
 that territory that has a microclimate 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.719
 clearly Mediterranean that is over 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.119
 less than the naval valley the 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.250
 cork oak forms formations not very 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.660
 dense sometimes associated with the carballo 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 and that constitute our carballeda in 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.769
 this case in our his real fry and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.750
 which is that some of them are 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.140
 declared landscape protected as 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140
 of the forest
