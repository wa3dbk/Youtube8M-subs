00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 yes no time not lost too 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.450
 What are you doing here? 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.920
 or not as it seems I have 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.170
 two cities on my way here 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 cross both band left 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.600
 I did not think that out 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 It's true that we have you 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.199
 first asked something like it can be 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.110
 that you are outside what do you have with you 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.030
 made our original if it is you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.410
 I do not like why I tried 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 not easy to catch 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.400
 especially now where you are in numbers 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.400
 superior since you have our original 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.650
 but not killed with so many 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.030
 of you, whether this is me this time 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.030
 becomes more fun 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.190
 she is jan o 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:29.060
 it is a war killing the enemy without 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.189
 grace , the ecb council actually seems 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 Kirby and Naruto so likes to get around 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.420
 every price 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 I'm not ready 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.700
 are becoming more and more of his friends 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.960
 to lock 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.409
 With 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 Did you forget that true strength 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.770
 means 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.090
 I'll go where you are 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.090
 to kill you 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.540
 you are not shinobi oszkÃ³ noah you 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 do not be part of the promise 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.160
 these are good i get used to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.160
 faster brother 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.780
 that would have brought these eyes the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.690
 once my brother belonged to you 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.290
 terribly sad the burden on more 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.280
 but that's just right you just too 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.280
 brothers
