00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that was exciting yeah I think a lot of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.599 
that was exciting yeah I think a lot of
people<00:00:22.560> well<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> New<00:00:22.980> York<00:00:23.220> they've<00:00:23.400> never

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
people well in New York they've never

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.759 
people well in New York they've never
forgotten<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> team<00:00:24.869> doesn't

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
forgotten it because the team doesn't

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
forgotten it because the team doesn't
have<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> same<00:00:26.400> personnel<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.390> then

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
have the same personnel that it had then

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
have the same personnel that it had then
and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.260> think<00:00:29.220> basketball<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and I think basketball is one of the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
and I think basketball is one of the
difference<00:00:30.570> today<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.769> teamwork

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
difference today is that the teamwork

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
difference today is that the teamwork
isn't<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> used<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.510> guys<00:00:33.719> used

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
isn't what it used to be you guys used

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
isn't what it used to be you guys used
to<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.079> eight<00:00:34.350> ten<00:00:34.590> twelve<00:00:34.890> passes<00:00:35.280> before<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
to make eight ten twelve passes before a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.639 
to make eight ten twelve passes before a
shot<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> Celtics<00:00:37.380> today

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
shot right I think the Celtics today

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
shot right I think the Celtics today

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
never think that having been an athlete

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.590 
never think that having been an athlete
I<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:36.190> whatever<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.640> get<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.880> deserve<00:02:37.420> it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
I think whatever you get you deserve it

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.240 
I think whatever you get you deserve it
no<00:02:37.750> no<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> didn't<00:02:38.260> say<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.650> think<00:02:38.950> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
no no I didn't say that I think you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.949 
no no I didn't say that I think you
should<00:02:39.280> take<00:02:39.640> all<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:40.000> can<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.840> do

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
should take all you can get but I do

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.630 
should take all you can get but I do
think<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.410> it's<00:02:41.650> beginning<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.340> out<00:02:42.520> of

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
think that it's beginning to get out of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.890 
think that it's beginning to get out of
control<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.060> think<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.360> hurting<00:02:43.570> some<00:02:43.870> of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
control and I think it's hurting some of

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.420 
control and I think it's hurting some of
the<00:02:44.050> club's<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.560> gone<00:02:44.709> crazy<00:02:45.040> for

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
the club's that have gone crazy for

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.400 
the club's that have gone crazy for
example<00:02:45.820> Cleveland<00:02:46.209> paying<00:02:46.990> too<00:02:47.200> much<00:02:47.230> for

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
example Cleveland paying too much for

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.400 
example Cleveland paying too much for
too<00:02:47.680> many<00:02:48.209> well<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.510> situation<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.200> think

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
too many well in that situation I think

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.020 
too many well in that situation I think
that<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.740> owners<00:02:51.040> fault<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:51.580> Yeah

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
that was the owners fault right Yeah

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.240 
that was the owners fault right Yeah
right<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.170> think<00:02:53.470> most<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.830> guys<00:02:53.950> are

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
right but I think most of the guys are

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.610 
right but I think most of the guys are
getting<00:02:54.519> what<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.670> should<00:02:55.000> get<00:02:55.380> that's<00:02:56.380> good

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
getting what they should get that's good

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.810 
getting what they should get that's good
that<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.769> feel<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.220> way<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:57.519> you're

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
that you feel that way because you're

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.449 
that you feel that way because you're
getting<00:02:57.940> your<00:02:58.090> 10%<00:02:58.660> off<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.160> not<00:03:00.160> because<00:03:00.430> of

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
getting your 10% off it not because of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.880 
getting your 10% off it not because of
my<00:03:00.640> 10%<00:03:01.239> because<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:02.200> know<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> average<00:03:02.530> fan
