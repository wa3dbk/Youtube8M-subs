00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
seen in the tutorial no no but I

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.440 
seen in the tutorial no no but I
definitely<00:05:28.420> recommend<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.230> was<00:05:29.470> only

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
definitely recommend this it was only

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.580 
definitely recommend this it was only
three<00:05:31.450> always<00:05:31.660> affording<00:05:32.110> been<00:05:32.200> sensible

lemme<00:05:32.950> check<00:05:32.980> the<00:05:33.700> mask<00:05:34.000> was<00:05:36.330> $3.99<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.630> was

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
lemme check the mask was $3.99 so it was

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.530 
lemme check the mask was $3.99 so it was
four<00:05:37.930> dollars<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.850> that's<00:05:39.850> not<00:05:40.060> too<00:05:40.300> bad

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
four dollars and that's not too bad

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.230 
four dollars and that's not too bad
because<00:05:40.840> I<00:05:41.320> was<00:05:41.740> going<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.280> order<00:05:42.640> a<00:05:42.670> pill<00:05:43.060> off
