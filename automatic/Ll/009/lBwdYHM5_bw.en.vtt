hi this is Josh lair photo educator here
a<00:00:09.000> unique<00:00:09.300> photo<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:10.469> all<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.800> using

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
a unique photo for all of you using

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.549 
a unique photo for all of you using
small<00:00:11.550> speed<00:00:11.880> lights<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.469> think<00:00:13.469> you

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
small speed lights I think you

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.620 
small speed lights I think you
understand<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.130> I'm<00:00:14.219> about<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> say<00:00:14.730> if

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
understand what I'm about to say if

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.240 
understand what I'm about to say if
you're<00:00:15.780> using<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.350> low-power<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you're using it on a low-power or as a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
you're using it on a low-power or as a
fill<00:00:17.520> light<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.180> recycle<00:00:18.660> time<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> recharge

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
fill light the recycle time the recharge

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.290 
fill light the recycle time the recharge
time<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.250> good<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:20.880> shoot<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
time it's pretty good you can shoot a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300 
time it's pretty good you can shoot a
pretty<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:21.660> clip<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.740> soon<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> start

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
pretty good clip as soon as you start

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.429 
pretty good clip as soon as you start
ratcheting<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.060> power<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.720> bouncing<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
ratcheting up that power or bouncing the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.140 
ratcheting up that power or bouncing the
flash<00:00:25.590> off<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> ceiling<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.029> get

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
flash off the ceiling and we really get

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
flash off the ceiling and we really get
a<00:00:27.180> lot<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.449> juice<00:00:27.599> out<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.810> your<00:00:27.869> flash<00:00:28.170> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
a lot of juice out of your flash you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.529 
a lot of juice out of your flash you
find<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.220> recycle<00:00:29.609> time<00:00:29.760> becomes<00:00:30.029> slower

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
find that recycle time becomes slower

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.350 
find that recycle time becomes slower
and<00:00:30.689> slower<00:00:31.500> especially<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:32.969> batteries

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and slower especially as your batteries

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.940 
and slower especially as your batteries
start<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> wear<00:00:33.809> down<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.469> seems<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.829> an

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
start to wear down it seems like an

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.060 
start to wear down it seems like an
eternity<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.910> between<00:00:36.420> shots<00:00:36.739> I've<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
eternity in between shots I've got the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.470 
eternity in between shots I've got the
solution<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.809> quantum<00:00:40.320> turbo<00:00:40.890> SC<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
solution for you the quantum turbo SC is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
solution for you the quantum turbo SC is

power cable for your Flash simply plug
the<00:01:11.010> power<00:01:11.159> cable<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> quantum<00:01:12.090> turbo

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
the power cable into the quantum turbo

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.980 
the power cable into the quantum turbo
plug<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.270> end<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> cable<00:01:15.750> into

plug the other end of the cable into

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.410 
plug the other end of the cable into
your<00:01:16.080> flash<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> go

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
your flash and you're good to go

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
your flash and you're good to go
the<00:01:19.020> reason<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.590> use<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.520> only

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the reason I use this is not only

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
the reason I use this is not only
because<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> gives<00:01:21.450> me<00:01:21.509> faster<00:01:21.960> recycle<00:01:22.439> time

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
because it gives me faster recycle time

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.609 
because it gives me faster recycle time
but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.810> 400<00:01:24.810> full<00:01:25.350> power

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but I can get up to 400 full power

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
but I can get up to 400 full power
flashes<00:01:26.189> from<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.490> device<00:01:27.180> without<00:01:27.810> seeing

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
flashes from this device without seeing

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
flashes from this device without seeing
any<00:01:28.439> drop<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.979> my<00:01:29.070> recycle<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.670> let's<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
any drop in my recycle time let's do a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
any drop in my recycle time let's do a
test<00:01:31.250> this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> nikon<00:01:33.030> sb900

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
test this is the nikon sb900

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.280 
test this is the nikon sb900
with<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> fully<00:01:36.540> charged

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
with a fully charged

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
with a fully charged
quantum<00:01:37.799> turbo<00:01:38.040> SE<00:01:38.340> battery<00:01:38.670> pack<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.659> fire

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
quantum turbo SE battery pack if I fire

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.230 
quantum turbo SE battery pack if I fire
it

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.210 
it
yeah<00:01:42.240> wait<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> recycle<00:01:45.799> fire<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> again

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
yeah wait to a recycle fire it again

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
yeah wait to a recycle fire it again
that<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.390> three<00:01:49.200> seconds<00:01:49.590> let's<00:01:50.159> take

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that was about three seconds let's take

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.770 
that was about three seconds let's take
the<00:01:50.490> battery<00:01:50.759> pack<00:01:50.970> off<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the battery pack off and see how the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.240 
the battery pack off and see how the
flash<00:01:52.020> does<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:53.040> guess<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.700> well

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
flash does I'm gonna guess not so well

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.170 
flash does I'm gonna guess not so well
alright<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> might<00:01:56.549> take<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> long<00:01:56.969> time

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
alright this might take a long time

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.620 
alright this might take a long time
let's<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.860> fire<00:01:58.860> check<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.549> watch<00:01:59.759> have<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> SAN

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
let's see fire check my watch have a SAN

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.649 
let's see fire check my watch have a SAN
