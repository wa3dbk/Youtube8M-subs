three<00:03:09.560> little<00:03:09.770> samples<00:03:11.020> little<00:03:12.020> flower

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
three little samples little flower

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.330 
three little samples little flower
samples<00:03:13.070> out<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.620> last<00:03:15.830> batch<00:03:16.100> i

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
samples out of that and the last batch i

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.900 
samples out of that and the last batch i
did<00:03:16.610> was<00:03:17.440> another<00:03:18.440> batch<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.519> key<00:03:19.700> lime

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
did was another batch of the key lime

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.150 
did was another batch of the key lime
pie<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:21.470> time<00:03:21.800> they're<00:03:22.220> actually

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
pie and this time they're actually

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.830 
pie and this time they're actually
bigger<00:03:25.160> than<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.880> first<00:03:26.120> time<00:03:26.420> i<00:03:28.660> count<00:03:29.660> it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
bigger than the first time i count it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.060 
bigger than the first time i count it
for<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> larger<00:03:30.590> mold<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.180> i<00:03:32.239> use<00:03:32.450> enough

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
for the larger mold and so i use enough

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.759 
for the larger mold and so i use enough
batter<00:03:34.070> to<00:03:34.519> get<00:03:35.170> larger<00:03:36.170> bars<00:03:36.380> i'm<00:03:36.590> also

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
batter to get larger bars i'm also

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.500 
batter to get larger bars i'm also
finding<00:03:37.510> finding<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.470> pour<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:41.239> soap

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
finding finding that if I pour the soap

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.229 
finding finding that if I pour the soap
higher<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.410> mold<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.850> cut<00:03:44.030> them<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
higher in the mold I can cut them a

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.690 
higher in the mold I can cut them a
little<00:03:44.269> bit<00:03:44.660> thinner<00:03:45.070> without<00:03:46.070> losing<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
little bit thinner without losing the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.850 
little bit thinner without losing the
weight<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:46.970> get<00:03:47.570> more<00:03:47.810> bars<00:03:48.170> out<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.590> each<00:03:48.709> one

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
weight and get more bars out of each one

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.210 
weight and get more bars out of each one
usually<00:03:49.100> again<00:03:49.519> about<00:03:50.080> six<00:03:51.080> bars<00:03:51.440> out<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.100> each

just made these cupcakes are very light

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.750 
just made these cupcakes are very light

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
because they are filled with whips out

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.990 
because they are filled with whips out
and<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.390> course<00:04:49.690> top<00:04:49.900> with<00:04:50.140> whipped<00:04:50.290> soap<00:04:50.560> so<00:04:51.000> i

probably<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:55.330> be<00:04:55.540> um<00:04:55.720> samples<00:04:56.380> with<00:04:56.590> some<00:04:56.740> of

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
probably just be um samples with some of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.810 
probably just be um samples with some of
