00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
strong team coordination like we do in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
strong team coordination like we do in
this<00:01:51.810> game<00:01:52.110> play<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> reasons

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
this game play and one of the reasons

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
this game play and one of the reasons

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that you can do that is because on

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.469 
that you can do that is because on

see time and time again i fall back to
the<00:02:12.480> middle<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the middle and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
sufficient protection in this area now

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.640 
sufficient protection in this area now
specifically<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.300> asylum<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.990> do<00:02:19.260> need<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> be

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
specifically on asylum you do need to be

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
specifically on asylum you do need to be
concerned<00:02:20.130> about<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.610> crossfire<00:02:21.300> from

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
now if you watch carefully we're doing

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.860 
now if you watch carefully we're doing
something<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.460> powerful<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
something that is very powerful as a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.860 
something that is very powerful as a
team<00:02:49.470> we're<00:02:50.280> occupying<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.300> center<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
map which gives us a great vantage to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.110 
map which gives us a great vantage to
shoot<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.020> red<00:02:55.560> team<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.130> spawn<00:02:56.910> on

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
shoot at the red team as they spawn on

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.560 
shoot at the red team as they spawn on

their side of the map but additionally

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.620 
their side of the map but additionally
this<00:03:00.570> creates<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.080> unique<00:03:01.290> situation<00:03:01.800> because

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
this creates a unique situation because

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.280 
this creates a unique situation because
if<00:03:03.920> necessary<00:03:04.920> my<00:03:05.460> team<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.210> could<00:03:06.930> fall

if necessary my team and I could fall

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.560 
if necessary my team and I could fall

map if we had to okay if we felt like we

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.750 
map if we had to okay if we felt like we
are<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:11.940> danger<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:13.200> red<00:03:13.440> team<00:03:13.770> if<00:03:14.130> they

their base they have nowhere to fall
back<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.580> shoot<00:03:21.510> down<00:03:21.780> at<00:03:21.990> them<00:03:22.170> from

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
back to as we shoot down at them from

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.140 
back to as we shoot down at them from
the<00:03:22.500> middle<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.070> map<00:03:23.280> okay<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.120> we

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the middle of the map okay so because we

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.540 
the middle of the map okay so because we
occupy<00:03:24.690> two<00:03:24.750> thirds<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> map<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.010> they

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
occupy two thirds of the map and they

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.699 
occupy two thirds of the map and they
only<00:03:26.760> occupy<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.600> third<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.140> map<00:03:28.350> that

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
only occupy one third of the map that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.020 
only occupy one third of the map that
gives<00:03:28.980> us<00:03:29.220> several<00:03:29.630> escape<00:03:30.630> points<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.030> takes

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
gives us several escape points and takes

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.020 
gives us several escape points and takes
away<00:03:33.240> any<00:03:33.720> kind<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.350> escape<00:03:35.160> route<00:03:35.430> from<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
away any kind of escape route from the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.660 
away any kind of escape route from the
red<00:03:36.209> team<00:03:36.240> okay<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.110> see<00:03:37.410> they're<00:03:38.040> really

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
red team okay so you see they're really

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.510 
red team okay so you see they're really
in<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:40.050> bad<00:03:40.290> situation<00:03:40.680> there<00:03:41.250> kind<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.459> caught

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
in a bad situation there kind of caught

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.199 
in a bad situation there kind of caught
between<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:42.090> rock<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.600> hard<00:03:42.630> place<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
between a rock and a hard place this is

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.870 
between a rock and a hard place this is
a<00:03:45.270> very<00:03:45.300> powerful<00:03:45.780> technique<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.709> use<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:47.160> any

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
a very powerful technique to use on any

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.560 
a very powerful technique to use on any
map<00:03:48.270> if<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.810> really<00:03:49.459> pin<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:51.060> opposing

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
map if you can really pin the opposing
