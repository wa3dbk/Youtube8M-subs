00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
pattern here decided to put up cuz i

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.860 
pattern here decided to put up cuz i
only<00:00:07.589> have<00:00:07.709> one<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.100> there<00:00:08.250> but<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.720> is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
only have one on there but this is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.780 
only have one on there but this is
essentially<00:00:10.410> another<00:00:10.650> single<00:00:11.280> stroke<00:00:11.490> for

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
essentially another single stroke for

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.710 
essentially another single stroke for
bass<00:00:12.030> drum<00:00:12.330> pattern<00:00:13.910> but<00:00:14.910> i'll<00:00:15.210> show<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.510> what

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
bass drum pattern but i'll show you what

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.859 
bass drum pattern but i'll show you what
it<00:00:15.810> is<00:00:15.840> and<00:00:16.349> then<00:00:16.470> i<00:00:17.089> will<00:00:18.089> explain<00:00:18.300> how<00:00:18.419> to<00:00:18.599> put

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it is and then i will explain how to put

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320 
it is and then i will explain how to put
it<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.499> really<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:19.859> too<00:00:19.919> bad<00:00:20.369> as<00:00:21.269> long

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it and it's really not too bad as long

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.230 
it and it's really not too bad as long
as<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> single<00:00:21.900> strip<00:00:22.199> force<00:00:22.529> down

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
as you get the single strip force down

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.230 
as you get the single strip force down
it's<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.300> lot<00:00:24.449> trickier<00:00:24.660> than<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.019> seems<00:00:25.349> so<00:00:26.240> but

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it's a lot trickier than it seems so but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:01:06.120 
it's a lot trickier than it seems so but
here<00:00:27.509> is<00:00:27.749> the<00:00:28.109> pattern<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.590> one<00:00:49.800> ride<00:00:50.010> cymbal

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.510 

alright<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:09.200> lot<00:01:09.680> trickier<00:01:09.950> signing

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
alright so it a lot trickier signing

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.150 
alright so it a lot trickier signing
them<00:01:10.640> what<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.880> really<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:12.010> essentially<00:01:13.010> all

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
them what it really is essentially all

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.240 
them what it really is essentially all
I'm<00:01:13.340> doing<00:01:13.580> single<00:01:14.240> stroke<00:01:14.540> pores<00:01:18.040> which<00:01:19.040> are

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
I'm doing single stroke pores which are

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.700 
I'm doing single stroke pores which are
fairly<00:01:19.970> easy<00:01:20.480> to<00:01:20.660> do<00:01:20.900> I<00:01:20.930> mean<00:01:21.290> once<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.560> get<00:01:21.680> a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
fairly easy to do I mean once you get a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.270 
fairly easy to do I mean once you get a
feel<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.200> shove<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:24.230> a<00:01:24.440> trouble<00:01:24.710> plan<00:01:24.980> but

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
feel for it shove it a trouble plan but

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.790 
feel for it shove it a trouble plan but
it's<00:01:25.400> just<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.110> basically<00:01:33.320> what<00:01:33.619> I'm<00:01:33.740> doing

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
it's just and basically what I'm doing

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520 
it's just and basically what I'm doing
I'm<00:01:34.100> playing<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.610> single<00:01:35.390> stroke<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:35.900> hit<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
I'm playing a single stroke for hit the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:47.550 
I'm playing a single stroke for hit the
snare<00:01:36.770> hit<00:01:42.220> I'm<00:01:43.220> just<00:01:43.400> linking<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.060> together

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.800 

but<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.800> try<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.070> keep<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.460> groove<00:01:49.790> going<00:01:50.000> so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
but just try to keep a groove going so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.310 
but just try to keep a groove going so
at<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.020> end<00:01:51.050> of<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.619> do<00:01:51.680> three<00:01:52.160> of<00:01:52.190> them<00:01:53.320> and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
at the end of it I do three of them and

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:06.969 
at the end of it I do three of them and
then<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.680> finish<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.580> some<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.860> it's

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
then I finish it with you some so it's

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.400 
then I finish it with you some so it's
really<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.429> difficult<00:02:08.050> as<00:02:09.050> long<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.319> you

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
really not that difficult as long as you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.490 
really not that difficult as long as you
get<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.759> it's<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.569> lot<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:11.990> virgil

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
get it but it's a lot like that virgil

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.530 
get it but it's a lot like that virgil
donati<00:02:12.530> twiddle<00:02:13.310> thing<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:13.850> I'm<00:02:14.210> sure<00:02:14.420> he

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
donati twiddle thing but I'm sure he

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.960 
donati twiddle thing but I'm sure he
doesn't<00:02:14.810> want<00:02:14.960> crazier<00:02:15.350> stuff<00:02:15.410> than<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.069> but

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
doesn't want crazier stuff than that but

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
doesn't want crazier stuff than that but
someone<00:02:17.270> mentioned<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.870> was<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
someone mentioned it and I was like I to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.970 
someone mentioned it and I was like I to
show<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:20.569> people<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:21.020> groove<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:21.590> too

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
show that to people this groove here too

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.530 
show that to people this groove here too
so<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.110> about<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.940> can<00:02:26.090> vary<00:02:26.330> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so but that's about it you can vary it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:03:03.240 
so but that's about it you can vary it
with<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.930> course

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.940 

anyway<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.640> it
