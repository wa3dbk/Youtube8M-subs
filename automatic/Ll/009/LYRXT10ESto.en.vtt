00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
actually got a serial number here so you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.440 
actually got a serial number here so you
can<00:01:06.390> check<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.710> genuine

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
contacts at the side there's the the cut

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.530 
contacts at the side there's the the cut
half<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> power<00:01:19.740> button<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
half of the power button so that's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
half of the power button so that's
fairly<00:01:21.540> easily<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.290> prepare<00:01:22.799> lee<00:01:22.920> easy<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
fairly easily to prepare lee easy to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
fairly easily to prepare lee easy to
access<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.570> got<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.900> part<00:01:25.200> round

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
access you have got this part round

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
access you have got this part round
there<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> press<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.479> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
there so as you go to press it you
haven't<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.530> free<00:01:28.740> part<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> side

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
haven't got the the free part the side

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
haven't got the the free part the side
bulb<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.939> reinforces<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> case<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
bulb so that reinforces the case at the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800 
bulb so that reinforces the case at the
same<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:32.030> pretty<00:01:33.030> much<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> similar<00:01:33.689> design

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
same time pretty much a similar design

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
same time pretty much a similar design
for<00:01:34.170> these<00:01:34.290> snap<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.710> cases<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> bottom<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
for these snap on cases at the bottom so

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.690 
for these snap on cases at the bottom so
that's<00:01:36.509> fully<00:01:36.780> open<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.310> similar

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that's fully open and then a similar

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
that's fully open and then a similar
thing<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> volume<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.439> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
case itself is is UV crystal coated so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
case itself is is UV crystal coated so
