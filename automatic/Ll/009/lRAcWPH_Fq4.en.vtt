 will go together to discover this 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.779
 car that gives the smile so much 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.000
 besides that a jaguar for renault 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.829
 so in fact the fact that he is not there 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.020
 with us today which allows me 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.750
 to not see contradictors and then for 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.689
 once to say really because this 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.110
 we think with the heart so here it is 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.329
 the friends 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:37.550
 here it is this car is a force 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.200
 mccann and 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.880
 those who like to brand have them 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 no doubt understood them 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.770
 plus it's a turbo is really 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.590
 nice at porsche france entrusted the most 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 the most powerful model then we see 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.640
 here especially his impressive sales 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.110
 who are 21 inches and then she all 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.600
 tool we are going to discover 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.030
 together at these famous LED lights at 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.440
 the back we will discover the whole 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 it's cockpit sail then the turbo ccc 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:18.000
 long train of 7 2 7 mc cann't 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.940
 a cockpit with a flight have almost 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.830
 taken from the 918 a large rev counter 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.140
 a button a function as usual 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 he's right about real life the real 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 life that's it there's one thing that got me that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770
 me that completely seduced me in fact 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 with this car 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 that's why we leave the car park 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.040
 is that despite its size it is 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.440
 drives with simplicity an agility 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.910
 disconcerting and I'm trying to 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.399
 speak to you normally we should have 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:55.890
 afraid then it certainly vibrates everywhere 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 but I drive it with a real real 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 simplicity without fear without fear 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 beyond the help of gay bi or the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.020
 scratch and light my spell finally there is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.190
 something so amazing is that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440
 when they told me that's true 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 we're going to be loaned a mac and 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.459
 great yeah but it's going to be a 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.340
 extraordinary turbo except that back 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.069
 thought people were just talking about one 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.830
 chrono turbo it'll be it's going to be 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.100
 complicated because that's if it's 400 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.100
 horses 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.400
 on his leash and it's going to be 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.230
 no doubt complicated to drive in 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.549
 not at all not so at all 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 besides, she is so 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.830
 silent look know I do not know if 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.230
 it gets along but we drove it but 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.500
 with a relaxation a serenity in 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.450
 city ​​but dark blue there we are we are 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.230
 on red light the stop and start comes from 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.040
 its to work it stops 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.069
 monfils even thought it was a 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 hybrid and I tell myself that there is a real 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 know-how and an engineer's job 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.250
 frankly frankly successful you 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.730
 will have necessarily read the specialized press 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.959
 that she is actually acting dynamic 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.850
 in short it would be one of the cars the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.810
 more fun to drive in its class 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.370
 it's totally from the beginning 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.610
 of the year this is probably one of the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.790
 most exciting cars and 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.620
 the coolest to drive that I could 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.870
 that I was able to try it is from species of 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.940
 of feelings that makes you have the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.730
 feeling that the car so well 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.150
 placed on the ground that can almost nothing we 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.150
 to arrive then 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 it 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.810
 she at 400 horses it's a little more than 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.810
 nine quick the co2 I speak 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.430
 renault could say if he had been there 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.739
 down that not everything is absolutely 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:23.230
 perfect especially this noise there I have not 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:26.920
 so long when we have in fact 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.390
 the awesome is true that both god 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.400
 or the devil is hiding in the details 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.700
 and I'm not audi manna for nothing I have 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.440
 the feeling that only one said and when 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.550
 even to charlieu finished but all that good 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.850
 remains to be discussed it's still 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.850
 very high level 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.880
 other small observation is porsche 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.490
 it's a button a function so on the 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.070
 yahia dashboard normally 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.970
 a lot of everything 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.710
 even while being a fan he is always a 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.270
 Acclimatization time say what will 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.250
 to be interesting is to watch 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.080
 how long does porsche hold with 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.010
 this philosophy which is already a little 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.930
 scratched on the 918 by the way on the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.180
 central console and the hate and the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.240
 beautiful screen well there I think 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.630
 from here was perhaps going to be the los 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.040
 angeles 2015 so within a year 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.570
 take the bets to see land 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.540
 meeting included on the mac at this will 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.760
 maybe just the the the the first one 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.120
 the first small upgrade of 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.880
 digital screens that will land at the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.550
 place counters will also start 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.900
 on this beautiful central console that 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.900
 it will be it will be it will be
