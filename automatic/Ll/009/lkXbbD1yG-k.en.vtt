00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.800
 in front of us are stacks of bars as we see 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:14.880
 stored under a canopy, everything seems to be fine 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.619
 well here we see white spots 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.650
 fungus disease here is a fungus already 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 starts to hit the end parts 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 lumber what leads 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 given defeat we will look at this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 An example of this is what is wrong. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.540
 lumber storage here we see 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 wood 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 almost completely destroyed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 rotted as a result of improper 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 storage and lack of necessary protection 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 wood 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.039
 these sympathetic means that's what 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.700
 leads 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.430
 neglect of remedies 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 wood we can offer in 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 quality 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.570
 good and reliable means here we are 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.750
 present first in performance 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 means that's called neomid 440 e to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.680
 intended for processing 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.869
 lumber in piles of wood 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.930
 wooden houses and log cabins and the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.630
 similar wooden structures given 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.290
 although the septic is pretty strong and if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 they were processed data lumber 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.729
 naturally no mold would not be 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.960
 even stronger a decepticon neomid 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 430 this 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.060
 up to find septic all very good but 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.970
 the only thing is wood 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.329
 turns such a greenish color but 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.329
 but he is very strong and most powerful 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.049
 in front of us is also very popular 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.649
 a drug that protects wood 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.649
 besides rotting from beetles pests 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
 this way if by disease 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.990
 the lumber was processed this 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.299
 stack of timber we would not get here 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 such a disastrous result after 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.950
 lasted here about a year and a half 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.600
 wood 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.470
 Here are such things are obtained if people 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.790
 neglect wood preservatives 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.480
