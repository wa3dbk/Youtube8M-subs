as well first of all really fun thing
you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.500> press<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.670> here

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
you can do is you can press right here

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
you can do is you can press right here
hard<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:23.189> play<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.670> string<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:27.269> relax

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
hard and play that string and then relax

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:40.660 
hard and play that string and then relax
it

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.390 

so<00:00:41.510> that's<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.840> intro<00:00:42.140> there<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.620> then<00:00:43.220> what

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
so that's the intro there and then what

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.230 
so that's the intro there and then what
I'm<00:00:43.490> going<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.670> do<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:43.970> going<00:00:44.180> to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.760 
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
show<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.450> over<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.840> top<00:00:45.080> of<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.320> neck<00:00:45.530> the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
show you over the top of the neck the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.320 
show you over the top of the neck the
frets<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.130> we<00:00:46.340> need<00:00:46.580> they're<00:00:47.030> all<00:00:48.310> now<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:50.120> if

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
frets that we need they're all now so if

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.790 
frets that we need they're all now so if
we<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:50.630> learn<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:50.900> with<00:00:50.990> one<00:00:51.140> finger<00:00:51.380> first

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
we just learn it with one finger first

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.950 
we just learn it with one finger first
then<00:00:52.400> theoretically<00:00:53.210> we<00:00:53.450> just<00:00:53.630> turn<00:00:53.810> them

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
then theoretically we just turn them

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.390 
then theoretically we just turn them
into<00:00:54.050> power<00:00:54.290> chords<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:54.830> you<00:00:55.010> can<00:00:55.160> start

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
into power chords and you can start

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.960 
into power chords and you can start
working<00:00:55.700> on<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.240> we've<00:00:56.390> got<00:00:57.760> 7th<00:00:58.760> fret

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
working on that so we've got 7th fret

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.010 
working on that so we've got 7th fret
and<00:01:00.250> then<00:01:01.250> we're<00:01:01.340> going<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.520> slide<00:01:01.970> it<00:01:02.270> up<00:01:02.450> to

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then we're going to slide it up to

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:13.190 
and then we're going to slide it up to
the<00:01:03.140> 10th<00:01:03.410> friends<00:01:03.890> watch

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.929 

I'm<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.710> hit<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.130> again

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.319 

up<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.659> whole-step<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.350> double<00:01:18.619> dots<00:01:18.799> twice

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
up a whole-step to the double dots twice

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.070 
up a whole-step to the double dots twice
check<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.899> out

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.970 

and<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.770> Sarah

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
and it is Sarah

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:38.399 
and it is Sarah
you

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.139 

it's<00:01:39.340> too<00:01:39.490> hard<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.790> slide<00:01:40.030> just<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.000> then

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
it's too hard to slide just and then

00:01:46.149 --> 00:02:00.359 
it's too hard to slide just and then
we're<00:01:46.240> going<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.390> go<00:01:47.759> 15<00:01:48.759> 14<00:01:55.229> 15<00:01:56.369> 14<00:01:57.369> 15<00:01:58.140> 15<00:01:59.340> 14

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
we're going to go 15 14 15 14 15 15 14

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:09.300 
we're going to go 15 14 15 14 15 15 14
so<00:02:01.000> 3<00:02:01.360> sets<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:03.240> need<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> 14<00:02:08.099> right<00:02:09.099> -

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
so 3 sets of that need on the 14 right -

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.850 
so 3 sets of that need on the 14 right -
10<00:02:09.959> twice

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:27.220 

up<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> 12th<00:02:16.490> twice<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:19.490> 7<00:02:20.490> 10<00:02:21.830> 10<00:02:22.830> 12<00:02:23.550> 12<00:02:25.160> 15

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
up to the 12th twice so 7 10 10 12 12 15

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:38.210 
up to the 12th twice so 7 10 10 12 12 15
1450<00:02:29.510> 1350<00:02:30.710> 14<00:02:32.180> 10<00:02:33.180> 10<00:02:34.760> 12<00:02:35.760> 12<00:02:36.980> turn<00:02:37.980> them<00:02:38.100> into

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
1450 1350 14 10 10 12 12 turn them into

00:02:38.220 --> 00:03:06.309 
1450 1350 14 10 10 12 12 turn them into
power<00:02:38.490> chords<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.270> this
