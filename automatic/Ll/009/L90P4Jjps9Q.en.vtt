00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello to you carp evgeny 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.330
 channel practice ICE means question to 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.630
 subscribers since i became a dead end with 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.719
 repairing my yamaha r6 apologize for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.710
 steam from the mouth has not warmed up the garage so 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.359
 I have 2 garages now 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.599
 adjacent now just stove heated and then 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.019
 batteries will start greece everything will be cool 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.399
 but it's okay not about this question 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.680
 such a plan faced such 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.750
 problem my r6 is mean american 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.440
 market 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 Here on it means tidy in mile in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.270
 x-ray you now work out 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 self-test tidy checks here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.940
 starts to blink oil shows 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.670
 neutral is the waters of the world an hour here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.729
 pharyngitis oil means a and oil not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.470
 burns all right on a regular tidy 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.850
 it shows that the oil level is normal 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.880
 That means the sensor check I found here 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.670
 this line is she here at the dacha wire 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.780
 It means that the full crankcase position 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.900
 there is oil when on the level of this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.060
 the float sensor rises up and 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.240
 closes on the mass here and accordingly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.939
 here we do not burn anything that is, if 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 we will break the chains now 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:46.799
 that's pulled means wire sensor fold 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.710
 the recipe we light up means oil then 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.000
 there is now here is a self test 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.409
 time will pass 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.579
 there will be no oil 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.700
 that is, here it is she fries that the oil is not 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.829
 blinking 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:12.700
 it means that the watering can is oil 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:16.580
 Now we close here again all went out to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.069
 open again blinks mean 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:30.040
 The problem is what I will switch now 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:30.040
 tidy situation is what I leave now 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.760
 that's tidy that's European 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.310
 now we will fix be like that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.440
 here she is now on self test so 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.080
 Immediately I will pay attention to the wire now 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 he hangs us here he is 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.340
 the chain is broken with us now means no in 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.540
 chains 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.540
 mass is not closed to the mass turn on 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.129
 Everything is fine 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.180
 showing what it means in kilometers 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.510
 here they are Celsius 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.709
 instead of fahrenheit and pressure mean us 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.569
 excellent also blinks means petrol in 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.930
 we are also lit neutral here actually 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.860
 then everything is cool everything is cool 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.299
 it means we are now connecting the sensor 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.569
 position again I repeat in position 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.930
 it means we have masses to masses means 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.739
 complete means level that is how 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.060
 it is necessary 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:48.560
 it closes on the mass 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.280
 disconnect the sensor now I'm tucking 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 at least trite 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.400
 yes everything and here please we are lit 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.489
 It means that there is no carter 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:20.610
 oil for unbelievers showing that oil 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.830
 present because it will be in any 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.830
 here we are oil 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.620
 here is such a problem who is with what with 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.880
 faced I think maybe someone 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.180
 have experience on this issue here 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 I ask advice from subscribers and viewers 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.710
 just a channel what could be the problem 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.250
 that is, the high beam is working 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.680
 Please turn the light bulb that is 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.120
 everything works everything is cool shows 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.090
 I tried the speed that's all 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.820
 everything works perfectly but in something 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.340
 the problem don't even understand what it is 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.300
 that is, everything is rechecked and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.500
 the colors of the wires coming in 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.130
 scheme and everything else is perfect 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.350
 but here 's the reason well all right 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.330
 Thanks in advance, I think someone in me 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.310
 this will help all the same contact means 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:33.670
 to me in a personal VKontakte there if 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.360
 write in the group and write on 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.650
 yutuber respectively all right 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 Thank you all for your attention.
