00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Lily I've just been overeating and I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.929 
Lily I've just been overeating and I
think<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.039> combination<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.789> different

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
think it's combination of different

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.319 
think it's combination of different
things<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:49.219> river<00:01:50.219> juice<00:01:50.429> is<00:01:50.579> great<00:01:50.759> because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
things but river juice is great because

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.080 
things but river juice is great because
I<00:01:51.630> drink<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.350> three<00:01:52.710> times<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.069> day<00:01:53.100> 30<00:01:53.640> minutes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I drink it three times a day 30 minutes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.660 
I drink it three times a day 30 minutes
before<00:01:54.569> each<00:01:54.750> meal<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> does<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
before each meal and what that does is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
before each meal and what that does is
it<00:01:56.819> suppresses<00:01:57.359> my<00:01:57.689> appetite<00:01:58.319> so<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.679> means<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it suppresses my appetite so it means I

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
it suppresses my appetite so it means I
don't<00:01:59.039> eat<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.429> much<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.149> won't<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
don't eat as much it won't make you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.240 
don't eat as much it won't make you
suppress<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.289> upset<00:02:01.679> so<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.099> eat

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

foundation with actual serum and I did

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.390 
foundation with actual serum and I did
