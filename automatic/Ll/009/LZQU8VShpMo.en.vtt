00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.250
 I believe that I am the result of everything 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.200
 what my environment has given me of everything 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.480
 what he learned from my ancestors of everything 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.190
 what I learned from my teachers 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.980
 I feel representative of my land 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.220
 representative of my culture of my ethnic group 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.640
 I deal with everything I do in each 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.100
 topic that I sing because I feel like 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 were all of them as if it were 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.640

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.700

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 my room is empty 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.180
 forever 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.000
 in nostalgia I freeze without touching it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.159
 I can not stand this pain 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.840
 you will forget 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 if I forget you 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.740
 they are the two strange others 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 Milan 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.730
 in this song 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.120
 the memory of this love 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.250
 although the code 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.060
 two 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.450
 I am 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.140
 if you want 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.610
 Yes Yes 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.940
 scales 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.430
 that what yes no 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 the music that I make is music 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.160
 romantic if it's true then we 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.460
 we go there to listen to ethnic elements 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.190
 afro but I feel that in my blood in my 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.830
 voice in my feeling is that is that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.069
 essence 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.949
 the first theme is called nothing is a pop 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:35.770
 rock is great has a lot of strength 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.680
 but deep down he has a retro soul that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.629
 song that I like very much is something 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.349
 that hooks me with the past and the other 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.629
 it leaves me well the present a story of 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.550
 love and sadness of someone who left 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.680
 and there is nothing left but I enjoy it 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.370
 much the musicians enjoy it very much 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.939
 he also always miss the house of 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.699
 emeralds the merriment the conversation with 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:03.310
 the neighbors with the family prepare 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.909
 a rich meal and we talked about everything 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.580
 we laugh we dance we make music is 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.590
 wonderful that I think in emeralds 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.930

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.110
 things that we miss the strangest 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.110
