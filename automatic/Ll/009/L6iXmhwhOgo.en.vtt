00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 are left are not of this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 new visitable was football manager 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.940
 today that up to the shoes of Oronzo Canà vi 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 show how the module works a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 butterfly on 3 2 2 2 1 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.020
 I tell you right away that I won't stop for 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 nothing about player training 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.380
 I'll show you just that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.990
 field arrangement and this defenders 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.289
 midfielders midfielders midfielders 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 central wings is a striker just like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 arrows I would certainly propose to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.610
 put these two though you can too 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 taking them off is not something compulsory 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 regarding offensive orders 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.559
 all the bands and two mid-normal range 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 mix zone because I make a video like that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
 quickly then first of all vi 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.489
 I meant that I didn't want to leave you at 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 dry video so as I said 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 on the page I have not forgotten you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.649
 you are recording it after you have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.969
 wrote that sentence and then see a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 po you that now is however I wanted you with 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.579
 this video will show how much the module 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 butterfly is a pretty way 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.150
 we say neutral with regard to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 teams that affect it are the teams 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.619
 which, in my opinion, affects it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.780
 honestly it is a very offensive module 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.659
 if you have strong enough players 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.689
 because it is excellent with narrow defenses 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 teams with wings because the wings 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.979
 first block here we say in one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 hypothetical starting and then blocking it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.500
 here and also here therefore said this vi 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 I can say which formations are that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.350
 so contrast the butterfly 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 surely there are 4 5 1 and 5 4 2 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.750
 this is because the 5 4 1 4 5 1 year in 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 midfield and too thick a defense 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.799
 so there is too much coverage on the part of 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.000
 midfielders and s70 defenders well 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.960
 totally neutralize ours 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.829
 training 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.079
 then we have the 4 3 3 that we say one 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.049
 team par excellence that succeeds in 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.270
 lock the butterfly module because i 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.360
 four let's say the four defenders 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 block our midfield 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.180
 the three midfielders block 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.410
 the three attackers restart unfortunately 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.290
 we are lethal for our defense 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.140
 so against 4 3 3 make sure you don't 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 play with the butterfly module mi 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 it will seem strange but with the 3 4 3 instead 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.250
 but we are talking about this later 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
 later it may seem that too 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.330
 strange the 4 3 1 2 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.069
 because the 4 3 1 2 excellent against the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.260
 butterfly form simply because 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.620
 they have this player here have the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.190
 mcmc you will notice if you use it in short if 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 you will use this training 4 3 1 2 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.620
 you will notice that the healthy mc is the fulcrum of the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.200
 game of the opposing team 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.350
 you risk to suffer more goals from the mc 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.470
 that from the various attackers so there 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.660
 I do not recommend it highly, however we know that every 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.670
 let's say each its coin its side 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.209
 its negative is positive 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.209
 then it is the positive side of 322 21 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.480
 certainly the number of 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.540
 formations that our module suffers 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.780
 let's start immediately with the 4 3 2 1 è 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.670
 basically a difficult module to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.060
 contrast or at least a form 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.820
 with which it is difficult to score however 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.680
 ensures you are insured on the field 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.870
 defensive because it will fail to do 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.230
 an action the fact that we say to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.500
 Christmas tree 4 3 2 1 both at the tree 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.470
 Christmas will freeze everything here not 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.320
 will be able to get in the door then if 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.840
 you have to say to protect a result 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.070
 I recommend this training against the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.780
 3 5 2 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.019
 since they have a pretty midfield 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.239
 thicker than 4 5 1 and 5 4 1 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.829
 having a large midfield will be enough for you 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.459
 the long throw 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.560
 then you can do from the orders 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.519
 goal transition let's say in the center 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 with a high pass style contrast 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.380
 long we are yes and long passage e 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.510
 let's play with this same midfield 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.540
 it was only for 3 4 3 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.120
 Here because 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.310
 a midfield at 4 you just need a throw 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.170
 long to say block or for 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.930
 counter this training 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.640
 I remind you of what the three attackers are 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.830
 of 3 4 3 they do very badly 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.270
 so in this case with the 3 4 3 la 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.740
 team mentality will have to go on 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.870
 normal because too offensive then 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.170
 we are too unbalanced then 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:47.610
 remember in the end we have the 3 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.760
 1 4 2 which has a mc position made me 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.120
 understand to tell a nc totally 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.420
 useless so they will play as if 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.470
 had less names and will be a 3 4 2 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.140
 what does 3 4 3 launch long and lo 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.270
 we disintegrated also goes well with 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.030
 the 32 32 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.910
 this because it will always allow us to 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.350
 have flaws free bands this 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.850
 because we say 32 32 is a weapon a 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.400
 double cut not so much because not 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.840
 we will succeed in winning that is safe 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.550
 however we will not follow much with 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.220
 the attacker the attacker will be 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.920
 totally blocked but we will have wings 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.630
 free so I recommend to the powerful 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:37.010
 who know how to pull out because we will have 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:41.820
 so much space finally who is who not 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.460
 he suffers or attacks those who are neutral 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.670
 in the way the butterfly simply 4 4 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.350
 2 classic is the classic what I 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.350
 when I play the games 4 4 2 classic 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.700
 does not suffer because in the end it is one 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.470
 budget issue that is 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.650
 balance the two formations anyway 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.060
 summarizing which teams are hurting 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:06.450
 the 32 22 14 51 and 541 because they are too much 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.660
 4 3 3 blankets because midfield and 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.840
 defense block us 4 3 1 2 because of her 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.510
 mc that makes us the ass who suffers instead 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.050
 with the 3 2 2 2 1 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.700
 certainly the 4 3 2 1 because in which 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.590
 this one more than an exception 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.200
 we will oppose it but we will have problems with 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.770
 assign excellent if you want to keep the 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.790
 result 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.980
 3 5 2 or 3 4 3 throw along doing 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.620
 be careful though with 3 4 3 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.170
 to the three at the three opposing points 31 42 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.780
 same reasoning as in 3 4 3 3 2 3 2 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.490
 we will have free bands concluding me 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.020
 I mean I hope that anyway 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.640
 this episode of you enjoyed is a 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.080
 unlike others let me know that 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.530
 what you think is above all 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.560
 recommend me some training from 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.100
 view leaving white of course 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.080
 the position of all players 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.280
 I hope these pools are 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.810
 liked let me in the comments that 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.720
 what do you think what they would say not 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.240
 soprana if he saw the 555 form format 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.130
 butterfly 322 21 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.350
 we'll see you at the next eleven video 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.760
 and hopefully the game 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.560
 I hope to be able to do it immediately though 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.850
 unfortunately well university commitments 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.610
 games but always put in the morning 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.710
 jodi I have serious problems to register I'll see 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.960
 what can I do the very last thing do me 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.490
 know if you want to see the video or 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.050
 another video of the purchase campaign 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.910
 we still have 28 to waste 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.460
 we have some players to change 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.800
 let loose these wine that I have them 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.440
 put because I needed not to have 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.690
 in short, this triangular position 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.890
 players then drawn concluding vi 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.210
 I say I hope these episodes are there 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.920
 the next video grew in theaters 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.920
 of beautiful level mice
