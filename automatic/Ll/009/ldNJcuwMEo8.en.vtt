00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
tablespoons so I'm thinking if you go

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
tablespoons so I'm thinking if you go
over<00:01:14.430> 2<00:01:14.760> tbsp<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:15.930> type<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
over 2 tbsp there is some type of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.460 
over 2 tbsp there is some type of
calorie<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
calorie in there but it's not much this
