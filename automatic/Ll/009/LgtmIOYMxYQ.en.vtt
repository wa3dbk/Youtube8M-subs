00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
eyes again right there and then it has

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.370 
eyes again right there and then it has
like<00:01:32.290> eyebrows<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.610> guess<00:01:34.540> was<00:01:34.810> what<00:01:35.230> they're

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
like eyebrows I guess was what they're

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.930 
like eyebrows I guess was what they're
trying<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.710> go<00:01:35.800> for<00:01:36.010> for<00:01:36.310> these<00:01:36.490> green<00:01:36.730> pieces

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
trying to go for for these green pieces

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.670 
trying to go for for these green pieces
right<00:01:37.210> here<00:01:37.680> um<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:39.640> then<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:41.110> head<00:01:41.409> is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
right here um and then the head is

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.570 
right here um and then the head is
actually<00:01:42.010> not<00:01:42.130> reposition<00:01:43.500> repositionable

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
actually not reposition repositionable

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.030 
actually not reposition repositionable
because<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.730> head<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.870> head<00:01:47.140> main<00:01:47.740> piece

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
because the head the head main piece

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.320 
because the head the head main piece
goes<00:01:48.370> all<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.580> way<00:01:48.760> back<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.240> here<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:51.330> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
goes all the way back to here but the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.219 
goes all the way back to here but the
tail<00:01:53.520> obviously<00:01:54.520> can<00:01:54.790> band<00:01:55.540> in<00:01:55.780> these<00:01:55.990> three

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
tail obviously can band in these three

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.520 
tail obviously can band in these three
parts<00:01:56.590> except<00:01:57.010> from<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.550> part<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.900> goes<00:01:59.350> up

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
parts except from this part it goes up

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.320 
parts except from this part it goes up
and<00:01:59.680> down<00:01:59.770> like<00:01:59.860> this

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.160 

and<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.110> right<00:02:03.320> here<00:02:03.670> it's<00:02:04.670> Tim's<00:02:05.330> can<00:02:05.840> twist

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
and then right here it's Tim's can twist

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.060 
and then right here it's Tim's can twist
this<00:02:06.380> way<00:02:06.970> or<00:02:07.970> move<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.690> way<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:12.070> then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
this way or move this way and then

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.020 
this way or move this way and then
there's<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.850> nice<00:02:14.620> green<00:02:15.620> scaling<00:02:16.190> design<00:02:16.520> all

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
there's a nice green scaling design all

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.520 
there's a nice green scaling design all
the<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.290> thing<00:02:20.260> except<00:02:21.260> for

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the way down the thing except for

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.130 
the way down the thing except for
there's<00:02:21.800> nothing<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.570> I'm<00:02:23.570> not<00:02:23.870> sure<00:02:24.020> if

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
there's nothing on here I'm not sure if

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.270 
there's nothing on here I'm not sure if
they<00:02:24.230> were<00:02:24.290> supposed<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.040> anything<00:02:25.720> yeah

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
they were supposed to be anything yeah

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.100 
they were supposed to be anything yeah
but<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> way<00:02:28.550> they<00:02:28.730> make<00:02:28.910> these<00:02:29.060> tail<00:02:29.570> feet<00:02:29.960> by

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
but the way they make these tail feet by

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.370 
but the way they make these tail feet by
the<00:02:30.140> way<00:02:30.320> these<00:02:30.500> are<00:02:30.560> also<00:02:30.860> repositionable

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
the way these are also repositionable

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.190 
the way these are also repositionable
but<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.950> way<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.730> part<00:02:35.090> works<00:02:36.220> um<00:02:37.220> it's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
but the way this part works um it's

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.250 
but the way this part works um it's
basically<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:40.450> move<00:02:41.450> these<00:02:41.660> out<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> way

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.170 

as<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.650> see<00:02:45.860> it's<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.400> 2<00:02:46.580> x<00:02:46.760> 1<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:49.000> 6<00:02:50.000> x

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
as you can see it's just a 2 x 1 and 6 x

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.440 
as you can see it's just a 2 x 1 and 6 x
ones<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.700> then<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.940> flat<00:02:53.180> piece

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
ones like that and then the flat piece

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.270 
ones like that and then the flat piece
