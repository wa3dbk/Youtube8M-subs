contributing<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.050> go<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> problem

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
contributing if you go to the problem

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
contributing if you go to the problem
because<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.300> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.970> hard<00:01:17.970> surfaces

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because if if you have hard surfaces

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240 
because if if you have hard surfaces
basically<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> absorbs<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> heat<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
basically it absorbs the heat and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
basically it absorbs the heat and
creates<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> divine<00:01:21.690> either<00:01:21.840> island<00:01:22.229> effect

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that adds to it it's going to be ugly
