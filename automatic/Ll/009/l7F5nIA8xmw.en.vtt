00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.889
 I sing, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:12.585
 Thanks a lot 

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.186
 I'm really sick and tired of getting dragged everywhere 

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:18.715
 -Whoa! You are the biggest orange I've ever seen! 

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.434
 -What? I'm not orange. 

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.384
 "You will be my big brother! 

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:24.102
 "I'm not your brother. - Yes, you are. 

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:25.817
 I'm orange, you're orange 

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.277
 We are both oranges 

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.304
 - I'm not orange, I'm a pumpkin 

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.672
 -Pumpkin? Do not you mean "pair"? 

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.830
 [Laughs] You're huge! 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.037
 "Ha, ha, ha, ha, that's really funny 

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.427
 - Hey, Enck! - It's a pumpkin 

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:41.285
 - Hey, Enck! - It's a pumpkin 

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:42.957
 -What? "How did you become so dumb?" 

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:45.047
 [Laughs] - [Wall] 

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.533
 - Hey, Plkkin, do you want to see a trick? 

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.508
 -Not exactly. 

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:49.180
 - [chest, laughs] 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.363
 - Yeah, that's not even a trick 

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:53.452
 - Hey, Enck! - It's a pumpkin! 

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.078
 - Hey, Enck! -What? 

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:56.935
 - Can you touch your eyes with your tongue? 

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.654
 No. You have not done it before. 

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.233
 Try it! Errl .. 

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.022
 - I do not want to try it. 

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:04.523
 - Erl ... almost. Errl 

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:05.666
 - Would you stop this? 

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.152
 - I almost got it 

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:09.242
 - Oree, take it off 

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:10.696
 -You do not try. 

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.189
 Oh, my God, stop! -What? 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.284
 "You know, I'm a pretty quiet man most of the time, 

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.626
 And it takes a lot to tear me, 

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.716
 But you, you make me crazy, 

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:20.620
 And I was just here ... what ?! 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.920
 Do not shut up! 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.876
 And that's a pumpkin! pumpkin 

00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:27.121
 It's not an orange, not a Pumpkin, and I'm not your brother 

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.607
 What? What is? 

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.022
 Why are you muttering and doing that person? 

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.759
 -Not. -Huh? 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.316
 [Screams] 

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.685
 "Someone has to take that man's knife 

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:40.728
 Just in the head 

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:42.446
 Oh, no, he tears your intestines 

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:43.933
 - [screaming in agony] 

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.741
 Hey! Hey, Plkkin 

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.459
 Hey, Pickling! Hey! 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.502
 Hey Plymkin, 

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:53.592
 Someone carved a face on your ass. 

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:59.072
 [laughing] 

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:00.837
 Oh ... 

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:01.914
 Hey, who showed the lights? 

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:10.130
