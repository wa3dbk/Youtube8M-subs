00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
than these engine stands which is pretty

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
than these engine stands which is pretty
cool<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.480> anyway<00:00:37.050> cuz<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:37.469> never

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

cool I think anyway cuz I've never
really<00:00:37.980> made<00:00:38.160> anything<00:00:38.690> like<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.590> myself

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
about I don't know four or five days now

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
about I don't know four or five days now
I<00:00:59.449> really<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.770> but<00:01:01.770> yeah<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> things

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I really don't know but yeah the things

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.719 
I really don't know but yeah the things
holding<00:01:03.270> fine<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.430> seems<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> work<00:01:05.580> quite

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
holding fine and it seems to work quite

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
holding fine and it seems to work quite
well<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:08.450> yeah<00:01:09.450> here's<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> front<00:01:10.020> they

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
well so yeah here's the front they

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.100 
well so yeah here's the front they
attach<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:13.580> sway<00:01:14.580> bar<00:01:14.820> mounts<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> believe

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
attach to the sway bar mounts I believe

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.920 
attach to the sway bar mounts I believe
that's<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.619> those<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that's what those are and then it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
that's what those are and then it
attaches<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
attaches in the back and where the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
attaches in the back and where the
bumper<00:01:21.570> attaches<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> cool<00:01:22.920> thing

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
bumper attaches to but the cool thing

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
bumper attaches to but the cool thing
about<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.990> when<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.290> out

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
about this is that when you take out

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.060 
about this is that when you take out
these<00:01:26.009> pins<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.970> both<00:01:27.479> sides<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.619> can

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
these pins on both sides then you can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
these pins on both sides then you can
you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.220> rotate<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> car<00:01:30.240> around

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you know rotate the car around

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
you know rotate the car around
can't<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.970> rotate<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.180> there

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
can't really rotate it in there

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.640 
can't really rotate it in there
obviously<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> pins<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.500> there

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
obviously because the pins are in there

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.300 
obviously because the pins are in there
but<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.020> will<00:01:37.170> definitely<00:01:37.530> let<00:01:38.250> me

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but you know this will definitely let me

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.270 
but you know this will definitely let me
actually<00:01:38.610> walk<00:01:39.390> under<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> car<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:41.130> able

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
actually walk under the car and be able

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.590 
actually walk under the car and be able
to<00:01:41.369> get<00:01:41.520> under<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.030> without<00:01:42.180> having<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to get under there without having to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.749 
to get under there without having to
crawl<00:01:42.810> around<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> ground<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:43.860> isn't

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
crawl around on the ground which isn't

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.539 
crawl around on the ground which isn't
fun<00:01:45.470> welding<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> bottom<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.340> going

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
fun welding on the bottom is now going

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
fun welding on the bottom is now going
to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.820> quite<00:01:48.420> easy<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.500> move<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to be quite easy I can actually move the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
to be quite easy I can actually move the
car<00:01:50.189> around<00:01:50.549> instead<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.360> having<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.689> B

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
car around instead of just having a B

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
car around instead of just having a B
and<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:53.040> spot<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> jack<00:01:54.119> stand<00:01:54.390> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and the one spot on the jack stand that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.039 
and the one spot on the jack stand that
it's<00:01:54.720> been<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.229> several<00:01:55.710> months<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it's been for several months and it is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's been for several months and it is
pretty<00:01:58.320> neat<00:01:58.530> but<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> guess<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.009> time

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
pretty neat but so now I guess it's time

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.450 
pretty neat but so now I guess it's time
to<00:02:02.189> finally<00:02:03.530> remove<00:02:04.530> all<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:04.920> last<00:02:05.250> little

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to finally remove all those last little

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.130 
to finally remove all those last little
wires<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.210> bits<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:08.810> start<00:02:09.810> cleaning

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wires and bits and then start cleaning

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
wires and bits and then start cleaning
up<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.440> oh<00:02:10.679> yeah<00:02:11.039> I've<00:02:11.220> got<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.489> parts<00:02:11.849> that
