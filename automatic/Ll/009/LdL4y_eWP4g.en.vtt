00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.970
 cardi dogs is fine but it's you I say 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.220
 after training on the safest though 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.130
 also because it makes the conference earlier 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.320
 but i can also play you can do it all 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.720
 everything in life is important 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.330
 that both are in condition 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.620
 this is above all know what it is 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.910
 right for the team 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.399
 what i want from them yes i saw 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.480
 I too have seen that being is 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.500
 better respect is still very loaded with 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.170
 work 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.910
 from this point of view we are not at 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.469
 the knee is much better 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.600
 knee holds I think the more time 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.340
 more passes he will be better now 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.009
 I told you already must find the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.840
 sensations as a footballer also because 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.380
 there is also a particular physicist in the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.450
 sense of good-looking under this 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.310
 point of view therefore would receive 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.909
 need to play consistently 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.500
 train consistently but I leave 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.180
 always assuming you have more 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.640
 possibility if you prepare it well at 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.110
 match and this week was one 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.670
 the week was a little unusual 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.200
 like the pride of having so many 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.990
 national and feedback players 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.180
 there is the fact that maybe he would do me 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 nice to keep them here because we had to do 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.110
 an important match 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.650
 many times we try to combine the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.460
 two things 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.990
 we hope it goes well 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.450
 but I think our path is 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:58.750
 traced in the sense of replacing it 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.640
 dogfish and who will replace dogfish will do 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.880
 he will do his part as he did as he has 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.460
 done here for us a lot is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.680
 a watershed match this already in the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.810
 sense that we come from good performance and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.120
 if we keep doing good performance 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.930
 maybe together the results we approach 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.940
 first to ours to our goal if 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.010
 we will not face this game that ed 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.519
 it was extreme with the attitude 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.890
 right can become the game 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.880
 insidious and our championship is 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.590
 puts 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.010
 in another way for di sansone 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.180
 stranger rodriguez brigade because also 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 even if I do n't know neither foreign 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.110
 the boy the boy came there 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.850
 they speak Spanish are also not what 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.680
 I tell him I do not know if they tell you things 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.250
 I want to tell him the things I do 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.250
 they want them 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.690
 but he looks like a boy to me 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.780
 just awake that there is need is a little 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 However, I have seen that he knows 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 play football then also gods 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.870
 players beyond the language of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.100
 skin color of the age are divided 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 mistakes those who know how to play 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.650
 those who are a little so-so and he me 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.240
 seems from the first from the first category 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.970
 so I think its inclusion 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.280
 will happen in a short time and instead 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.170
 on the speech of Sansone speech of 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.870
 sansone who has to readjust or not 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.330
 new type of preparation especially 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.830
 he has to adapt too he knows what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:45.580
 I will expect a strong team 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.420
 because the rome is a strong team and me 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.650
 I wait for a strong team squad that 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.300
 will want to reverse this negative trend e 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.630
 so we know we are playing against one 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.360
 team against a strong team 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:08.040
 I know I know the environment I know 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.040
 pressure is on the other hand 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.269
 his is the bicycle he has to pedal on 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:17.289
 certain squares and you have to hold it too 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.060
 I do n't even know why 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.850
 game that does so I don't know that 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.729
 intentions already to their coach 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.900
 I hope that I know I will play against 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.599
 the strong team 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.039
 I hope we play with it 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.949
 same attitude as the latter 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.539
 more weeks also because in these in 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.460
 this category 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.320
 if not at least at Rome 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.599
 Florentine if Florentine to Lazio 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.849
 that is, it is not that you say now it is called with 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.820
 the strong team then we recover there 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.560
 we rest there are other championships that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.470
 there are three or four strong teams and the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.580
 others a little less in Italy we have seen 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.580
 also that you can lose with siena 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.280
 vice versa that is in the sense of gender the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.020
 genoa that beats butt and beats it to 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.520
 This is the Italian league 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.520
 so you always have to stay on the piece
