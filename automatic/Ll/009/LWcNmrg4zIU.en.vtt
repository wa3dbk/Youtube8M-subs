00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.410
 everything in the girls as they are 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.190
 good this time as you can see extracted with video is this that I bring 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.099
 here 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 Kennedy pointed out that they do not reach in that in common 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.339
 as each step is designated 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.359
 if they have given us pumpkins this one has decided nothing 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.009
 then this one this design is super super super super easy 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.029
 in this tournament and already in Spain of any designs 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.390
 there are different types 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.460
 I always practiced on a nail 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.730
 there is a nail this state 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 because because I want to see how it comes out of the design 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 and then says this man is not like that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.600
 fox 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 I did it to whom 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.390
 and in this union 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.130
 this was the result that nobody feline 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.130
 and in workshops, peace be my hands 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.050
 then this one 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.290
 is the design created see as I said is super easy 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.300
 It's just that I'm not going to do it to anyone who has one of those 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.140
 I have here 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.700
 because I put it in my hands then I'm going to do it in the world yet and there we are 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.150
 of these and me 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.710
 and I'm going to do it here so you can not watch video, you can see it's a 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.920
 it's something super super super super easy 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.430
 and well I'm going to give the union 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 and I'm going to apply this orange color that is here 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.600
 is called 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 the eei show 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 again in the field of vélez the exhibition 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 it's an orange color 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.940
 and I'm going to apply the covers that would be analyzed what to do step by step 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.479
 so they do not realize that they said easy but that nothing is nothing 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.640
 complicated 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.010
 I'm going to remove 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.420
 I'm going to apply this layer as necessary 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.919
 percent for this year because in two stages 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.699
 we will wait 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.709
 30 seconds between each country cappa 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.909
 give him how 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.779
 time for him to be here 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 then it was between kpk homeland let's 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.419
 reapply 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.439
 something like that 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.789
 where you can see how it looks 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.009
 something like that 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.019
 and then we're just going to wait, we do not have to let ourselves fall completely 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.580
 let's be like that 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.019
 wait a few seconds for 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.749
 to wait for him to stay and let's see 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:07.989
 ap to start painting the school 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.929
 the face highlights the mass 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.929
 of this angry pumpkin 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.819
 then let's go to 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
 let's do this 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.489
 As I told you, well, well, well, well, easy, 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.529
 then they are not sown in reaching it 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:35.979
 then the first semester 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.759
 and let's start doing it 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.869
 the capital we are going to make an eye-shaped triangle 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:02.059
 it does not have to fit perfectly but 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.439
 good 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.079
 a little point here 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.079
 simulating your nose 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.119
 and this finished his mouth 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.299
 Privacy 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.299
 they see that it is not as well as more complicated 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 it's something like that if you want 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.749
 now let's put a phone number 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 we'll see 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.059
 they applied green 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.529
 to simulate its 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.370
 to simulate sound 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.370
 uses the life of the pumpkin this 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.409
 5 million to have a punch 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.409
 then I will apply another green 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.059
 sometimes it's a worked 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.059
 because I do not apply the green in this part of ekin 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 simply simulating the pumpkin's tail 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.569
 that girl is 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.789
 would be all this would no longer be base option to what I'm going to put 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.789
 will make it be digit of the nit 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.809
 and how will I apply it 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:42.499
 in fact from here only here is a little bit complicated not 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:44.659
 because I want to put his eyes 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.829
 here in Merida the triangle that you see as well as numerous 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.210
 so what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.360
 ap here I am ellis as I say is optional go grab 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.680
 and already lead to look only a gap to a myth 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.949
 and they're going to put it here on it in the middle of the triangle 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:10.659
 simulating the eye 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.659
 so that they are bright eyes 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.110
 let's do the same with the other 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.110
 trying is just to put a name 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.860
 they are ready 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400
 the onu do not put it in milk 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.219
 and that will do something like that design 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:45.629
 and finally we mentioned to put a stopper I'm going to put this beni 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.339
 and I'm going to apply 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.300
 and physical event would be all how they can realize this decision 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.199
 it's something super super super super super easy 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.639
 we can not do anything 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:08.199
 in a few minutes 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.199
 and I have style 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.839
 I hope you liked it here and we will be seeing 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:21.279
 ee another asks hunter did sport 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.559
 look 

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.559
 rate i in this century 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.710
 good while 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.509
 I hope you like it and we are not seeing in another language Chávez Chica this Saturday
