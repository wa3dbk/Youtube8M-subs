00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.390
 have you already ordered the restaurant without knowing what you had to eat 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.030
 hot if the idea is original alain to the monks an atypical chef who plays 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.250
 conventions with a lot of spices of all kinds he mixes 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.930
 flavors and if you never know what you're going to eat with Alain's cuisine 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.460
 we can taste with closed eyes this art lover has only one ambition 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 surprise his clients and make them travel 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.100
 we had a lot of a lot of love a lot of soul in the order 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.849
 it feels 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.849
 it feels like a customer the word client do you feel it fillon 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.210
 it's a game between us it's more than I come to the table you chose 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.100
 a long series here 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 in fact all choosing customers will choose 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.840
 this is the challenge of fine dining that best represented with a tariff 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.570
 we do not really know what we are going to eat and afp 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.970
 so we go back a little bit before 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.670
 in conversation with his client but differently 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.300
 for regulars no wonder indeed to order a small extract 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.370
 yet some like it hot 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.610
 in his kitchen alain costes who films his menus while we forgot 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 everything you know and let yourself be carried 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.510
 a child on the internet and warm for a Bernese 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 for him indeed that I'm going to make spices of course 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.570
 opened since this summer said in the middle a new wave on 38 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.189
 federates its customers wherever they come from these do not dry up 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.600
 of praise for the chef and his cuisine 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.410
 I thought it was not a record 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.180
 in excellent e rank the propeller was really a real festival for 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.130
 buds 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 it is found in more than 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.160
 henri iv long term of 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 half declined on the film 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.630
 this is the first time I eat that I take the bus to know that the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.570
 eat finally bend 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.230
 as long as to know paradise as much become of this degree 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.150
 this little phrase of the chef and perfectly illustrates his restaurant or 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.570
 heard after a good dinner it will take the time you enjoy the most
