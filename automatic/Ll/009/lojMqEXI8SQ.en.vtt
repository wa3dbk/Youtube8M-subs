00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:05.149
 you see it aena with 37 minutes the really alarming figure at least 50 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.080
 people are run over daily only here in the capital the imprudence 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.279
 both pedestrians and drivers 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.010
 they were the main causes 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.590
 I can because many times we see that it is not only the vehicle that can go 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.810
 excessive speed 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.640
 what we do not realize that the card as talking the one that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.869
 we are there 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 responsible for that country 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's see that effect 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.150
 the pedestrian bridge is a threat without eating 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.180
 however some tourist pedestrians madrid 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 find easier faster more comfortable 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.800
 and over there fighting the helmets we have regulation 14 pedestrian infractions 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.300
 but that do not apply we have to enforce 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.690
 because the laments on sale establishes the interruption of the trip which is a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 warning a wake-up call does not have any consequence 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.489
 the pedestrian a world 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
 can be a user as they could and nothing happens 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.110
 something unfortunately death when it happens that the cofetel every day are 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.120
 run over 50 people only in the month of December 72% of deaths in 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.100
 tracks and roads is produced by an accident of every 10 accidents that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.360
 They happen in the city 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.159
 this solution 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.690
 they die for some kind of traffic accident 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.210
 eight are pedestrians 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.039
 and what happens when a driver trying to avoid the ing 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.610
 the dizzyingly reckless chance though 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.820
 and could also have fatal victims 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 it does not happen 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.249
 the infraction in the text gets involved 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.090
 and is practically the mother of the lamb 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.230
 on February 3 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.230
 speeding the place 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.140
 the frequent serious accidents 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.770
 a fact that is also at least remarkable 25% of the trips of 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.080
 the enemy lines and hacienda 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.220
 while almost the entire road infrastructure will be built to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.670
 the cars when we go to the area we observe that nobody is busy 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.359
 literally by vehicles and itinerants 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.469
 this momentary solution 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.519
 how can we require pedestrians who circulate to transit properly in 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.250
 the cities and that not all the right steps and in the scarcest areas 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:29.259
 resources the most dynamic 36% walks in the doubles is still less 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.259
 important for teachers 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 socially it is understood of crisis that happens men a pedestrian 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.209
 the vehicle you can follow from the pedestrian you have is a behavior that 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.209
 you share that yes before culturally and socially standing 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.759
 at least in Lima 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.219
 that the vehicle has the priority 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.689
 over the city 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.679
 s the theater is an element of history 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.199
 the solution proposed by the technical secretariat of the transport council of 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.259
 lima and callao is taking more into account the details we know well the huge 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.419
 road works thing that jumps at sight has not been done
