I'm<00:00:00.870> sitting<00:00:01.199> here<00:00:01.290> looking<00:00:02.210> met<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.480> live

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
I'm sitting here looking met the live

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.809 
I'm sitting here looking met the live
data<00:00:03.929> here<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.470> looking<00:00:04.589> at<00:00:04.890> oxygen

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
data here and I'm looking at oxygen

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.620 
data here and I'm looking at oxygen
sensor<00:00:06.240> number<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.109> number<00:00:07.230> two<00:00:08.030> and<00:00:09.030> I'm

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
sensor number one and number two and I'm

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.959 
sensor number one and number two and I'm
happy<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> notice<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:11.309> can't<00:00:11.550> see<00:00:11.849> my

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
happy to notice that you can't see my

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
happy to notice that you can't see my
arms<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.450> way<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:12.750> something's<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.440> on

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
arms in a way or something's going on

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.340

the<00:00:20.480> voltage<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:23.210> IC<00:00:24.210> fluctuating<00:00:25.019> but

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the voltage is IC fluctuating but

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.790 
the voltage is IC fluctuating but
sometime<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.800> drop<00:00:26.039> down<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.279> zero<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:27.260> in<00:00:28.260> zero

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
sometime we drop down to zero as in zero

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.030 
sometime we drop down to zero as in zero
point<00:00:29.189> zero<00:00:29.310> zero<00:00:29.580> zero<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.040> looked

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
point zero zero zero you know I looked

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.440 
point zero zero zero you know I looked
up<00:00:35.160> before<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> can't<00:00:35.880> remember<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
up before I can't remember what the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.220 
up before I can't remember what the
actual<00:00:36.780> range<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.489> but<00:00:38.570> let<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.690> give<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> about

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
actual range is but let me give it about

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.700 
actual range is but let me give it about
I<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:42.300> hard<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.110> percentage<00:00:43.559> on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I is hard to do when I'm percentage on

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
I is hard to do when I'm percentage on
here<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.329> give<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.510> bit<00:00:45.629> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
here but give it a little bit of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.440 
here but give it a little bit of
throttle<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.230> you'll<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.450> bottle

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
throttle here you'll see a bottle

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.970 
throttle here you'll see a bottle
position<00:00:48.870> sensor

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:04.969 

how<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.490> get<00:00:52.670> around<00:00:52.760> 6%

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:18.219 

and<00:01:05.610> give<00:01:05.789> us<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.030> more

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.289 

I<00:01:22.420> don't<00:01:23.420> really<00:01:23.630> know<00:01:23.869> if<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:24.229> if<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.799> if<00:01:25.759> an

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
I don't really know if this if the if an

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.209 
I don't really know if this if the if an
oxygen<00:01:27.020> sensor<00:01:27.200> supposed<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.679> actually<00:01:27.979> read

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
oxygen sensor supposed to actually read

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:34.569 
oxygen sensor supposed to actually read
zero<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:33.079> doesn't<00:01:33.439> always<00:01:33.710> supposed<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.100> be<00:01:34.159> in

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
zero it doesn't always supposed to be in

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.590 
zero it doesn't always supposed to be in
within<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.420> Pacific<00:01:35.600> range<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:37.600> second

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
within the Pacific range and the second

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.179 
within the Pacific range and the second
one<00:01:38.720> behind<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.259> catalytic<00:01:39.710> converter<00:01:40.009> is

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
one behind the catalytic converter is

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.429 
one behind the catalytic converter is
just<00:01:40.429> to<00:01:40.869> make<00:01:41.869> sure<00:01:42.079> that<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:44.020> cat<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.259> doing

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
just to make sure that the cat is doing

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.359 
just to make sure that the cat is doing
its<00:01:45.679> job<00:01:47.530> sorry<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.649> say<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:48.829> didn't<00:01:49.159> really

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
its job sorry to say I didn't really

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.460 
its job sorry to say I didn't really
drive<00:01:49.640> with<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:51.880> but<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.939> don't<00:01:53.149> think<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.630> an

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
drive with it but I don't think that an

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.429 
drive with it but I don't think that an
oxygen<00:01:55.039> sensor<00:01:55.220> would<00:01:55.549> do<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.170> although<00:01:57.170> it

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
oxygen sensor would do this although it

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.410 
oxygen sensor would do this although it
does<00:01:57.979> kind<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.399> make<00:01:58.459> sense<00:01:58.789> because<00:01:59.179> it

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
does kind of make sense because it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.139 
does kind of make sense because it
happens<00:02:00.009> really<00:02:01.009> when<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> car<00:02:01.459> has<00:02:01.849> been

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
happens really when the car has been

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.589 
happens really when the car has been
warm<00:02:03.459> that<00:02:04.459> means<00:02:04.489> the<00:02:04.789> sensor<00:02:05.119> was<00:02:05.209> to<00:02:05.420> be

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
warm that means the sensor was to be

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.949 
warm that means the sensor was to be
warm

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
warm

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.620 
warm
but<00:02:06.349> not<00:02:06.500> when<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.770> cold<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:10.390> yeah<00:02:11.390> this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
but not when this cold so yeah this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.339 
but not when this cold so yeah this
abuse<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.140> check<00:02:12.349> out<00:02:12.530> honestly<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.849> not

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
abuse on the check out honestly have not

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.930 
abuse on the check out honestly have not
checked<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.620> mean<00:02:15.829> I<00:02:15.920> haven't<00:02:16.250> taken<00:02:16.610> and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
checked I mean I haven't taken and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.580 
checked I mean I haven't taken and
replaced<00:02:17.269> any<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.700> oxygen<00:02:19.700> sensors<00:02:20.150> yet

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
replaced any of the oxygen sensors yet

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.940 
replaced any of the oxygen sensors yet
since<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.739> got<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.069> car<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:24.400> 2008<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.829> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
since I got the car and 2008 so it is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.699 
since I got the car and 2008 so it is
still<00:02:28.190> running<00:02:28.430> here

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709
