00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.109
 we go with the largest tablet of the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.559
 two that were specifically presented 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.690
 we have the m1 8.0 a very tablet 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.160
 interesting with a quad-core processor 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.160
 let's see it in detail 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 well let's see the design of the average 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.779
 for 18.0 m you have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 guessed we have a screen of 8 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.500
 inches the truth is that the design is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 Pretty eye-catching from the tablet 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.550
 Huawei, as you are seeing, we find 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 a large screen that occupies a large part 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 from the front front camera and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 one of the things that we liked the most 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.829
 as you are seeing we find the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.719
 speakers in the front something not 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
 very usual and that we like 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.070
 much if we go over a little we see one 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 of the edges completely smooth if we 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 let's go to the other side we find buttons 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 to go up lower volume also to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 lock and unlock the terminal in the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.719
 lower part we found the micro usb 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.300
 upper part destined for the jack of 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.699
 3.5 and in the back as you see 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 apart the screen printing we find the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.600
 main camera of this device one 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.970
 of the aspects that he had told us 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 and the most important is the issue of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 weight in this case we have 30 300 29 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 grams and only 7.8 millimeters of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 thickness 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 to review the explanations of this 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 terminal specifically the processor that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.229
 move this terminal is a 4 1 6 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 gigahertz silicon height and with you 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 a gig of ram in the aspect of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.759
 internal storage we find two 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.830
 versions of 8 and 16 gigas and some 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 of the most outstanding things are their 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.390
 extensive 4800 milliampere battery and the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 possibility as it could not be another 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.920
 connections mode 4g lte the following 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.869
 section is the software as you are 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.939
 watching the base android version about 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.030
 which is based on this terminal is the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.069
 version 4.2 point 2 also known 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.080
 as jelly beans obviously as 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.509
 usually the manufacturer usually does 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.819
 has a presentation layer that like 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.190
 you can see it works above 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.810
 android as you will all know it as 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.700
 you are watching we can move 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.929
 easily by the desks that to the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.119
 They will also serve as box of 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.250
 applications all applications and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.560
 widgets are included in these desktop 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.819
 if we do not have a box as such if 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.530
 you can if you want to see we can see 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.090
 also at the top like 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.020
 we have 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.210
 notifications we should only 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.460
 move from the top and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.650
 besides this we will have a fast 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.870
 and comfortable control of energy also in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.760
 this part of the concentrations also 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.920
 from this we can also manage the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.410
 multitasking in a very fast way like 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.580
 you are seeing here we can see all the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.540
 applications that are running on 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 background 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 we just have to move to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.860
 eliminate them and if we want to click here 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.020
 we will eliminate them all at once as 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.330
 you are looking at the screen of this one n1 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.000
 Huawei is 8 inches use 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.600
 Exact ips technology and resolution 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.190
 are 800 x 1280 something that we commented 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.410
 before and he calls us powerfully 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.239
 the attention are your speakers in the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.280
 front that the truth give us a 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.900
 very good listening experience if 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.820
 you want to know the jokes by courts 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.480
 we can say that concretely it is m 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.040
 one has 189 photographic section as 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.130
 you are seeing this time we have the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.530
 front camera of this in this m 1 and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.120
 if we move to the back the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.900
 obviously the most relevant camera 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.230
 we have a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.840
 of 5 megapixels capable of recording at full 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.220
 hd obviously and as you are seeing the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.220
 true the camera application 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.780
 personalized with some options 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.700
 really interesting that you already know 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.450
 many of you like for example the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.450
 option to access
