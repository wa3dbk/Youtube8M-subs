was actually built in this building as
you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> plain<00:00:54.449> Jane

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and maybe that's why the car didn't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
and maybe that's why the car didn't
really<00:00:57.750> sell<00:00:57.989> real<00:00:58.199> well<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.129> it
