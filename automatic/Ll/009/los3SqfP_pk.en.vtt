00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.140 

the<00:00:10.080> greenhouse<00:00:10.530> as<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.340> see<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.880> now

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the greenhouse as you can see is now

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.259 
the greenhouse as you can see is now
completed<00:00:13.460> we've<00:00:14.460> installed<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.030> solar

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
completed we've installed the solar

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.540 
completed we've installed the solar
panel<00:00:16.490> producing<00:00:17.490> 80<00:00:17.880> watts<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.510> electricity

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
panel producing 80 watts of electricity

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.349 
panel producing 80 watts of electricity
made<00:00:20.550> by<00:00:20.760> sharp<00:00:22.010> mounted<00:00:23.010> between<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> two

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
rest of the greenhouse and they do a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.020 
rest of the greenhouse and they do a
really<00:03:33.540> nice<00:03:33.840> job<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.200> lighting<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.160> up<00:03:35.430> they

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
really nice job of lighting this up they

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.220 
really nice job of lighting this up they
are<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> medium<00:03:36.750> based<00:03:37.400> LED<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:39.360> use<00:03:39.630> about<00:03:39.900> 2

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
are a medium based LED they use about 2

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.290 
are a medium based LED they use about 2
watts<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.830> energy<00:03:41.550> per<00:03:42.350> bulb<00:03:43.350> if<00:03:43.680> six<00:03:44.370> bulbs<00:03:44.640> so

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
watts of energy per bulb if six bulbs so

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.170 
watts of energy per bulb if six bulbs so
2<00:03:48.300> or<00:03:48.420> 3<00:03:48.660> watts<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.080> can't<00:03:49.290> remember<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:50.180> very

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
2 or 3 watts I can't remember but very

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.390 
2 or 3 watts I can't remember but very
low<00:03:51.390> consumption<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.770> other<00:03:52.890> thing<00:03:53.190> that<00:03:53.220> I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
low consumption the other thing that I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.750 
low consumption the other thing that I
have<00:03:53.610> coming<00:03:53.820> off<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> battery<00:03:54.570> box<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:56.580> this

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
have coming off the battery box to this

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.240 
have coming off the battery box to this
control<00:03:57.330> here<00:03:57.750> which<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:59.120> control<00:04:00.120> that

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
degrees and off at 75 degrees and like I

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.370 
degrees and off at 75 degrees and like I
said<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.459> can<00:04:17.580> be<00:04:17.669> adjusted<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:19.109> follow

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
said that can be adjusted and we follow

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.760 
said that can be adjusted and we follow
that<00:04:19.709> up<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:21.810> see<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.410> goes<00:04:22.979> to

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
that up you can see that that goes to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.650 
that up you can see that that goes to
the<00:04:25.770> exhaust<00:04:26.700> fan<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.360> attached<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.540> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
the exhaust fan that is attached to the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.390 
the exhaust fan that is attached to the
cupola<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.180> simply<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.950> radiator<00:04:34.950> fan

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
cupola and this is simply a radiator fan

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.170 
cupola and this is simply a radiator fan
off<00:04:35.640> of<00:04:35.820> an<00:04:35.940> automobile<00:04:36.740> application<00:04:38.180> fifteen

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
off of an automobile application fifteen

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.860 
off of an automobile application fifteen
hundred<00:04:39.540> cubic<00:04:39.960> feet<00:04:40.169> per<00:04:40.229> minute<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:41.870> it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
hundred cubic feet per minute and it

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.350 
hundred cubic feet per minute and it
does<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:44.000> great<00:04:45.000> job

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.760 

and<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.660> course<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.110> other<00:04:50.259> thing<00:04:50.500> would<00:04:50.620> be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
and of course the other thing would be

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.689 
and of course the other thing would be
the<00:04:50.949> ceiling<00:04:51.400> fan<00:04:51.639> here<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:53.039> this<00:04:54.039> we've<00:04:54.490> got

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
the ceiling fan here and this we've got

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.300 
the ceiling fan here and this we've got
it<00:04:54.850> blowing<00:04:55.570> down<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.259> it<00:04:56.590> creates<00:04:57.039> a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
it blowing down and it creates a

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.550 
it blowing down and it creates a
circular<00:04:58.060> motion<00:04:58.270> blows<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.930> air<00:04:58.960> down<00:04:59.289> and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
circular motion blows the air down and

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.150 
circular motion blows the air down and
then<00:04:59.680> sucked<00:05:00.009> up<00:05:00.220> along<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.699> outside<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:01.330> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
then sucked up along the outside of the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.850 
then sucked up along the outside of the
the<00:05:03.160> walls<00:05:03.370> across<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.330> windows<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.900> out<00:05:05.050> out

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the walls across the windows and out out

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.610 
the walls across the windows and out out
the<00:05:06.039> roof<00:05:06.330> also<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:08.130> water<00:05:09.130> tank<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:11.139> all

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
the roof also the water tank is is all

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.150 
the roof also the water tank is is all
secured<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:14.289> thing<00:05:14.530> wouldn't<00:05:14.800> fall<00:05:14.979> away

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
secured this thing wouldn't fall away

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.240 
secured this thing wouldn't fall away
about<00:05:15.520> 450<00:05:16.479> pounds<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.199> it<00:05:18.039> really<00:05:18.550> has<00:05:18.759> to<00:05:18.789> be

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
about 450 pounds so it really has to be

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.020 
about 450 pounds so it really has to be
beefed<00:05:21.250> up<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:22.030> we<00:05:22.840> did<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.020> with<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:24.009> lot<00:05:24.910> of

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
beefed up and we did that with a lot of

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.230 
beefed up and we did that with a lot of
extra<00:05:25.300> two<00:05:25.479> by<00:05:25.630> fours<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:27.370> header<00:05:27.699> system

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
extra two by fours and I header system

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.469 
extra two by fours and I header system
and<00:05:28.449> tying<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.080> into<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.410> roof<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:31.300> works

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
and tying it into the roof and it works

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.870 
and tying it into the roof and it works
very<00:05:31.720> well<00:05:33.720> okay<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:35.410> last<00:05:35.650> part<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.400> would

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
very well okay the last part of it would

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.839 
very well okay the last part of it would
be<00:05:37.150> our<00:05:37.360> racking<00:05:38.169> system<00:05:38.590> here<00:05:38.889> and<00:05:39.099> either
