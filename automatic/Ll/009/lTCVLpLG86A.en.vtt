00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.880 
for The Simpsons at this point I think
that<00:02:04.799> would<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.600> probably<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.750> bad<00:02:07.439> career<00:02:07.680> move

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that would be probably a bad career move

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.290 
that would be probably a bad career move
because<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.489> would<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.789> give<00:02:08.940> up<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
because I would have to give up the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
because I would have to give up the
other<00:02:09.330> three<00:02:09.690> shows<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.739> work<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.160> but

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
other three shows that I work on but

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.280 
other three shows that I work on but
you<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.390> Matt<00:02:15.390> grannies<00:02:15.780> are<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.080> guys<00:02:16.260> so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you know Matt grannies are good guys so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.990 
you know Matt grannies are good guys so
if<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.830> had<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> ride<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.460> another<00:02:17.610> show<00:02:17.820> that'd

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
if I had to ride for another show that'd

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.210 
if I had to ride for another show that'd
be<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> good<00:02:18.210> one<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:19.350> many<00:02:19.440> voices<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> do

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
be a good one how many voices do you do

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.880 
be a good one how many voices do you do
on<00:02:20.370> Family<00:02:20.730> Guy<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:23.160> four<00:02:23.790> weekly<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.570> then

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
on Family Guy about four weekly and then

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.040 
on Family Guy about four weekly and then
per<00:02:25.890> episode<00:02:26.070> maybe<00:02:26.610> another<00:02:26.940> half-dozen<00:02:27.570> or

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
per episode maybe another half-dozen or

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.840 
per episode maybe another half-dozen or
so<00:02:28.080> now<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.100> guess<00:02:29.340> right<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> do<00:02:30.480> Peter
