00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
thing i don't like about this one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630

compared<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
compared to my other one is you have to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
compared to my other one is you have to
actually<00:01:14.729> reset<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> because

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
actually reset it when you do it because

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.609 
actually reset it when you do it because
lava<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.890> everywhere<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.229> it's<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
lava is everywhere and it's kind of a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.560 
lava is everywhere and it's kind of a
pain<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> ass<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.159> reset<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.060> i<00:01:21.240> thought

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pain in the ass to reset but i thought

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
pain in the ass to reset but i thought
it<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> cool<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> kill<00:01:22.439> people

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it was a cool way to kill people

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
it was a cool way to kill people
watching<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.580> slowly<00:01:24.170> bernadette<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.350> lava

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
watching them slowly bernadette by lava

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
watching them slowly bernadette by lava
was<00:01:25.950> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> interesting<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.060> opposed<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
was kind of interesting as opposed to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
was kind of interesting as opposed to
being<00:01:27.960> squished<00:01:28.320> er<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.490> any<00:01:30.000> of

was<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> said<00:01:50.790> there<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.240> I've

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
was like I said there was about I've

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.050 
was like I said there was about I've
missed<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.229> three<00:01:52.439> steps<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.850> actual

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
missed all three steps to this actual

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
missed all three steps to this actual
whatever<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.719> trap<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.979> first

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
whatever you want this trap is the first

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
whatever you want this trap is the first
one<00:01:59.399> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
one is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.850 
one is
getting<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> player<00:02:02.159> stuck<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> step<00:02:04.740> on

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
getting the player stuck so you step on

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.499 
getting the player stuck so you step on
this<00:02:04.979> plate<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> two<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.060> don't<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
this plate and two I don't want to I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
this plate and two I don't want to I
don't<00:02:06.600> want<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> let<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.079> ball<00:02:07.290> yet<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
don't want to let this ball yet but to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.510 
don't want to let this ball yet but to
pressure<00:02:08.910> plates<00:02:09.209> come<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:09.959> uh<00:02:10.520> too

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
pressure plates come out are too uh too

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.940 
pressure plates come out are too uh too
sticky<00:02:11.760> pistons<00:02:12.180> off<00:02:12.300> Wow<00:02:12.569> damn<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.590> let

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
sticky pistons off Wow damn it here let

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.059 
sticky pistons off Wow damn it here let
me<00:02:13.980> pause<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.000> clean<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.330> back<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:16.069> alright

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
me pause it and clean it back up alright

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 
me pause it and clean it back up alright
guys<00:02:17.250> i'm<00:02:17.459> back<00:02:17.489> sorry<00:02:17.940> about<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> i<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
guys i'm back sorry about that i just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800 
guys i'm back sorry about that i just
set<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.910> lava<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.269> not<00:02:21.420> following

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
set it up so the lava is not following

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.000 
set it up so the lava is not following
and<00:02:21.959> i'll<00:02:22.019> just<00:02:22.200> show<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.470> first<00:02:22.680> step<00:02:22.890> on

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and i'll just show you the first step on

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
and i'll just show you the first step on
its<00:02:23.190> own<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.519> first<00:02:23.730> step<00:02:23.849> without<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
its own so the first step without the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.000 
its own so the first step without the
lava<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.550> these<00:02:26.550> two<00:02:26.940> plates<00:02:27.840> getting<00:02:28.769> pushed

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
lava is these two plates getting pushed

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.050 
lava is these two plates getting pushed
in<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.310> i'm<00:02:29.459> going<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> show<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.760> how<00:02:29.849> that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
in and i'm going to show you how that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.270 
in and i'm going to show you how that
works<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:31.500> two<00:02:31.650> pressure<00:02:31.860> plates<00:02:32.130> are

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
works here these two pressure plates are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.490 
works here these two pressure plates are
both<00:02:32.430> attached<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.239> same<00:02:33.420> redstone<00:02:33.840> where<00:02:34.350> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
both attached the same redstone where it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.289 
both attached the same redstone where it
goes<00:02:34.590> from<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.970> over<00:02:36.239> and

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
goes from here and then one over and

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.180 
goes from here and then one over and
this<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.720> one<00:02:37.049> over<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:37.680> important

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
this this one over is very important

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.740 
this this one over is very important
because<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.090> watch<00:02:39.269> straight<00:02:39.480> up<00:02:39.630> from

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
because if you watch straight up from

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.059 
because if you watch straight up from
here<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.140> want<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.470> able<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> place<00:02:40.860> these

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
here you want to be able to place these

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.309 
here you want to be able to place these
blocks<00:02:41.400> here<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.819> hide<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.720> yeah<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.260> it

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
blocks here and hide it so yeah so it

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.289 
blocks here and hide it so yeah so it
needs<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.590> down<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.220> over<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.180> then

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
needs to be down one over one and then

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.160 
needs to be down one over one and then
up<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.549> so<00:02:47.549> from<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.569> goes<00:02:48.870> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
up one and so from here one goes this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.289 
up one and so from here one goes this
way<00:02:49.380> into<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.220> pressure<00:02:50.430> plate<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.180> not

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
way into this pressure plate and not

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.850 
way into this pressure plate and not
pressure<00:02:51.510> right<00:02:51.720> into<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.200> sticky<00:02:52.530> piston

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
pressure right into this sticky piston

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
pressure right into this sticky piston
and<00:02:53.010> then<00:02:53.880> one<00:02:54.000> goes<00:02:54.150> into<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.450> sticky

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and then one goes into this sticky

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.860 
and then one goes into this sticky
piston<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.549> see<00:02:56.549> I'm<00:02:56.670> pretty<00:02:56.849> simple<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.540> this

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
piston and see I'm pretty simple on this

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.050 
piston and see I'm pretty simple on this
side<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.560> some<00:02:58.709> stuck<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.250> as<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.940> can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
side it get some stuck and as you can

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.509 
side it get some stuck and as you can
see<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:00.360> they're<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:00.840> deployed<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:02.250> let's

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
see there they're all deployed now let's

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.120 
see there they're all deployed now let's
take<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.700> look<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.750> side<00:03:04.080> this<00:03:04.680> side<00:03:04.739> is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
take a look at this side this side is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.479 
take a look at this side this side is
the<00:03:05.220> side<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.459> controls<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:08.070> here<00:03:08.310> up

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
the side that controls this up here up

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.780 
the side that controls this up here up
there<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:10.620> one's<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.859> little<00:03:10.950> tricky

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
there so this one's a little tricky

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.449 
there so this one's a little tricky
because<00:03:12.269> as<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.200> without<00:03:13.799> me

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
because as you can see now without me

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.130 
because as you can see now without me
stepping<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.060> these<00:03:15.239> plate<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.690> this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
stepping on these plate this this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.380 
stepping on these plate this this
redstone<00:03:16.530> torches<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:17.940> step<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
redstone torches on but when I step it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.289 
redstone torches on but when I step it
on<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.780> redstone<00:03:19.410> torch<00:03:19.709> goes<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.370> that's

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
on it redstone torch goes out and that's

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.900 
on it redstone torch goes out and that's
just<00:03:21.600> wired<00:03:22.319> as<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.890> here<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.519> that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
just wired as you see here and that

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.270 
just wired as you see here and that
doesn't<00:03:24.150> need<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> yeah

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
doesn't need to be there and so yeah

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.309 
doesn't need to be there and so yeah
when<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.489> step<00:03:26.819> on<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.420> turns<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> torch<00:03:28.109> off

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
when I step on it it turns the torch off

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.840 
when I step on it it turns the torch off
because<00:03:28.680> when<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> torch<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.670> on

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
because when the torch is actually on

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.240 
because when the torch is actually on
its<00:03:30.510> firing<00:03:30.840> all<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.130> up

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
its firing all this up all the way up

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.530 
that pressure plate please yeah there
you<00:03:40.859> go<00:03:40.889> so<00:03:41.340> when<00:03:41.850> they're<00:03:42.030> off<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.359> pressure

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you go so when they're off the pressure

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.940 
you go so when they're off the pressure
plate<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:44.269> these<00:03:45.269> Pistons<00:03:46.139> are<00:03:46.350> deployed

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
plate the these Pistons are deployed

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.460 
plate the these Pistons are deployed
meaning<00:03:47.459> they're<00:03:47.609> pointing<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.470> because

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
meaning they're pointing out and because

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.849 
meaning they're pointing out and because
they<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:49.799> doing<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:51.680> allowing<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
they are doing that it's allowing the

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.720 
they are doing that it's allowing the
lava<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.370> stay<00:03:53.819> in<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.859> when<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:55.889> plate<00:03:56.340> them<00:03:56.489> let

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
lava to stay in so when I plate them let

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.309 
lava to stay in so when I plate them let
me<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:56.910> water<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.450> cuz<00:03:57.569> water<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.930> easier<00:03:58.290> to

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
me do water just cuz water is easier to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.180 
me do water just cuz water is easier to
handle<00:03:58.620> with

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
handle with

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.890 
handle with
let<00:03:59.280> me<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.520> Locker<00:04:00.260> water<00:04:01.310> right<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.730> no<00:04:03.600> I

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
right so now go step on the play and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.830 
right so now go step on the play and
I'll<00:04:07.980> show<00:04:08.160> them<00:04:08.220> what<00:04:08.340> happens<00:04:11.750> when<00:04:12.750> the

I'll show them what happens when the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.710 
I'll show them what happens when the
play<00:04:13.050> is<00:04:13.080> that<00:04:13.290> these<00:04:13.740> retract<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.360> water

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
play is that these retract and the water

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.479 
play is that these retract and the water
