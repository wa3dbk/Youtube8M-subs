over on the side of the road because I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.730 
over on the side of the road because I
want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:24.240> deep<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.630> puddle<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.820> oh

want to see how deep that puddle this oh
yeah<00:00:29.390> we'll<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> second<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
yeah we'll get to them in a second but I

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
yeah we'll get to them in a second but I
thought<00:00:34.710> I'd<00:00:35.100> show<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:37.079> crew<00:00:37.649> two's<00:00:38.329> well

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
thought I'd show off the crew two's well

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.860 
thought I'd show off the crew two's well
these<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> Metzler<00:00:41.910> kuru<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
these are actually the Metzler kuru to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.510 
these are actually the Metzler kuru to
tease<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.129> I'm<00:00:44.219> guessing<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> T<00:00:45.120> stands<00:00:45.660> for

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
tease and I'm guessing the T stands for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.100 
tease and I'm guessing the T stands for
traveller<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.989> at<00:00:48.989> least<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.890> does<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
traveller or at least I think it does I

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
traveller or at least I think it does I
think<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.379> read<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.739> their<00:00:52.890> website<00:00:53.100> not
