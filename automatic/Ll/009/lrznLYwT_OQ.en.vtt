now initially what we're going to do is
put<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> little<00:02:43.180> separation<00:02:43.810> between<00:02:44.140> these

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
put a little separation between these

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:56.160

two<00:02:44.500> notes<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:55.690> what<00:02:55.810> I'd<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:55.930> you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
two notes like so now what I'd like you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170

to<00:02:56.260> pay<00:02:56.409> special<00:02:56.440> attention<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
to pay special attention to is the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.330 
to pay special attention to is the
motion<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.659> the<00:02:58.750> arm<00:02:58.959> when<00:02:59.530> playing<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.159> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
middle third of the bow generally we use

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
middle third of the bow generally we use
more<00:03:03.040> elbow<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.209> shoulder<00:03:04.319> movement<00:03:05.319> to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
more elbow and shoulder movement to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.470 
more elbow and shoulder movement to
execute<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.430> from<00:03:06.610> one<00:03:06.849> string<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.269> another

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
execute going from one string to another

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.270 
execute going from one string to another
you<00:03:08.379> notice<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.860> variety<00:03:09.819> here<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.129> you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
you notice a variety here so that you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.710 
you notice a variety here so that you
can<00:03:15.370> imagine<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.060> go<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.420> say<00:03:16.569> for

change<00:03:20.859> is<00:03:21.010> even<00:03:21.160> more<00:03:21.489> dramatic<00:03:21.670> for<00:03:22.420> now

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
change is even more dramatic for now

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.270

we'll<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.989> stick<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.530> next<00:03:23.859> consecutive

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
we'll just stick to the next consecutive

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.039 
we'll just stick to the next consecutive
string<00:03:24.849> up<00:03:25.060> from<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.420> D<00:03:25.569> which<00:03:25.750> would<00:03:25.840> be<00:03:25.930> the

string up from the D which would be the
