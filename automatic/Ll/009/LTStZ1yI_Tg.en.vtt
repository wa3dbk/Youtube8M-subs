plenty<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.150> room<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:49.430> it's<00:03:49.550> about<00:03:49.700> fifty

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
plenty of room I think it's about fifty

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.160 
plenty of room I think it's about fifty
bucks<00:03:50.210> more<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.400> copper<00:03:52.400> spur<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:56.170> think

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
bucks more for the copper spur I think

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.110 
bucks more for the copper spur I think
it's<00:03:57.260> worth<00:03:57.500> it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
it's worth it

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.900 
it's worth it
think<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.270> out<00:03:59.360> here<00:03:59.660> real<00:03:59.840> quick<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:01.790> was

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
think it out here real quick it was

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.310 
think it out here real quick it was
probably<00:04:02.030> already<00:04:02.270> getting<00:04:02.600> too<00:04:02.780> long<00:04:02.930> and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
probably already getting too long and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.320 
probably already getting too long and
boring<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:06.250> for<00:04:07.250> those<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.460> you<00:04:07.670> who<00:04:08.030> like<00:04:08.300> me

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.940 
boring so for those of you who like me
been<00:04:08.780> trying<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.140> decide<00:04:09.470> between<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.920> two

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
been trying to decide between the two

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.860 
been trying to decide between the two
maybe<00:04:10.610> this<00:04:10.850> might<00:04:11.060> give<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.450> little<00:04:11.750> bit

maybe this might give you a little bit
of<00:04:11.990> help<00:04:13.150> sing<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.450> side<00:04:15.080> by<00:04:15.230> side<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.910> think

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
of help sing to side by side and I think

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.080
