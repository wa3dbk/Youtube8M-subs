00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
with finding matrix here we decided to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.460 
with finding matrix here we decided to

for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> glove<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.280> went<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.270> crit<00:02:33.570> damage

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
armor role as well not it's okay we had

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.470 
armor role as well not it's okay we had
a<00:03:13.230> long<00:03:14.100> discussion<00:03:14.250> about<00:03:14.670> which<00:03:15.000> glove<00:03:15.300> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
a long discussion about which glove to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.260 
a long discussion about which glove to
pick<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.980> feel<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.150> going

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
pick and I feel with this one it's going

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.970 
pick and I feel with this one it's going
to<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.450> pretty<00:03:18.810> hard<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> upgrade<00:03:19.500> DPS<00:03:20.040> wise

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
to be pretty hard to upgrade DPS wise

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.660 
to be pretty hard to upgrade DPS wise
and<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.020> would<00:03:25.170> add<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.530> are<00:03:25.860> all

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and I think if you would add a are all

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
and I think if you would add a are all
resistance<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.270> this<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.660> would<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.900> easily

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
resistance to this it would be easily

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.880 
resistance to this it would be easily
500<00:03:29.070> million<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:31.110> glove<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.410> probably

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
500 million so this glove is probably

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.580 
500 million so this glove is probably
here<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.160> stay<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.610> while<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:34.170> our<00:03:34.380> last

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
here to stay for a while and our last

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.440 
here to stay for a while and our last
piece<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.490> like<00:03:35.880> who<00:03:36.060> needs<00:03:36.120> we

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
piece is going to be like who needs we

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.750 
piece is going to be like who needs we
got<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.780> go<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.080> who<00:03:37.230> needs<00:03:37.260> here<00:03:37.800> just

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
got to go like who needs here just

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.940 
got to go like who needs here just
because<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.090> didn't<00:03:39.360> get<00:03:39.510> all<00:03:39.780> resist<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.650> mean

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
because we didn't get all resist I mean

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.290 
because we didn't get all resist I mean
it<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.100> because<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.550> didn't<00:03:41.760> get<00:03:41.880> attack

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
it just because we didn't get attack

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.720 
it just because we didn't get attack
speed<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.050> amulet<00:03:43.500> we're<00:03:44.220> gonna<00:03:44.310> get<00:03:44.520> we

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
speed on the amulet we're gonna get we

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.730 
speed on the amulet we're gonna get we
have<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> 9<00:03:45.390> attack<00:03:45.990> speed<00:03:46.110> la·cu<00:03:46.530> knees

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
have to get a 9 attack speed la·cu knees

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.980 
have to get a 9 attack speed la·cu knees
so<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:47.910> one<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.180> picked<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.420> little<00:03:48.690> bit<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.900> it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
so this one we picked a little bit of it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.680 
so this one we picked a little bit of it
already<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.800> five<00:03:50.520> per<00:03:50.730> chance<00:03:51.000> need<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.510> crit

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
already is five per chance need the crit

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.000 
already is five per chance need the crit
chance<00:03:51.720> here<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.860> 100<00:03:53.550> million<00:03:53.880> buyout<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.890> was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
chance here a 100 million buyout it was

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.470 
chance here a 100 million buyout it was
the<00:03:56.100> best<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.460> in<00:03:56.610> its<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:57.150> its<00:03:57.900> range<00:03:59.480> not

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
the best one in its in its range not

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.530 
the best one in its in its range not
overly<00:04:00.840> great<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.830> it's<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:02.430> bad<00:04:02.730> extra

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
overly great but it's not bad extra

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.480 
overly great but it's not bad extra
regen<00:04:03.900> life<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.180> all<00:04:06.300> ended<00:04:06.690> up<00:04:06.780> being

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
regen life so all in all ended up being

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.030 
regen life so all in all ended up being
954<00:04:08.490> million<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:12.350> yeah<00:04:13.350> about<00:04:13.620> nine<00:04:13.830> hundred

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
954 million and yeah about nine hundred

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.930 
954 million and yeah about nine hundred
fifty<00:04:14.490> four<00:04:14.640> million<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.350> again<00:04:17.220> we<00:04:17.430> hid<00:04:17.640> under

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
fifty four million so again we hid under

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.039 
fifty four million so again we hid under
budget<00:04:18.410> we<00:04:19.410> got<00:04:19.880> three<00:04:20.880> gems<00:04:21.180> here<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:21.690> even
