before<00:02:11.180> she<00:02:11.540> started<00:02:11.900> painting<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.440> back<00:02:12.620> on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
before she started painting them back on

before she started painting them back on
the<00:02:13.849> old<00:02:14.000> photograph<00:02:14.480> she<00:02:14.660> was<00:02:14.810> working<00:02:15.170> with

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
the old photograph she was working with

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.870 
the old photograph she was working with
showed<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.709> they<00:02:15.800> were<00:02:15.830> spaced<00:02:16.280> together<00:02:16.670> in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
showed that they were spaced together in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.740 
showed that they were spaced together in
an<00:02:17.030> unusual<00:02:17.660> way<00:02:17.830> wasn't<00:02:18.830> very<00:02:19.069> artistic<00:02:19.910> but

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
an unusual way wasn't very artistic but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.940 
an unusual way wasn't very artistic but
they<00:02:20.840> sure<00:02:21.050> didn't<00:02:21.290> look<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.590> any<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
they sure didn't look like any of the

they sure didn't look like any of the
constellations<00:02:22.730> she<00:02:22.910> was<00:02:23.060> familiar<00:02:23.240> with

constellations she was familiar with

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
constellations she was familiar with
Margaret<00:02:24.950> needed<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.280> star<00:02:25.580> expert<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.110> she

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
Margaret needed a star expert so she

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.510 
Margaret needed a star expert so she
took<00:02:27.380> her<00:02:27.500> photographs<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> st.<00:02:28.370> Mary's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
took her photographs to st. Mary's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.970 
took her photographs to st. Mary's
University<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.989> office<00:02:30.319> of<00:02:30.440> astronomer

David Turner he too didn't see anything

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.240 
David Turner he too didn't see anything
familiar<00:02:34.310> at<00:02:35.030> first<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.590> horribly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
familiar at first it's just a horribly

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.089 
familiar at first it's just a horribly
bland<00:02:37.640> star<00:02:38.239> scene<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.590> imagine<00:02:39.739> this

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
bland star scene and I can imagine this

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.350 
bland star scene and I can imagine this
just<00:02:40.370> someone<00:02:40.640> looking<00:02:40.910> at<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.180> thinking

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
just someone looking at it and thinking

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.150 
just someone looking at it and thinking
that<00:02:41.660> there's<00:02:41.870> nothing<00:02:42.050> here<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.440> see<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.950> just

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
that there's nothing here to see it just

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.309 
that there's nothing here to see it just
looks<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.610> someone's<00:02:44.060> thrown<00:02:44.420> stars<00:02:45.080> up

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
looks like someone's thrown stars up

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.949 
looks like someone's thrown stars up
there<00:02:45.349> at<00:02:45.860> random<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.030> then<00:02:47.180> he<00:02:47.390> got<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.569> closer

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
there at random but then he got a closer

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.479 
there at random but then he got a closer
look<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> thought<00:02:48.709> he<00:02:48.830> saw<00:02:49.010> something

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
look and thought he saw something

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.390 
look and thought he saw something
familiar<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:50.660> took<00:02:50.840> me<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.020> while<00:02:51.230> before<00:02:51.470> I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
familiar it took me a while before I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.550 
familiar it took me a while before I
I<00:02:52.430> spotted<00:02:53.120> what<00:02:53.629> looked<00:02:53.810> like<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.020> clump<00:02:54.140> of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I spotted what looked like a clump of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.740 
I spotted what looked like a clump of
stars<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.190> turned<00:02:55.430> out<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.610> be<00:02:55.760> Perseus<00:02:56.420> and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
stars that turned out to be Perseus and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
but the parts of Perseus shone on the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.369 
but the parts of Perseus shone on the
ceiling<00:03:01.849> were<00:03:02.270> some<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.599> most<00:03:02.750> obscure

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
ceiling were some of the most obscure

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
stars in that part of the sky why David

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.800 
stars in that part of the sky why David
Turner<00:03:07.100> wondered<00:03:07.550> when<00:03:08.090> anyone<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.570> chosen

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810

Turner wondered when anyone have chosen
such<00:03:09.110> an<00:03:09.230> odd<00:03:09.440> collection<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.190> stars<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.730> pay

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
such an odd collection of stars to pay

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
in such an important church I had some

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.580 
in such an important church I had some
things<00:03:13.910> in<00:03:14.060> mind<00:03:14.240> why<00:03:14.510> Perseus<00:03:15.110> why<00:03:15.290> was

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
things in mind why Perseus why was

Lunenburg would have looked like in a
much<00:03:36.200> more<00:03:36.440> distant<00:03:37.100> time<00:03:37.310> twenty-fifth<00:03:38.440> it

was<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:39.830> he<00:03:40.130> finally<00:03:40.850> saw<00:03:41.210> what<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.570> Stars

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
was then he finally saw what the Stars

without the discovery of their meaning

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.890 
without the discovery of their meaning
we<00:04:54.680> had<00:04:54.980> photographs<00:04:55.970> of<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.450> dome<00:04:56.630> ceiling

we had photographs of the dome ceiling

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.810 
we had photographs of the dome ceiling
and<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.770> placement<00:04:58.190> of<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.310> stars<00:04:58.580> but

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
and the placement of the stars but

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.520 
and the placement of the stars but
they're<00:04:59.000> not<00:04:59.120> complete<00:04:59.570> there<00:05:00.080> are<00:05:00.200> certain

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
shadows covers some of the stars so we

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.230 
shadows covers some of the stars so we

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
section of the ceiling and we will have

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.180 
section of the ceiling and we will have
