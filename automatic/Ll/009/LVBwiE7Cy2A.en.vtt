00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.370 
things to experience inside the
rainforest<00:01:48.270> each<00:01:48.689> Zoo<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.290> bit

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
rainforest each Zoo is a little bit

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.209 
rainforest each Zoo is a little bit
different<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> don't<00:01:50.040> want<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
different so you don't want to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.980 
different so you don't want to
generalize<00:01:50.579> there's<00:01:51.090> some<00:01:51.329> zoos<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.899> our

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
generalize there's some zoos at our

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
generalize there's some zoos at our
destination<00:01:52.200> places<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.430> just

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
destination places that there are just

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.660 
destination places that there are just
so<00:01:53.820> big<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.329> spend

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
so big you can spend

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.310 
so big you can spend
a couple<00:01:55.360> days<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.720> probably<00:01:56.020> missed<00:01:56.200> some

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
a couple days and probably missed some

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.140 
a couple days and probably missed some
missed<00:01:56.560> some<00:01:56.680> things<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> way<00:01:58.119> that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
missed some things this is a way that

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.580 
missed some things this is a way that
you<00:01:58.390> can<00:01:58.509> see<00:01:58.659> things<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.229> was<00:01:59.350> fairly

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
you can see things and it was fairly

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.050 
you can see things and it was fairly
short<00:01:59.979> amount<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.220> time<00:02:00.280> frame<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:00.820> as<00:02:00.939> you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
short amount of time frame but as you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.399 
short amount of time frame but as you
can<00:02:01.150> see<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.570> line<00:02:01.720> behind<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.200> here

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
can see with the line behind you here

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.530 
can see with the line behind you here
we're<00:02:02.890> roughly<00:02:03.130> up<00:02:03.369> close<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.820> them<00:02:03.909> there's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
we're roughly up close to them there's

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.700 
we're roughly up close to them there's
some<00:02:04.750> exhibits<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.439> don't<00:02:05.560> get<00:02:05.649> that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
some exhibits we just don't get that

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.410 
some exhibits we just don't get that
interaction<00:02:06.100> with<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.700> with<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.180> given

a<00:02:16.360> big<00:02:16.660> part<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> mission<00:02:17.410> here<00:02:17.860> at<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
a big part of the mission here at the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.250 
a big part of the mission here at the
Buffalo<00:02:18.520> zoo<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.569> than<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.930> seeing

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
Buffalo zoo it's more than just seeing

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.110 
Buffalo zoo it's more than just seeing
animals<00:02:20.650> someone<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.130> conservation<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:21.970> kind

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
animals someone but conservation is kind

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.670 
animals someone but conservation is kind
of<00:02:22.150> our<00:02:22.300> underlying<00:02:22.660> mission<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.140> everything

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
of our underlying mission so everything

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.130 
of our underlying mission so everything
sort<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.730> feeds<00:02:24.940> into<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.300> smart<00:02:25.599> resources

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
sort of feeds into that smart resources

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750 
sort of feeds into that smart resources
were<00:02:26.260> recycling<00:02:26.890> him<00:02:27.040> every<00:02:27.310> respect<00:02:27.670> you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
were recycling him every respect you

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.130 
were recycling him every respect you
don't<00:02:27.910> go<00:02:27.970> too<00:02:28.150> far<00:02:28.300> without<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.600> reminder<00:02:29.019> of

don't go too far without a reminder of

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.009 
don't go too far without a reminder of
that<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:30.459> footprint<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
that that your footprint is is a

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.360 
that that your footprint is is a
permanent<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.890> got<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.190> what<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
permanent one and you got to do what you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.729 
permanent one and you got to do what you
can<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.549> reduce<00:02:33.790> its<00:02:34.750> impression<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.650> we

straws at the concession stand I've made
out<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.650> paper<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.069> they're<00:02:39.220> biodegradable

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
out of paper so they're biodegradable

out of paper so they're biodegradable
part<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> money<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.230> pay<00:02:41.410> when<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.860> park
