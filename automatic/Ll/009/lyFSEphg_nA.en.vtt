00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 run let's call them yes yes yes guys so how 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.930
 always of course of course 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 communicate in our VKontakte group 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.410
 look like a cafe and shall well remember 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 about the site you look out there is no golik 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.820
 official portal wargaming.net leagues and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.420
 Generally all masters but also maps 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.660
 ruinberg 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.119
 Himmelsdorf cliff and mines like this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310
 order to them here now may be something 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 tell the wheels yes well the first card mts 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
 This is most likely a little dynamics 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 a little bit of aggression from both sides so 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 as usual the first map ruinberg yes not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.260
 teams to look after each other 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 here ruinberg map was chosen second 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 maybe on the second card there will be some 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.890
 first moment possible df attack possible 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.989
 but again the first card is a reason Ensk 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 This tactic was chosen, I think 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.539
 here either lfs or bfg depending on 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 the one who chose the respawn loot will 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.690
 nothing to do yes yes no I did 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.989
 I assume that really some 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.090
 dynamic disassembly well, good luck to us 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.550
 all on ensk again, nothing new 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 350,100 for 2 is a third for two t1 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.489
 cunningham 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.309
 Well Well weave bfg moto moto firm words 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.229
 of and third is love machine and mask two 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 p1 max max and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 symbiot team lfs weave slave syrup 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.119
 annihilator armageddon 08 23 people want 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.490
 two t1 ren order is all guard today 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.189
 play without Armagedon 07 he also has 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170
 team roster but in blue 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.729
 bfg team color is very yellow 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 color lookin 'for sponsor both teams 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.920
 go to the railway we wanted 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 to see a night fight here, but here's how 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.189
 recently here look here what i said 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 most likely one of the teams is just 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.000
 assumed she would do an opponent 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.860
 Would you guess the points if bfg 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.689
 let's see what of course guys think of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.500
 but then it seems to me anyway Ensk 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.390
 Kamaz must calmly pass 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.310
 yes they go up and watch it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 And very well flew on 402 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.149
 damage and apparently chat is wide 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.829
 drive around now lfs maybe here 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.079
 there will be a fight well and bfg is also not in place 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.060
 stand go on the attack though remember how 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.030
 we wrote dragons now we understand how 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 play in the gold series 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.479
 this bf greyly is not wright also moto moto 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.670
 because once again gets something 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.290
 armageddon bad locator 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.849
 exchange of shells, you can pick up 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.789
 but here is a small shelter 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.620
 mound plus small 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.370
 don't let the womb survive but he 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.769
 get from isa the third is trivial for 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 faces 3 i don't know which alpha should be 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.250
 so that he is not taken away by the blind 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.989
 someone i saw should be possible now 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.640
 we'll see how easy it is to take a review 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.560
 both but again it is a little bit in the low to 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.010
 there I am a homo small lets him 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.170
 to hide 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.060
 Well, although you know here now was not 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.250
 mound on shoot how much hut it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
 spa salon go maslov gets right now 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.900
 lost a little bit bfg need to somehow 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.780
 more confident more confident attack further 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.019
 or to leave but do not be let's focus 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.569
 opposition to teams looking at the 0-lu 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.150
 the sponsor there are two strands still in 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.030
 ambush and that's exactly possible from them 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.980
 something will depend on the apple gets from 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.959
 Isa the third is another shot bfg 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.079
 align hp very dynamically 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.659
 It begins Ensk card is very brazen and 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:07.159
 act very happy bfg comes 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.720
 I would start watching the whole because too 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.579
 about him came out just did not forget the bottom 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.650
 that they were also beaten for passion 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.049
 originally played at the bottom base and this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.269
 protective traveling in very rare teams 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.269
 attack from the bottom base leaving in Zelenka 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.459
 this and here you can click in fact 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.530
 need to try but if such information 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.019
 only generally here in principle theoretically 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.449
 they may suspect that someone is here 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.069
 stayed though no city control no you 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.780
 first now I'm moving there too 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.019
 see ren order is all guard they 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.909
 already passes well firstly on exploration in 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.769
 second on the layout of the so-called and they 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.069
 may be a bit later in the circle 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.319
 and 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.609
 and will go to the seizure but you look 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.870
 gets up a lot maybe it will 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.220
 just hard backlight minus 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.319
 some motu motu 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.940
 and then there will be bfg problems too 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.620
 a little bit now given space 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.750
 lfs which seems to be squeezed in green 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.120
 but in fact not quite squeezed and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.859
 in principle there can be a counterattack 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.659
 only agree that then I have there 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.799
 just unreal lumbago through the pipe 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.030
 mask is trying to pick up their opponents 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.379
 ok its purpose is it millimeter in 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.680
 millimeter is not a very important point 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.019
 level improve and he 3 2t 1l guard 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.840
 grenadier will decide a lot for the team 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.720
 but they will decide then when the opponent himself 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.789
 go ahead here this one should be here 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.680
 here here is maslovo and moto moto only 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.150
 a little bit 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.979
 grace play you first he will give such 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.139
 just need to eat according to the idea in render a 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.120
 survive here or not see no one 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.340
 shoots poisoning that there is no here with 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.509
 vision as well as the observer training 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.310
 the room is hard for us now 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.990
 comment we of course our 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.610
 the lake will figure out how to return the old 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.900
 version so that you can see the moment of light 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.130
 because we still suspect that 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.770
 Do we comment anything on the lan-final 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.340
 do not attack at all look out 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.009
 the house where the love machine was located 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.169
 it is possible maslov here the question from zero 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.880
 by if it is not taken away if they answer 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.889
 everything will be fine but here armageddon 08 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.960
 may ask for a good position bfg true 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.669
 here they are to you french annihilator by 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.720
 the first line is f 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.630
 rear can go ferre 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.120
 review on concrete vanadotny can be extinguished 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.310
 it and take Armageddon in vain climbed 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.960
 here the truth is the pirate is not delayed 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.090
 capture base to love and yet will 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.639
 watch 231 slips under the embankment 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.669
 for the circle neatly call in 1 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.199
 capture shoot down anyone and 2 in the capture of both 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.580
 works well for olaf across the west 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.099
 bases so far here is a very important decision 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.660
 don't strangle now wanga eppl need 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.669
 return for opponents liotar and shoot down 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.970
 seizure then most 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.280
 and take liotar. Comrade slave 40 wkd this 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.530
 saw the whole team lfs what he left for 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.229
 recharge and then in principle there is time 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.050
 -31 not happy point took defat anyone 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.210
 took away for sleep nobody it must be 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.840
 victory annihilator main pick 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.520
 pheromone following the example of faith rkd 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.229
 roverbook minus fer nitrogen hammer 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.970
 last opportunity annihilator 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.650
 gets shot through double fence 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.810
 I wanted to break through and three time enough 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.919
 go through the train also give a say 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:00.099
 may not be enough let's watch guys 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:03.250
 drive pulls a simulator you can drive whose 1 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:05.830
 you can grab that vine can captured 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.570
 This is a victory lfs first battle is not necessary 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.580
 was coming down now moto moto 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.560
 fiction survives two tanks one 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.380
 vanshot live and again they take a round 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.500
 capture on ensk good start of the match 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.990
 he would give later or earlier everything could 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.220
 happen quite differently in seconds 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.930
 split second before bum and 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.699
 it is possible to leave wearing earlier 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.229
 a second and a half seconds before everything 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.880
 you manage to knock it down from one barrel 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.620
 the second took the refunds once somewhere 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.490
 stopped and all of it is just here 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.160
 literally a mistake there 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.039
 seconds of reaction when the captain said 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.490
 come back to the lfs base of course should 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.110
 get a medal for what character on 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.729
 in fact this is a lesson for bfg not all 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.580
 did the right thing not cool worked 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.770
 the whole round they gave a lot of damage but 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.990
 look it was the beginning of goodness forgotten 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.669
 about capture they killed weave it all seemed 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.889
 cool and seemed weaving time 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.229
 shoot down the slightest mistake just an error 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.979
 bfg team is that they have begun 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.080
 went on the attack 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.569
 seems to have clung to the alteration began 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.819
 win and then they gave the opportunity 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.919
 Opponent to recoup given the opportunity 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.380
 rival pull a couple of tanks to capture 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:13.400
 bases that could not be done 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.710
 here all their dirty races without hesitation 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.870
 yes here here it is purely necessary to look at 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.419
 performance indicator capture vt1 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.120
 teams lfs solgar two t1 simulator 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:25.159
 decided to round generally further here all
