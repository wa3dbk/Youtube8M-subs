00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.290
 hello all my name is john drill this thing well let's see quickly 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.980
 how to connect our website it talks to the google service 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.179
 analytics 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.159
 to be prepared a website 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:15.409
 what is called real estate trujillo point report in which he has made a 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.869
 installation the cicad it talks to the example data 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.990
 assuming this is our final website 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.490
 what remains now will be to connect it with 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.429
 the google analytics service 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.640
 well thought out abulia analytics and it will be necessary to have an account associated with 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 bublé yav analytics in this case and use an account that I already have created 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 and just do not enter the account 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 let's see the following 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 as if you already know the key 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.190
 once we have entered the account 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 but for this account in specific idea I have the associated with a website 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.050
 then we will add a new site profile 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's add some site profiles copy here the address of the site 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.190
 web that I wish 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.460
 percent and the other data are correct let's put final 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 well at the end julienne been testing a code 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.400
 this code agrees on the following for a single domain 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240
 will occupy some domain with several expo domain for several domains of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.660
 Upper level 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.510
 we go beyond the simple things and we're going to do what this code 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.110
 work only for one domain 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.720
 let's copy this code then 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.590
 we copy 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.560
 i what google suggests 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.530
 He explained that the code 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.840
 before the hit and what is the closing of labeling headers 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.450
 before them 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.920
 this suggestion was before him 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 the civilization of the body is of the label made in the loop currently 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.120
 compared to keeping all the statistics correctly 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.500
 especially the edil variable bounce percentage bounce 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.440
 the one that is now happening where it is placed in the header 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.380
 then we will be quickly to this 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.600
 on our site 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.269
 in intermediate 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.239
 the installation of it speaks of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.370
 inside the cell files in the folder temp laws 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:21.869
 I'm going to enter the dog temple exit and goya enter the temple that I'm 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:26.269
 currently using in this case for my website in the vrae I'm not 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.539
 thinking about the temple and delvis 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.319
 I will enter avis 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.649
 and in the file invex php point 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 I'm going to avoid this file 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.329
 and I'm going to claim the code that is google suggests to me to adhere and that I do 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.540
 before the near hectares label right here 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.509
 we were the code 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.509
 we store the file 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.809
 and I think the file is stored 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.279
 we went nothing called me green 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.279
 and we can get fat and it ends 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.650
 once we have that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.719
 in irc there would be something 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.870
 domenicali that is not 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.719
 receiving the data 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.719
 we are going to avoid this website here 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.569
 and let's go to check the status check state 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:22.469
 is tested in order that i 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.999
 9 in which the data would be received, which includes the fact that 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.819
 private the code that in the suggested 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.819
 and here it leaves waiting for data 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.119
 says google analytics installed correctly and is now waiting 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.839
 collect the data 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.219
 then it is already correctly associated 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.579
 bublé with on my website 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.579
 let's go to the home page 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.019
 and let's see what just now state and the icon waiting for data not 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.230
 once the probe in two passed in 24 hours 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.890
 let's see the statistics as I'll show you next with this 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.279
 another website 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.039
 in omán to the show a series of very interesting parameters bubok 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.329
 time spent on the site number of visits and so on 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.040
 well it is an approximation for 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.290
 you can associate v analytics with our website 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.479
 another option would be to get some extension that allows me to do that 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.669
 work 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.009
 but in fact I do not know what site besides new ones will only get and my 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.690
 website would be more practical maybe place the code directly such 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.340
 as he explained 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.690
 that's all for now thanks for the visit
