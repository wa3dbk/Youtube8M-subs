who<00:02:22.350> came<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.610> was<00:02:23.790> interesting<00:02:24.240> because

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
who came in it was interesting because

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.080 
who came in it was interesting because

steam<00:02:45.630> jacketed<00:02:46.200> container<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.040> use<00:02:47.280> for

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
steam jacketed container that we use for

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.070 
steam jacketed container that we use for
cooking<00:02:48.360> our<00:02:48.690> mash<00:02:49.250> we're<00:02:50.250> able<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:51.080> pump

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
cooking our mash we're able to pump

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.660 
cooking our mash we're able to pump
through<00:02:52.350> steam<00:02:52.890> through<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.610> very

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
through steam through here it's very

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.620 
through steam through here it's very
efficient<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.450> heat<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> mash<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:57.390> bring

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
efficient and heat the mash up we bring

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.020 
efficient and heat the mash up we bring
it<00:02:57.720> up<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> temperature<00:02:58.470> keep<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> there<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
it up the temperature keep it there and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490 
it up the temperature keep it there and
then<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.660> want<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.960> bring<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.260> back<00:03:01.440> down

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
then when we want to bring it back down

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.470 
then when we want to bring it back down
and<00:03:01.920> temperature<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.490> can<00:03:02.520> change<00:03:02.910> from<00:03:03.210> steam

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
and temperature we can change from steam

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780 
and temperature we can change from steam
to<00:03:03.750> cooling<00:03:03.990> water<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.370> drop<00:03:05.610> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
to cooling water so we can drop the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.180 
to cooling water so we can drop the
temperature<00:03:06.240> down<00:03:06.440> relatively<00:03:07.440> quickly<00:03:07.800> so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
temperature down relatively quickly so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.479 
temperature down relatively quickly so
that<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.660> add<00:03:09.780> our<00:03:09.810> malt<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:10.709> pitch

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
that we can add our malt and then pitch

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.310 
that we can add our malt and then pitch
the<00:03:11.760> yeast<00:03:11.790> bring<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> pitching

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the yeast bring it to pitching

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.860 
the yeast bring it to pitching
temperature<00:03:13.830> then<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.580> go<00:03:14.760> over<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.060> we're

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
temperature then we go over and we're

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.920 
temperature then we go over and we're
using<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.920> same<00:03:17.130> tank<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:18.180> fermentation

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
using the the same tank for fermentation

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.130 
using the the same tank for fermentation
tanks<00:03:19.380> they're<00:03:20.310> 550<00:03:21.090> gallon<00:03:21.420> tanks<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:21.930> do

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
tanks they're 550 gallon tanks we do

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.270 
tanks they're 550 gallon tanks we do
about<00:03:22.380> generally<00:03:23.160> about<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.370> 450<00:03:24.239> gallon<00:03:24.630> mash

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
about generally about a 450 gallon mash

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.470 
about generally about a 450 gallon mash
so<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.270> usually<00:03:27.660> this<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> three-day

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
so this is usually this is a three-day

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
so this is usually this is a three-day
fermentation<00:03:30.480> over<00:03:30.690> here<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.920> comes

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
fermentation over here then it comes

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.220 
fermentation over here then it comes
pumped<00:03:33.360> back<00:03:33.720> over<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:35.270> this<00:03:36.270> we<00:03:36.840> did<00:03:37.020> make<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
pumped back over here this we did make a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.010 
pumped back over here this we did make a
few<00:03:37.470> minor<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.160> added<00:03:38.520> patience<00:03:39.150> close<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.930> up

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
few minor and added patience close it up

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.460 
few minor and added patience close it up
and<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.830> has<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.270> copper<00:03:42.270> pipe<00:03:42.900> here<00:03:43.260> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and this has a copper pipe here that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.360 
and this has a copper pipe here that
acts<00:03:43.680> as<00:03:43.950> our<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:45.600> axes<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.110> still<00:03:46.500> we

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
acts as our and this axes are still we

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.729 
acts as our and this axes are still we
come<00:03:47.610> up<00:03:47.790> come<00:03:48.090> across<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.630> gooseneck<00:03:48.810> there

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
come up come across the gooseneck there

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.070 
come up come across the gooseneck there
is<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> another<00:03:50.790> condensing<00:03:51.450> coil<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.930> this

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
is a another condensing coil in this

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.229 
is a another condensing coil in this
water<00:03:52.350> tank<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.370> steam<00:03:53.700> comes<00:03:54.000> up

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
water tank so the steam comes up

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.080 
water tank so the steam comes up
condenses<00:03:55.140> through<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.530> coil<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.730> we

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
condenses through the coil and we

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.680 
condenses through the coil and we
collect<00:03:57.540> our<00:03:57.690> low<00:03:57.900> wine<00:03:58.170> right<00:03:58.470> down<00:03:58.709> here<00:03:59.690> so

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
collect our low wine right down here so

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.020 
collect our low wine right down here so
the<00:04:01.230> coil<00:04:01.530> then<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:02.040> actually<00:04:02.220> preheating<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the coil then is actually preheating the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.449 
the coil then is actually preheating the
water<00:04:03.360> for<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.870> next<00:04:04.140> batch<00:04:04.380> when<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.830> cook<00:04:05.070> so

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
water for the next batch when we cook so

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.259 
water for the next batch when we cook so
we<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> lot<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.530> energy<00:04:07.530> savings<00:04:07.980> there<00:04:08.340> we

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
we get a lot of energy savings there we

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.800 
we get a lot of energy savings there we
take<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> low<00:04:10.860> whine<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.610> then<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.630> goes

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
take the low whine and then it goes

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.810 
take the low whine and then it goes
actually<00:04:13.080> through<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.590> pot<00:04:13.830> still<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.430> all<00:04:14.640> of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
actually through the pot still so all of

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.030 
actually through the pot still so all of
our<00:04:14.910> whiskey's<00:04:15.390> are

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
our whiskey's are

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.310 
our whiskey's are
well<00:04:17.130> distilled<00:04:17.490> and<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.600> pot<00:04:18.780> still<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.290> a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
well distilled and the pot still is a

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.780 
well distilled and the pot still is a
link<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.770> family's<00:04:20.220> distilling

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
link to the family's distilling

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
link to the family's distilling
traditions<00:04:21.330> as<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.450> very<00:04:24.450> basic

matures and trying to figure out the
life<00:06:18.090> form<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:18.480> it's<00:06:18.630> taking<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.350> we<00:06:20.130> we<00:06:20.820> hope

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
life form that it's taking so we we hope

life form that it's taking so we we hope
and<00:06:21.210> expect<00:06:21.600> that<00:06:21.720> in<00:06:22.500> a<00:06:22.560> couple<00:06:22.860> more<00:06:23.010> years

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
and expect that in a couple more years

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.140 
and expect that in a couple more years
that'll<00:06:23.610> be<00:06:23.850> ready

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
that'll be ready

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.510 
that'll be ready
eventually<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:25.290> willit<00:06:25.560> spirit<00:06:26.010> may<00:06:26.160> replace
