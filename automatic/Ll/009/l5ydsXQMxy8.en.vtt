00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
two minutes it is still a little bit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.080 
two minutes it is still a little bit
different<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.739> yeah<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.339> shorter

straight<00:02:22.849> final<00:02:23.709> sprint<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.450> or<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.590> a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
straight final sprint and or to do a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.240 
straight final sprint and or to do a
move<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.329> on<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.660> last<00:02:30.109> lap<00:02:30.410> somewhere

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
move on the on the last lap somewhere

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.170 
move on the on the last lap somewhere
and<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:33.049> like<00:02:33.290> no<00:02:33.980> clamps<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:34.910> anything

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180
