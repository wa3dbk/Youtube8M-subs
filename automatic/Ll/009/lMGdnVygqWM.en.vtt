here's<00:00:01.469> another<00:00:01.800> attempt<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.820> making<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.210> video

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
here's another attempt at making a video

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.840 
here's another attempt at making a video
about<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.750> minecart<00:00:04.200> station<00:00:04.259> oh<00:00:04.650> boy<00:00:04.890> more

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
about a minecart station oh boy more

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.740 
about a minecart station oh boy more
minecart<00:00:06.270> station

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
minecart station

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.120 
minecart station
we're<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.880> a<00:00:08.880> multiplayer<00:00:09.630> server<00:00:10.130> not

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we're here on a multiplayer server not

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620 
we're here on a multiplayer server not
me<00:00:11.250> people<00:00:11.490> online<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> fairly

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
me people online but it's the fairly

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.120 
me people online but it's the fairly
cheap<00:00:12.840> post<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.380> things<00:00:13.620> are<00:00:13.740> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> slow

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
cheap post so things are kind of slow

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.420 
cheap post so things are kind of slow
and<00:00:14.519> laggy<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.770> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> minecart<00:00:17.279> station

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and laggy so this is a minecart station

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.269 
and laggy so this is a minecart station
this<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> surface<00:00:18.480> portion<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.949> goal

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
this is the surface portion the goal

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.509 
this is the surface portion the goal
here<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> build<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.210> station<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
here is to build a station that is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.620 
here is to build a station that is
functional<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.580> multiplayer<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.420> be

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
functional and multiplayer and can be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
functional and multiplayer and can be
reliable<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.410> multiplayer<00:00:25.800> there's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
reliable in multiplayer there's a lot of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.279 
reliable in multiplayer there's a lot of
bugs<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.480> things<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.840> work<00:00:27.990> too<00:00:28.140> well

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bugs that make things not work too well

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
bugs that make things not work too well
and<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.980> hopefully<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> station<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.820> survive

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and so hopefully the station can survive

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.060 
and so hopefully the station can survive
all<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> those<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.439> needs<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.830> able<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
all of those it needs to be able to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.740 
all of those it needs to be able to
handle<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> high<00:00:32.700> traffic<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
handle a high traffic so if you have a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.270 
handle a high traffic so if you have a
lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.110> players<00:00:34.320> coming<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
lot of players coming and going that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.740 
lot of players coming and going that
they<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.670> use<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> station

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they can all use the station

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360 
they can all use the station
simultaneously<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> I'll<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> bunch<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
simultaneously and I'll go to a bunch of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430 
simultaneously and I'll go to a bunch of
different<00:00:38.489> destinations<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> hub

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
different destinations if it's the hub

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560 
different destinations if it's the hub
for<00:00:40.680> transit<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.790> needs<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.210> easy<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
for transit it needs to be easy to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.709 
for transit it needs to be easy to
maintain<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.290> hard<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> break<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
maintain and hard to break so that it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
maintain and hard to break so that it
can<00:00:45.989> survive<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.829> having<00:00:47.160> lots<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.370> people

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
can survive with having lots of people

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889 
can survive with having lots of people
use<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> constantly<00:00:48.480> be

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
use it you don't have to constantly be

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
use it you don't have to constantly be
going<00:00:49.020> back<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> fix<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
going back to fix it and we want it to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.729 
going back to fix it and we want it to
be<00:00:51.270> small<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.079> fit<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> building

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739

part that you want we just built it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.609 
part that you want we just built it
because<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> fits<00:01:06.869> our<00:01:07.110> building<00:01:07.380> designs

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so this minecart station is built for

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
so this minecart station is built for
eight<00:01:14.159> destination<00:01:14.820> where<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.020> any

eight destination where you can go any
of<00:01:16.619> any<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> eight<00:01:17.430> direction<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.930> has<00:01:19.049> for

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
of any of eight direction and it has for

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
of any of eight direction and it has for
departure<00:01:19.799> terminals<00:01:20.250> each<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
departure terminals each of which is

independently connected to all each of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
independently connected to all each of
the<00:01:23.159> eight<00:01:23.280> destinations<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.930> have

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the eight destinations so you can have

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
the eight destinations so you can have
four<00:01:25.290> people<00:01:25.530> come<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> simultaneously<00:01:26.520> pick

four people come and simultaneously pick

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
four people come and simultaneously pick
a<00:01:26.880> different<00:01:27.000> destination<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.990> four

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a different destination and go in four

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
a different destination and go in four
different<00:01:28.409> directions<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> works<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
different directions the way it works is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
different directions the way it works is
you<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.600> click<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> destination<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.890> pick

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you just click on a destination to pick

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.210 
you just click on a destination to pick

oh good bug this time so one of the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.199 
oh good bug this time so one of the
things<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.860> hardest<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.910> in

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
things that's hardest to do in

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.110 
things that's hardest to do in
multiplayer<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.679> an<00:02:10.890> unoccupied<00:02:11.550> car

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
multiplayer is to get an unoccupied car

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.699 
multiplayer is to get an unoccupied car
it<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.480> boost<00:02:12.629> an<00:02:12.780> occupied<00:02:13.200> car

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
it to boost an occupied car

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.369 
it to boost an occupied car
that's<00:02:14.150> why<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.390> station<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.959> built<00:02:16.109> to

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
that's why this station is built to

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.039 
that's why this station is built to
reset<00:02:17.189> you<00:02:17.340> automatically<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.959> get

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
reset you automatically if you don't get

reset you automatically if you don't get
a<00:02:19.109> good<00:02:19.290> boost<00:02:19.500> initially<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.159> once<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
a good boost initially and once the

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.250 
a good boost initially and once the
player<00:02:21.060> card<00:02:21.329> is<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.510> motion<00:02:21.659> then<00:02:21.930> boosters

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
player card is in motion then boosters

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.369 
player card is in motion then boosters
tend<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> work<00:02:22.680> more<00:02:22.709> lively<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.200> we're<00:02:25.200> on

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
tend to work more lively and we're on

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.500 
tend to work more lively and we're on
our<00:02:25.409> way<00:02:25.700> down<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.540> mic<00:02:27.959> our<00:02:28.109> Stern<00:02:28.349> on<00:02:29.510> track

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
our way down the mic our Stern on track

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.849 
our way down the mic our Stern on track
now<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:33.780> particular<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.290> goes<00:02:34.590> underwater

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
now this particular one goes underwater

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.979 
now this particular one goes underwater
so<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.489> look<00:02:35.579> at<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> pirate<00:02:36.090> ship<00:02:36.269> tyrant

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
so we can look at the pirate ship tyrant

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.069 
so we can look at the pirate ship tyrant
ship<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.329> see<00:02:42.450> how<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.629> lag<00:02:43.049> and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
ship you can see how the lag and

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.199 
ship you can see how the lag and
multiplayer<00:02:43.590> tends<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.489> make<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:44.790> seem<00:02:44.969> to<00:02:45.090> go

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
multiplayer tends to make you seem to go

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.819 
multiplayer tends to make you seem to go
slower<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.629> faster<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.500> you're<00:02:46.650> just

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
slower and faster but really you're just

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.800 
slower and faster but really you're just
going<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.099> same<00:02:47.280> speed<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.639> whole<00:02:47.790> way<00:02:47.909> at

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
going the same speed the whole way at

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.309 
going the same speed the whole way at
least<00:02:49.079> according<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.769> surfer<00:02:50.159> yeah

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
least according to the surfer yeah

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.059 
least according to the surfer yeah
that's<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.590> client<00:02:52.889> and<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> server

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
that's just the client and the server

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.670 
that's just the client and the server
synchronizing<00:02:53.849> position<00:02:54.500> there's<00:02:55.500> still<00:02:55.650> a

synchronizing position there's still a

tend to tend to have squid stuck on them

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.490 
tend to tend to have squid stuck on them
I<00:03:02.659> haven't<00:03:03.659> figured<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.959> how<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.169> keep<00:03:04.349> that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
I haven't figured out how to keep that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.250 
I haven't figured out how to keep that
from<00:03:04.650> happening<00:03:04.709> yet<00:03:05.689> so<00:03:06.689> we're<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.109> our<00:03:07.139> way

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
from happening yet so we're on our way

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.929

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
server it's a giant pyramid that's dug

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.500

into the ground by hand everything on
this<00:03:15.689> server<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.169> is<00:03:16.530> legit<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.519> vanilla

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
this server is is legit it's a vanilla

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.129 
this server is is legit it's a vanilla
server<00:03:19.699> so<00:03:20.699> let's<00:03:20.909> go<00:03:21.030> check<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.419> pyramid

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.250 

this<00:03:25.139> was<00:03:25.290> made<00:03:25.470> by<00:03:25.500> Pete<00:03:25.829> Casas<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:26.400> -<00:03:26.549> I

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
this was made by Pete Casas here - I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
this was made by Pete Casas here - I
think<00:03:28.260> my<00:03:28.409> next<00:03:28.470> stop<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.359> developing<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
think my next stop is developing the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.589 
think my next stop is developing the
Morlock<00:03:30.959> skin<00:03:31.439> so<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.829> emerge<00:03:32.099> from<00:03:32.129> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
Morlock skin so I can emerge from the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:40.759 
Morlock skin so I can emerge from the
other<00:03:33.620> server<00:03:37.669> so<00:03:38.669> this<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.260> built<00:03:40.260> by<00:03:40.500> hand

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
other server so this was built by hand

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.460 
other server so this was built by hand
over<00:03:41.250> how<00:03:41.489> long<00:03:42.000> did<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.239> make<00:03:44.030> yeah<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.470> think

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
over how long did this make yeah I think

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.719 
over how long did this make yeah I think
it<00:03:46.560> was<00:03:46.650> five<00:03:46.799> weeks<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.159> doing<00:03:47.340> nothing<00:03:47.459> but

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
it was five weeks of doing nothing but

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:55.080 
it was five weeks of doing nothing but
minecraft<00:03:50.870> so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.510 

we<00:03:55.989> had<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.200> successful<00:03:56.410> trip<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.890> this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
we had a successful trip to this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.820 
we had a successful trip to this
ridiculously<00:03:58.120> huge<00:03:58.330> pyramid<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.900> let's<00:03:59.590> try

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
ridiculously huge pyramid and let's try

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:10.710 
ridiculously huge pyramid and let's try
taking<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.220> trip<00:04:00.370> back<00:04:00.430> now<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:10.300> we<00:04:10.420> can<00:04:10.569> see

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
taking a trip back now and we can see

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.140 
taking a trip back now and we can see
how<00:04:10.870> well<00:04:11.099> boosters<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.370> tracks<00:04:12.790> work<00:04:13.000> and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
how well boosters and tracks work and

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.879 
how well boosters and tracks work and
multiplayer<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.600> not<00:04:16.870> every<00:04:17.320> booster<00:04:17.680> works

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
multiplayer so not every booster works

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.680 
multiplayer so not every booster works
well<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.190> multiplayer<00:04:18.459> but<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.480> picked

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
well in multiplayer but if you picked

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.000 
well in multiplayer but if you picked
the<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:19.930> boosters<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.380> things<00:04:20.739> tend<00:04:20.919> to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the right boosters that things tend to

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.790 
the right boosters that things tend to
work<00:04:21.160> pretty<00:04:21.340> well<00:04:22.320> part<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.470> point<00:04:23.680> of

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
work pretty well part of the point of

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.870 
work pretty well part of the point of
this<00:04:23.889> long<00:04:24.160> track<00:04:24.520> here<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.350> having<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.470> lot<00:04:26.710> of

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
this long track here is having a lot of

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.250 
this long track here is having a lot of
places<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.000> just<00:04:28.030> goes<00:04:28.270> off<00:04:28.450> on<00:04:28.479> extra<00:04:29.050> loops

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
places it just goes off on extra loops

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.780 
places it just goes off on extra loops
so<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:29.680> we<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:29.950> test<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.460> how<00:04:30.610> far

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so that we can test and see how far

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.250 
so that we can test and see how far
boosters<00:04:31.210> send<00:04:31.389> you<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.630> multiplayer<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
boosters send you and multiplayer and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:49.440 
boosters send you and multiplayer and
how<00:04:32.770> reliable<00:04:33.160> they<00:04:33.310> are

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.120 

in<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.110> case<00:04:50.320> we're<00:04:50.500> going<00:04:50.680> back<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.040> the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
in this case we're going back to the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.120 
in this case we're going back to the
minecart<00:04:51.520> station<00:04:52.380> eventually<00:04:53.380> yeah<00:04:56.130> first

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
minecart station eventually yeah first

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.850 
minecart station eventually yeah first
we<00:04:57.250> have<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.430> go<00:04:57.520> up<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.730> tower

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.189 

then<00:05:03.490> we<00:05:03.580> go<00:05:03.699> back<00:05:03.729> down<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> tower

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.600 

then<00:05:10.590> we<00:05:10.710> go<00:05:10.800> over<00:05:10.949> here<00:05:10.979> this<00:05:11.249> isn't<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
then we go over here this isn't the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.640 
then we go over here this isn't the
MicroStation<00:05:12.150> hider<00:05:15.139> it's<00:05:16.139> getting<00:05:16.379> closer

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
MicroStation hider it's getting closer

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.520 
MicroStation hider it's getting closer
though<00:05:16.830> yeah

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:31.050 

being<00:05:22.750> poor

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.170 

you<00:05:31.810> can<00:05:31.930> see<00:05:32.050> how<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.230> occasional<00:05:32.770> leg<00:05:33.180> tends

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
you can see how the occasional leg tends

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
you can see how the occasional leg tends
to<00:05:34.450> I<00:05:35.370> make<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.490> not<00:05:36.639> look<00:05:36.669> very<00:05:36.820> good<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:37.480> it

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
to I make it not look very good but it

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.330 
to I make it not look very good but it
seems<00:05:38.470> like<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.740> minecart<00:05:39.070> is<00:05:39.130> pretty

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
seems like the minecart is pretty

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:50.650 
seems like the minecart is pretty
reliable

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.380 

and<00:05:50.750> now<00:05:51.590> we're<00:05:51.770> back<00:05:51.890> at<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.190> Taoiseach<00:05:52.390> the

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
and now we're back at the Taoiseach the

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.480 
and now we're back at the Taoiseach the
station<00:05:53.780> has<00:05:53.990> 12<00:05:54.500> different<00:05:54.590> little<00:05:55.100> arrival

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
station has 12 different little arrival

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.030 
station has 12 different little arrival
stations<00:05:55.910> they're<00:05:56.120> very<00:05:56.330> simple<00:05:56.890> just<00:05:57.890> a

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
stations they're very simple just a

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.430 
stations they're very simple just a
pressure<00:05:59.000> plate<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.570> redirects<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.200> next

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
pressure plate that redirects the next

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.350 
pressure plate that redirects the next
part<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:01.220> next<00:06:01.430> station<00:06:01.610> if<00:06:01.940> there's

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
part to the next station if there's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.760 
part to the next station if there's
someone<00:06:02.660> here<00:06:02.810> still<00:06:03.290> getting<00:06:03.500> out<00:06:03.590> of<00:06:03.680> their

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
someone here still getting out of their

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.890 
someone here still getting out of their
minecart

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
minecart

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.990 
minecart
so<00:06:06.100> that's<00:06:07.100> it<00:06:07.280> for<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.460> first<00:06:07.640> look<00:06:07.820> at<00:06:07.940> the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
so that's it for the first look at the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.180 
so that's it for the first look at the
minecart<00:06:08.360> station<00:06:08.560> next<00:06:09.560> up<00:06:09.740> we're<00:06:09.950> going<00:06:10.070> to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
minecart station next up we're going to

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.710 
minecart station next up we're going to
have<00:06:10.640> some<00:06:10.880> videos<00:06:11.150> where<00:06:11.270> we<00:06:11.390> look<00:06:11.510> at<00:06:11.630> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
have some videos where we look at the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.710 
have some videos where we look at the
internals<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:12.260> how<00:06:12.320> it's<00:06:12.470> constructed<00:06:12.680> and

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
internals and how it's constructed and

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.640 
internals and how it's constructed and
look<00:06:14.720> at<00:06:14.870> how<00:06:14.990> you<00:06:15.050> can<00:06:15.170> make<00:06:15.380> one<00:06:15.410> for

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
look at how you can make one for

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.990 
look at how you can make one for
yourself<00:06:15.980> or<00:06:16.130> how<00:06:16.220> you<00:06:16.280> can<00:06:16.430> copy<00:06:16.640> this<00:06:16.820> one

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
yourself or how you can copy this one

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.750 
yourself or how you can copy this one
thanks
