okay<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.870> let's<00:00:40.230> go<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> do

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
okay so let's go to it what do you do

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
okay so let's go to it what do you do
first<00:00:41.070> well<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.550> place<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> start<00:00:41.910> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
first well the first place to start is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
first well the first place to start is
to<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:43.290> drape<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> tie<00:00:44.070> around<00:00:44.219> your

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to just get drape the tie around your

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.889 
to just get drape the tie around your
neck<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> right

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
neck and then you want to get the right

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
neck and then you want to get the right
size<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> wider<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.210> about

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
size so that the wider end is about

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.500 
size so that the wider end is about
halfway<00:00:49.190> further<00:00:50.190> past<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> narrowing<00:00:51.239> okay

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
halfway further past the narrowing okay

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.880 
halfway further past the narrowing okay
okay<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> place<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> start<00:00:52.590> gonna

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
okay so that's the place to start gonna

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.959 
okay so that's the place to start gonna
have<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> mini<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have like a mini time I would have a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
have like a mini time I would have a
little<00:00:54.180> mini<00:00:54.300> tie<00:00:54.570> exactly<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.219> might

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
little mini tie exactly and you might

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.500 
little mini tie exactly and you might
have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> try<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> few<00:00:56.969> different<00:00:57.360> times

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have to try it a few different times

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
have to try it a few different times
because<00:00:57.750> different<00:00:58.170> ties<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.800> different

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
because different ties have different

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
because different ties have different
lengths<00:00:59.399> okay<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.030> never<00:01:00.120> gonna<00:01:00.300> get

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
lengths okay so you're never gonna get

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
lengths okay so you're never gonna get
it<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:00.899> try<00:01:01.109> normally<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.920> first

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
it on the first try normally the first

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.560 
it on the first try normally the first
step<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.460> tying<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> four-in-hand<00:01:03.090> knot<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
step in tying a four-in-hand knot is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.850 
step in tying a four-in-hand knot is
simply<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> put<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> tie<00:01:04.379> around<00:01:04.500> your<00:01:04.739> neck

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
simply to put the tie around your neck

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
simply to put the tie around your neck
and<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.580> figure<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.210> length<00:01:06.540> about

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and to figure out the right length about

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
and to figure out the right length about
half<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.979> possibly<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.700> less<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
half way or possibly a little less for

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
half way or possibly a little less for
the<00:01:09.600> narrow<00:01:09.810> end<00:01:10.049> compared<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> longer

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the narrow end compared to the longer

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
the narrow end compared to the longer
end<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> wide<00:01:12.930> end<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> tie<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
end you take the wide end of the tie and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
end you take the wide end of the tie and
the<00:01:13.799> first<00:01:14.159> step<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> bring<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> around

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the first step is to bring it around

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.190 
the first step is to bring it around
like<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> simply<00:01:18.869> bring<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
like that then you simply bring it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.030 
like that then you simply bring it
towards<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> front<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:21.330> wrap<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.630> around<00:01:22.040> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
towards the front you wrap it around and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160 
towards the front you wrap it around and
now<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> four-in-hand

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
now you can see that the four-in-hand

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
now you can see that the four-in-hand
knot<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.590> starting<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> take<00:01:26.130> shape<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.119> final

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
knot is starting to take shape the final

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
knot is starting to take shape the final
step<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.380> bring<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.189> wide<00:01:29.400> end<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.880> through

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
step is to bring the wide end up through

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.319 
step is to bring the wide end up through
the<00:01:30.479> loop<00:01:30.630> created<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.560> neck<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.240> put<00:01:33.240> it
