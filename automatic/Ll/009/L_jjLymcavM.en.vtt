what<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.060> want<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.390> a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
what you would want for a

what you would want for a
point-and-shoot<00:02:33.810> because<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.470> can<00:02:34.739> stick<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
in your pocket it's pretty much the same

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it's fine on a helmet it's not so good

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.780 
it's fine on a helmet it's not so good
in<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> pocket<00:02:45.980> one<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> weaknesses<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.550> I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
in a pocket one of the weaknesses that I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.400 
in a pocket one of the weaknesses that I
can<00:02:48.000> point<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:48.510> about<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:50.150> cx-5<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:52.140> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
can point out about the cx-5 that's the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.199 
can point out about the cx-5 that's the
second<00:02:52.799> generation<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.850> right<00:02:54.030> here

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
second generation that I have right here

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.780 
second generation that I have right here
over<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> place<00:02:54.690> bore<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.709> they<00:02:56.010> decided

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
over the place bore is that they decided

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.080 
over the place bore is that they decided
to<00:02:56.819> do<00:02:57.150> away<00:02:57.330> with<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:58.730> replaceable<00:02:59.730> battery

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
to do away with the replaceable battery

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.850 
to do away with the replaceable battery
so<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.540> one's<00:03:00.720> an<00:03:00.840> internal<00:03:01.319> battery<00:03:01.530> that

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
so this one's an internal battery that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.039 
so this one's an internal battery that
you<00:03:01.920> can't<00:03:02.190> access<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.940> therefore<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
you can't access and therefore that

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.680 
you can't access and therefore that
limits<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:05.010> recording<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.660> said

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
limits your recording time like I said

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.110 
limits your recording time like I said
before<00:03:07.049> that's<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.650> strength<00:03:08.160> for<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.489> GoPro<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
before that's a strength for the GoPro I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.090 
before that's a strength for the GoPro I
think<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.540> battery<00:03:09.959> life<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.410> excellent<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
think the battery life is excellent I

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.370 
think the battery life is excellent I
have<00:03:12.090> never<00:03:12.360> thought<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.900> need<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.260> out

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
have never thought that I need to go out

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.130 
have never thought that I need to go out
and<00:03:13.410> buy<00:03:13.709> an<00:03:14.040> extra<00:03:14.640> battery<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:15.420> if<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.840> did

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
and buy an extra battery but if you did

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.229 
and buy an extra battery but if you did
then<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.920> because<00:03:17.310> GoPro<00:03:17.970> lets<00:03:18.180> you

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
then you can because GoPro lets you

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.520 
then you can because GoPro lets you
access<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.720> battery<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.109> can<00:03:19.170> buy<00:03:19.350> extra

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
access the battery and you can buy extra

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.000 
access the battery and you can buy extra
ones

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
ones

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.490 
ones
the<00:03:20.250> Kodak<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.700> can't<00:03:20.880> do<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.359> once<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.470> are

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the Kodak you can't do that once you are

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.789 
the Kodak you can't do that once you are
out<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.940> think<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.720> core<00:03:25.140> time<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.470> about<00:03:25.620> two

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
out I think the core time is about two

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.130 
out I think the core time is about two
hours<00:03:26.130> then<00:03:26.790> you're<00:03:26.880> out<00:03:27.109> personally<00:03:28.109> I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
hours then you're out personally I

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.560 
hours then you're out personally I
haven't<00:03:28.500> had<00:03:28.829> much<00:03:28.980> trouble<00:03:29.519> with<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> record

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
haven't had much trouble with the record

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.050 
haven't had much trouble with the record
time<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.109> can<00:03:31.310> understand<00:03:32.310> how<00:03:32.640> someone

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
time but I can understand how someone

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.720 
time but I can understand how someone
might<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:34.890> going<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.190> ahead<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
might so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.940 
might so I'm going to go ahead and
compare<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.420> two<00:03:36.450> cameras<00:03:36.989> kind<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.709> put<00:03:37.829> it

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
compare the two cameras kind of put it

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.250 
compare the two cameras kind of put it
into<00:03:38.310> perspective<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:39.720> someone's<00:03:40.079> trying

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
into perspective and if someone's trying

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.620 
into perspective and if someone's trying
to<00:03:40.380> decide<00:03:40.829> by<00:03:41.549> one<00:03:41.850> over<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.150> other

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
to decide by one over the other

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.349 
to decide by one over the other
hopefully<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.500> help<00:03:44.239> starting<00:03:45.239> off

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
hopefully this will help starting off

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.990 
hopefully this will help starting off
with<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> GoPro<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.130> an<00:03:47.459> excellent

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
with the GoPro this is an excellent

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.360 
with the GoPro this is an excellent
point<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.359> view<00:03:48.510> camera<00:03:48.870> can't<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.769> wrong<00:03:49.980> if

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
point of view camera can't go wrong if

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.729 
point of view camera can't go wrong if
you're<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.269> stick<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.260> your<00:03:52.350> helmet

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
you're going to stick it on your helmet

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.220 
you're going to stick it on your helmet
skiing<00:03:53.670> mountain<00:03:53.970> biking<00:03:54.359> any<00:03:54.570> other<00:03:54.780> sport

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.300 
skiing mountain biking any other sport
or<00:03:55.470> activity<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.940> really<00:03:57.390> good<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.690> that

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
or activity it's really good for that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.490 
or activity it's really good for that
what<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.340> wouldn't<00:03:59.760> recommend<00:04:00.319> getting<00:04:01.319> this

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
what I wouldn't recommend getting this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.319 
what I wouldn't recommend getting this
for<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:02.010> if<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.489> think<00:04:02.790> you're<00:04:02.910> going<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.150> be

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
for is if you think you're going to be

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.069 
for is if you think you're going to be
doing<00:04:03.540> more<00:04:04.459> third-person<00:04:05.459> shooting<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
doing more third-person shooting and

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.370 
doing more third-person shooting and
what<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.319> mean<00:04:07.470> by<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.980> trying<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.400> take

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
what I mean by that is trying to take

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.650 
what I mean by that is trying to take
film<00:04:10.380> of<00:04:10.650> someone<00:04:11.069> else<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.209> holding

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
film of someone else just like holding

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.569 
film of someone else just like holding
the<00:04:12.780> camera<00:04:13.019> as<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.380> would<00:04:13.769> another<00:04:14.220> camera

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
the camera as you would another camera

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.300 
the camera as you would another camera
like<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.730> point-and-shoot<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:16.190> haven't<00:04:17.190> had

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
like a point-and-shoot I haven't had

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.979 
like a point-and-shoot I haven't had
much<00:04:17.459> luck<00:04:17.700> using<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.299> like<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.570> because<00:04:18.959> of

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
much luck using it like that because of

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.539 
much luck using it like that because of
the<00:04:19.380> way<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.769> was<00:04:19.889> designed<00:04:20.220> with<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the way that was designed with the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.760 
the way that was designed with the
fisheye<00:04:20.850> lens<00:04:21.320> subjects<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.470> you're<00:04:22.590> trying

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
fisheye lens subjects that you're trying

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.529 
fisheye lens subjects that you're trying
to<00:04:22.890> film<00:04:23.099> or<00:04:23.370> kind<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.669> distant<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.240> far<00:04:24.450> away

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
to film or kind of distant and far away

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.910 
to film or kind of distant and far away
and<00:04:24.930> although<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.620> can<00:04:25.919> purchase<00:04:25.950> those

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
and although you can purchase those

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.290 
and although you can purchase those
pack<00:04:27.190> which<00:04:27.400> would<00:04:27.580> help<00:04:27.760> with<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.910> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
pack which would help with that the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.810 
pack which would help with that the
sound<00:04:29.050> quality<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.500> still<00:04:29.710> bad<00:04:29.950> low<00:04:30.610> light

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
sound quality is still bad low light

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.060 
sound quality is still bad low light
conditions<00:04:31.300> not<00:04:31.480> good<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:32.350> bulky<00:04:32.710> if<00:04:32.950> you're

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
conditions not good it's bulky if you're

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.740 
conditions not good it's bulky if you're
trying<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> put<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.580> pocket<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.420> it's<00:04:34.570> really

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
trying to put in a pocket so it's really

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.780 
trying to put in a pocket so it's really
not<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.990> point-and-shoot<00:04:35.320> camera<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.310> that's

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
not a point-and-shoot camera and that's

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.900 
not a point-and-shoot camera and that's
where<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> Kodak<00:04:37.450> play<00:04:38.080> sport<00:04:38.350> comes<00:04:38.530> in<00:04:38.910> this

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
where the Kodak play sport comes in this

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.750 
where the Kodak play sport comes in this
is<00:04:40.210> like<00:04:40.450> an<00:04:40.600> outdoors<00:04:41.760> point-and-shoot

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
is like an outdoors point-and-shoot

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.720 
is like an outdoors point-and-shoot
camera<00:04:43.120> it's<00:04:43.420> rugged<00:04:44.430> supposedly<00:04:45.430> shockproof

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
camera it's rugged supposedly shockproof

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.820 
camera it's rugged supposedly shockproof
although<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.390> don't<00:04:46.630> want<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.840> test<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.320> because

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
although I don't want to test it because

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.040 
although I don't want to test it because
I<00:04:48.070> think<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.670> GoPro<00:04:49.060> is<00:04:49.240> definitely<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.810> lot

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
I think the GoPro is definitely a lot

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.320 
I think the GoPro is definitely a lot
stronger<00:04:50.380> than<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.920> play<00:04:51.100> sport<00:04:51.400> it's<00:04:52.180> also

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
stronger than the play sport it's also

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.240 
stronger than the play sport it's also
waterproof<00:04:52.750> which<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.320> pretty<00:04:53.950> nice

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
waterproof which is a pretty nice

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.530 
waterproof which is a pretty nice
feature<00:04:54.540> going<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.630> pool<00:04:55.840> or<00:04:57.450> snorkeling<00:04:58.450> I

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
feature going to pool or snorkeling I

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.080 
feature going to pool or snorkeling I
guess<00:04:58.750> although<00:04:58.990> salt<00:04:59.590> isn't<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:00.700> good<00:05:00.850> for

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
guess although salt isn't so good for

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.060 
guess although salt isn't so good for
these<00:05:01.210> cameras<00:05:03.600> but<00:05:04.600> that's<00:05:05.470> really<00:05:05.920> what<00:05:06.040> I

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
these cameras but that's really what I

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.700 
these cameras but that's really what I
bought<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.430> camera<00:05:06.580> for<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.810> was

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
bought the camera for because I was

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.080 
bought the camera for because I was
trying<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.040> use<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.370> GoPro<00:05:09.550> as<00:05:10.030> a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
trying to use the GoPro as a

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.060 
trying to use the GoPro as a
point-and-shoot<00:05:11.050> trying<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.620> film<00:05:11.890> my

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
point-and-shoot trying to film my

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.340 
point-and-shoot trying to film my
friends<00:05:12.580> doing<00:05:12.730> things<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.870> basically

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
friends doing things and basically

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.640 
friends doing things and basically
taking<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.430> off<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.670> helmet<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.570> GoPro<00:05:16.990> isn't

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
taking it off the helmet the GoPro isn't

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.090 
taking it off the helmet the GoPro isn't
very<00:05:17.830> effective<00:05:19.260> again<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:20.410> can<00:05:20.680> use<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:20.980> for

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
very effective again you can use it for

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.450 
very effective again you can use it for
that<00:05:21.220> but<00:05:21.820> that's<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.510> Kodak's<00:05:23.350> strength<00:05:24.010> is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
that but that's the Kodak's strength is

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.810 
that but that's the Kodak's strength is
point<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.270> shoot<00:05:25.480> and<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:26.410> GoPro<00:05:27.130> strength<00:05:27.550> is

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
point to shoot and the GoPro strength is

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.570 
point to shoot and the GoPro strength is
point<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.360> view<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.840> of<00:05:29.710> course<00:05:29.980> the<00:05:30.190> weakness

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
point of view and of course the weakness

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.280 
point of view and of course the weakness
I<00:05:30.820> think<00:05:31.030> of<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> Kodak<00:05:31.600> is<00:05:31.810> that<00:05:31.930> it<00:05:32.050> wouldn't

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
I think of the Kodak is that it wouldn't

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.620 
I think of the Kodak is that it wouldn't
perform<00:05:32.650> as<00:05:33.130> well<00:05:33.190> as<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:33.910> GoPro<00:05:34.240> would<00:05:34.450> for

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
perform as well as the GoPro would for

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.480 
perform as well as the GoPro would for
point<00:05:34.840> of<00:05:34.900> view<00:05:35.110> I'm<00:05:35.950> sure<00:05:36.160> there's<00:05:36.370> people

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
point of view I'm sure there's people

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.130 
point of view I'm sure there's people
that<00:05:36.670> use<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.210> Kodak<00:05:37.510> at<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.780> point<00:05:37.960> of<00:05:38.020> view

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
that use the Kodak at the point of view

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.140 
that use the Kodak at the point of view
camera<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.650> they<00:05:38.710> probably<00:05:38.920> do<00:05:39.190> fine<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.670> think

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
camera and they probably do fine I think

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.580 
camera and they probably do fine I think
they'd<00:05:40.270> be<00:05:40.300> better<00:05:40.420> off<00:05:40.660> with<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.020> GoPro<00:05:41.380> and

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
