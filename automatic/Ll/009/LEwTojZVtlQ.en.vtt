00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
tomorrow's get that wiring changed
almost<00:01:16.860> most<00:01:17.159> likely<00:01:17.490> gonna<00:01:17.610> happen<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> we're

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
almost most likely gonna happen is we're

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
almost most likely gonna happen is we're
gonna<00:01:18.869> cut<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> harness<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.900> basically<00:01:21.900> cut

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
gonna cut the harness and basically cut

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
gonna cut the harness and basically cut
the<00:01:22.229> wire<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.070> splice<00:01:23.490> another<00:01:23.820> wire<00:01:24.030> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the wire you know splice another wire in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
the wire you know splice another wire in
and<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> properly<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> stuff

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and do it properly with all the stuff

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.300 
and do it properly with all the stuff
and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:26.820> why<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> harness<00:01:27.600> backup<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
and then why are the harness backup and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
and then why are the harness backup and
hopefully<00:01:29.310> you'll<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.490> good<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.479> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
hopefully you'll be good to go and we be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
hopefully you'll be good to go and we be
back<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.820> four-speaker<00:01:32.820> Wellman's

you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.710> system<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> or<00:01:38.159> instead<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you know system back in or instead of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
you know system back in or instead of
the<00:01:38.610> standard<00:01:38.909> 5<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.049> suppose<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the standard 5 I think I suppose the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.980 
the standard 5 I think I suppose the
tweeter<00:01:40.590> still<00:01:40.860> working<00:01:41.100> her<00:01:41.159> doors<00:01:41.990> but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tweeter still working her doors but
