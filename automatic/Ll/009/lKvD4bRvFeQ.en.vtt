00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
range all right now let's compare this

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.860 
range all right now let's compare this
to<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.360> generic<00:02:48.569> light<00:02:49.250> right<00:02:50.250> hold<00:02:50.489> on

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
to just a generic light right hold on

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.570 
to just a generic light right hold on
this<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.410> generic<00:02:52.560> light<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.430> going

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
this is just a generic light I'm going

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.630 
this is just a generic light I'm going
to<00:02:53.670> point<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:55.200> little<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:56.340> tiny

to point it at that little that tiny
little<00:02:56.730> hill<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.269> snow<00:02:57.510> there<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.980> that's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
little hill of snow there but that's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.600 
little hill of snow there but that's
what<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.489> generic<00:02:59.940> light<00:03:00.180> looks<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.780> and

remember it has the touch act or the
touch<00:06:35.370> mode<00:06:35.700> changing<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.570> don't

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
touch mode changing so you don't

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.740 
touch mode changing so you don't
actually<00:06:36.990> need<00:06:37.230> like<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> ton<00:06:38.130> of<00:06:38.210> traction<00:06:39.210> to

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
actually need like a ton of traction to

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.350 
actually need like a ton of traction to
actually<00:06:40.260> be<00:06:41.160> turning<00:06:41.580> that<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:42.000> can<00:06:42.150> just

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
actually be turning that you can just

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.140 
actually be turning that you can just
use<00:06:42.570> you<00:06:42.840> can<00:06:42.960> switch<00:06:43.500> modes<00:06:43.800> that<00:06:43.950> way<00:06:44.400> the

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
use you can switch modes that way the

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.810 
use you can switch modes that way the
high<00:06:45.360> mode<00:06:45.600> is<00:06:45.780> 200<00:06:46.320> lumens<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:47.160> turbo<00:06:47.580> mode

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
high mode is 200 lumens the turbo mode

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.740 
high mode is 200 lumens the turbo mode
is<00:06:48.030> 300<00:06:48.960> lumens<00:06:49.580> that's<00:06:50.580> pretty<00:06:51.000> good<00:06:51.270> i<00:06:51.330> mean

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
is 300 lumens that's pretty good i mean

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.580 
is 300 lumens that's pretty good i mean
for<00:06:52.440> for<00:06:52.830> such<00:06:53.010> a<00:06:53.040> compact<00:06:53.820> light<00:06:54.300> now<00:06:55.290> as<00:06:55.470> you

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
for for such a compact light now as you

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.040 
for for such a compact light now as you
can<00:06:55.710> see<00:06:55.770> from<00:06:56.040> the<00:06:56.220> demo<00:06:56.670> this<00:06:57.540> is<00:06:57.720> a<00:06:57.750> lot<00:06:58.020> more

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
can see from the demo this is a lot more

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.310 
can see from the demo this is a lot more
focused<00:06:58.980> like<00:06:59.190> it<00:06:59.340> has<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.460> really<00:07:00.080> tight<00:07:01.080> and

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
focused like it has a really tight and

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.940 
focused like it has a really tight and
very<00:07:01.410> bright<00:07:02.310> hot<00:07:02.730> spot<00:07:03.210> what<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.260> means<00:07:04.620> is

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
very bright hot spot what that means is

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.010 
very bright hot spot what that means is
that<00:07:04.980> unlike<00:07:05.610> most<00:07:05.910> lights<00:07:06.330> of<00:07:06.630> this<00:07:06.900> size<00:07:09.020> it

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
that unlike most lights of this size it

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.320 
that unlike most lights of this size it
has<00:07:10.200> more<00:07:10.530> throw<00:07:10.980> and<00:07:11.280> it's<00:07:11.760> less<00:07:12.030> of<00:07:12.210> a

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
has more throw and it's less of a

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.700 
has more throw and it's less of a
floodlight<00:07:12.870> okay<00:07:13.350> so<00:07:14.810> rather<00:07:15.810> than<00:07:16.110> just<00:07:16.440> a

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
floodlight okay so rather than just a

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.930 
floodlight okay so rather than just a
wide<00:07:17.130> angle<00:07:17.520> wall<00:07:18.510> of<00:07:18.750> light<00:07:18.990> at<00:07:19.260> short<00:07:19.650> range

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
wide angle wall of light at short range

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.600 
wide angle wall of light at short range
it<00:07:20.940> actually<00:07:21.180> has<00:07:21.800> it's<00:07:22.800> almost<00:07:23.070> like<00:07:23.280> a<00:07:23.310> mini

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
it actually has it's almost like a mini

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.330 
it actually has it's almost like a mini
spotlight<00:07:24.470> basically<00:07:25.470> it<00:07:25.590> gives<00:07:25.800> you<00:07:26.040> more

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
spotlight basically it gives you more

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.640 
spotlight basically it gives you more
range<00:07:26.820> and<00:07:27.300> you<00:07:27.480> can<00:07:27.600> even<00:07:27.720> see<00:07:27.840> that<00:07:28.230> in<00:07:28.440> that

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
range and you can even see that in that

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.280 
range and you can even see that in that
right<00:07:29.580> you<00:07:29.790> can<00:07:29.940> see<00:07:30.150> that<00:07:30.180> beam<00:07:30.630> right<00:07:30.900> there

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
right you can see that beam right there

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.530 
right you can see that beam right there
okay<00:07:32.040> so<00:07:32.100> i<00:07:32.310> hope<00:07:32.520> you<00:07:32.640> enjoyed<00:07:33.000> seeing<00:07:33.330> this
