00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
land and a breeze kicks in no I my first

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.700 
land and a breeze kicks in no I my first
thought<00:01:40.039> was<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.550> was<00:01:41.240> probably<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
thought was that was probably the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.609 
thought was that was probably the
problem<00:01:42.710> as<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.429> what<00:01:43.610> happened<00:01:43.789> but<00:01:44.179> uh<00:01:45.050> that

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
problem as to what happened but uh that

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.389 
problem as to what happened but uh that
I<00:01:45.979> don't<00:01:46.580> think<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.090> was<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.240> whole<00:01:47.600> thing

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
I don't think that was the whole thing

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.580 
I don't think that was the whole thing
because<00:01:49.929> right<00:01:50.929> here<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.070> see<00:01:53.470> might<00:01:54.470> be

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590

so I just hit the out of instinct I just

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.059 
so I just hit the out of instinct I just
hit<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.300> auto<00:02:44.300> rotate<00:02:44.989> switch<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.769> shut

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
hit the auto rotate switch that is shut

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.580 
hit the auto rotate switch that is shut
off<00:02:46.190> switch<00:02:46.400> should<00:02:46.670> every<00:02:46.970> call<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:48.560> came

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
off switch should every call and it came

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.970 
off switch should every call and it came
down<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.420> then<00:02:50.420> came<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.930> its<00:02:51.050> side<00:02:51.290> since<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
down and then came on its side since the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.100 
down and then came on its side since the
tail<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.250> spins<00:02:52.940> out<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.150> control<00:02:53.269> over<00:02:53.599> time

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
tail just spins out of control over time

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.880 
tail just spins out of control over time
it's<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.430> motor<00:02:55.640> tail<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.200> nothing

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
it's just a motor tail but nothing

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.949 
it's just a motor tail but nothing
visible<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.640> think<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.209> might<00:02:59.569> have<00:02:59.599> bent<00:02:59.870> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
visible I think I might have bent the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.440 
visible I think I might have bent the
main<00:03:00.230> shaft<00:03:00.730> everything<00:03:01.730> works<00:03:01.940> up<00:03:02.209> for<00:03:02.360> that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
main shaft everything works up for that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.780 
main shaft everything works up for that
bawling-crying<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.260> come<00:03:03.410> apart<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:04.010> check
