time to go to machine shop and
accessibility<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.320> anyway<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
accessibility all that anyway just to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000 
accessibility all that anyway just to
review<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> problem<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.330> had<00:00:18.980> when<00:00:19.980> we

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
review here the problem I had when we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
review here the problem I had when we
had<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.279> running<00:00:20.580> had<00:00:21.260> these<00:00:22.260> type<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
had it running had these type of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.529 
had it running had these type of
couplings<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> rubber

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
couplings on it there with the rubber

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
couplings on it there with the rubber
between<00:00:25.140> them<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.939> it<00:00:26.939> split<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.840> here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
between them and it split the one here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.179 
between them and it split the one here
off<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.769> back<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> number<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.640> cylinder<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
off of the back a number one cylinder so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
off of the back a number one cylinder so
after<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.700> thirty<00:00:32.940> seconds<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
after about what thirty seconds of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.799 
after about what thirty seconds of
running

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
running

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
running
so<00:00:34.469> anyways<00:00:34.820> decided<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> new

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so anyways decided to go with the new

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
so anyways decided to go with the new
design<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.250> piece<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.829> called<00:00:40.829> UHMW

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
design here it's a piece of called UHMW

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.190 
design here it's a piece of called UHMW
plastic<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.420> almost<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.840> you're<00:00:42.989> crazy

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
plastic it's almost like you're crazy

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.340 
plastic it's almost like you're crazy
carpet<00:00:43.800> plastic<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.399> something<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.350> fairly

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
carpet plastic or something but fairly

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
carpet plastic or something but fairly
slippery<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.520> got<00:00:47.610> some

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
slippery but you know it's got some

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.569 
slippery but you know it's got some
strength<00:00:48.059> too<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.340> machine<00:00:50.340> steel

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
strength too and then machine steel

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.990 
strength too and then machine steel
shaft<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.850> each<00:00:54.000> side<00:00:54.300> basically<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> well

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
shaft on each side basically so well

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.260 
shaft on each side basically so well
just<00:00:57.440> go<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.859> bit<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.940> drive

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
just go over a little bit and to drive

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
just go over a little bit and to drive
it<00:01:00.590> we<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> set<00:01:02.309> screw<00:01:02.550> machined<00:01:04.040> halfway

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it we put a set screw machined halfway

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.880 
it we put a set screw machined halfway
between<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> shaft<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.890> collar

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
between the shaft and the collar

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.590 
between the shaft and the collar
whatever<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> call<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
whatever you want to call it there you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.640 
whatever you want to call it there you
can<00:01:10.080> see<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> end<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
can see at the end of this one here and

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
can see at the end of this one here and
threads<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
threads in there had to do that on a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
threads in there had to do that on a
mill<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.409> was<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.799> interesting

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
mill that that was an interesting

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.749 
mill that that was an interesting
operation<00:01:18.140> setting<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> engine<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.759> but

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
operation setting the engine up but

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.810 
operation setting the engine up but
anyways<00:01:21.060> new<00:01:21.450> couplings<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:23.119> we<00:01:24.119> have

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
anyways new couplings here we have

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
anyways new couplings here we have
countersunk<00:01:26.820> head<00:01:28.280> bolts<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
countersunk head bolts two of them so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160 
countersunk head bolts two of them so
these<00:01:31.320> bolts<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.009> attached<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.170> far

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
these bolts in here attached to the far

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.910 
these bolts in here attached to the far
collar<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.490> through<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> UHMW<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.290> then

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
collar here through the UHMW and then

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.580 
collar here through the UHMW and then
there's<00:01:38.130> two<00:01:38.340> similar<00:01:39.150> ones<00:01:39.360> coming<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
there's two similar ones coming here and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.190 
there's two similar ones coming here and
here<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> plastics<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.689> anything<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
here so the plastics do anything that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.889 
here so the plastics do anything that
drives<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.829> between<00:01:44.159> there's<00:01:44.399> no

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
drives it in between there's no

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
drives it in between there's no
mechanical<00:01:45.899> connection<00:01:46.380> between<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.860> two

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
mechanical connection between the two

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:47.600 
mechanical connection between the two
shafts

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
shafts

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.060 
shafts
although<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> plastic<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
although the plastic it's you know it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.160 
although the plastic it's you know it's
not<00:01:50.250> near<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.610> soft<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.030> rubber<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
not near as soft as rubber is so and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.399 
not near as soft as rubber is so and
then<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.369> made<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.759> was

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
then the way I actually made it was

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.969 
then the way I actually made it was
machined<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.619> disks<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.079> UHMW<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.320> then

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
machined the disks and the UHMW and then

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.260 
machined the disks and the UHMW and then
stuck<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> piece<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.630> rod<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.439> align<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
stuck a piece of rod down it to align it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.109 
stuck a piece of rod down it to align it
welded<00:02:06.270> these<00:02:06.530> two<00:02:07.530> bars<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
welded these two bars to it and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.820 
welded these two bars to it and
proceeded<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> melt<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> plastic

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
proceeded to melt some of the plastic

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
proceeded to melt some of the plastic
but

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
but

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.580 
but
anyway<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:15.470> set<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.830> mill<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.540> put

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
anyway then set it in a mill and put

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.000 
anyway then set it in a mill and put
four<00:02:19.590> holes<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.800> drill<00:02:22.800> large

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
four holes in it and then drill large

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.440 
four holes in it and then drill large
you're<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.250> countersink<00:02:23.760> two<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.060> them<00:02:24.209> then

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
you're in countersink two of them then

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.809 
you're in countersink two of them then
flip<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.440> upside<00:02:25.890> down<00:02:25.920> countersink<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
flip it upside down countersink the

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.300 
flip it upside down countersink the
other<00:02:27.000> two<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.170> been<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:29.099> know<00:02:29.190> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
other two so it's been you know it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
other two so it's been you know it
doesn't<00:02:29.489> look<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.239> all<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.599> much

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
doesn't look all that like all that much

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
doesn't look all that like all that much
but<00:02:31.049> it's<00:02:31.230> been<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.799> lot<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.129> hours<00:02:32.580> making

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
but it's been a lot of hours making

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.320 
but it's been a lot of hours making
these<00:02:33.420> couplings<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.769> when<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.760> assemble

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
these couplings and then when I assemble

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.680 
these couplings and then when I assemble
the<00:02:36.690> number<00:02:37.530> three<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.769> four<00:02:37.890> cylinder<00:02:38.430> here

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the number three and four cylinder here

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.559 
the number three and four cylinder here
bear<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.900> me<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.080> second<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:41.180> take<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.390> blow

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
bear with me a second here take you blow

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.550 
bear with me a second here take you blow
get<00:02:42.959> together<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:46.849> so<00:02:48.230> I'm<00:02:49.230> hoping<00:02:49.500> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
get together there so I'm hoping that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.500 
get together there so I'm hoping that
shows<00:02:49.860> up<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> video<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.880> happens<00:02:51.269> here

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
shows up on the video what happens here

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.170 
shows up on the video what happens here
is<00:02:52.140> why<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.530> close<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.760> distance

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
is why it's close that the distance

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
is why it's close that the distance
between<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.660> cylinder<00:02:55.220> top<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
between the cylinder top of the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.430 
between the cylinder top of the
cylinders<00:02:56.819> here<00:02:59.599> and<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.110> wiggle

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
cylinders here and you see it wiggle

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.770 
cylinders here and you see it wiggle
there<00:03:03.709> move<00:03:04.709> back<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.129> forth<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.360> what<00:03:06.629> that's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
there move back and forth so what that's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.699 
there move back and forth so what that's
telling<00:03:06.930> me<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.360> end<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.530> number

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
telling me is that the end of number

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.289 
telling me is that the end of number
four<00:03:11.069> crankshaft<00:03:11.640> appears<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.569> warped<00:03:13.099> so

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
four crankshaft appears to be warped so

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.000 
four crankshaft appears to be warped so
that's<00:03:15.299> caused<00:03:16.170> me<00:03:16.470> some<00:03:16.680> grief<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.750> I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
that's caused me some grief there I

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.500 
that's caused me some grief there I
think<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> way<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.310> solve<00:03:20.639> it<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.000> machine

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
think the way to solve it is to machine

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.910 
think the way to solve it is to machine
the<00:03:21.690> face<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:23.190> disc<00:03:24.049> since<00:03:25.049> I've

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the face of this disc since I've

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
the face of this disc since I've
measured<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:27.090> disc<00:03:27.299> itself<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:29.120> true<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
measured and the disc itself is true to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.050 
measured and the disc itself is true to
all<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.170> half<00:03:31.500> thousand<00:03:31.980> seven<00:03:32.220> inch<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.639> had

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
all the half thousand seven inch I had

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.759 
all the half thousand seven inch I had
to<00:03:33.180> sand<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.139> way<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.319> when

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
to sand it to get it that way that when

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.410 
to sand it to get it that way that when
I<00:03:34.799> welded<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.519> swelled<00:03:35.819> up<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.239> few

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I welded it it swelled up in a few

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.199 
I welded it it swelled up in a few
places<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:38.090> anyway<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:40.069> I'm<00:03:41.069> I'm<00:03:41.700> working<00:03:41.940> on

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
places but anyway so I'm I'm working on

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.870 
places but anyway so I'm I'm working on
this<00:03:42.389> Frank<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.840> Briggs<00:03:43.049> bore<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.430> just

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
this Frank and Briggs bore here but just

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.979 
this Frank and Briggs bore here but just
having<00:03:45.209> some<00:03:45.680> difficulties<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.069> and

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
having some difficulties with it and

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.830 
having some difficulties with it and
hopefully<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.410> work<00:03:49.859> them<00:03:50.340> out<00:03:50.430> because

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
hopefully we can work them out because

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.190 
hopefully we can work them out because
the<00:03:51.840> amount<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:53.150> misalignment<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.690> has<00:03:54.870> there

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
the amount of misalignment it has there

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.009 
the amount of misalignment it has there
it<00:03:55.739> would<00:03:56.370> shake<00:03:56.609> itself<00:03:56.940> apart<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.389> like<00:03:57.780> no

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
it would shake itself apart in like no

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.330 
it would shake itself apart in like no
time<00:03:58.609> so<00:03:59.609> anyway<00:04:00.450> just<00:04:00.660> wanted<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.319> update<00:04:01.919> you

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
time so anyway just wanted to update you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.590 
time so anyway just wanted to update you
on<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:03.109> have<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.139> good<00:04:04.380> one
