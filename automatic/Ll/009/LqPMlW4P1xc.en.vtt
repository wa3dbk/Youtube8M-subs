dried plaster getting into my mold or it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
dried plaster getting into my mold or it
could<00:05:17.890> affect<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> bait<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.950> try<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.460> just

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
could affect the bait so I I try to just

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.610 
could affect the bait so I I try to just
mix<00:05:21.910> them<00:05:22.090> up<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.450> then<00:05:22.690> I'll<00:05:22.810> flip<00:05:23.020> I'll<00:05:23.260> flip

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
mix them up and then I'll flip I'll flip

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.770 
mix them up and then I'll flip I'll flip
the<00:05:23.740> end<00:05:23.890> over<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.310> use<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> other<00:05:24.580> end<00:05:24.940> then

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
the end over and use the other end then

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.890 
the end over and use the other end then
I<00:05:25.870> throw<00:05:26.080> it<00:05:26.170> away<00:05:27.360> but<00:05:28.360> these<00:05:28.480> things<00:05:28.690> are

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
I throw it away but these things are

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.950 
I throw it away but these things are
super<00:05:29.080> cheap<00:05:29.470> also
