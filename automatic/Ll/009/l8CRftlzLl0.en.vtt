awesomeness of a Teslin said I was just
you<00:00:30.480> know<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:30.660> had<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> explain<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.470> just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you know we had to explain I was just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
you know we had to explain I was just
experimenting<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:33.450> different<00:00:33.570> types

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
experimenting on all different types

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
experimenting on all different types
types<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.620> charging<00:00:34.980> stations<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.090> was

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
types of charging stations and I was

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
types of charging stations and I was
just<00:00:36.809> happened<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.320> coming<00:00:37.440> past<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.070> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
just happened to be coming past here and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
just happened to be coming past here and
I<00:00:38.280> figured<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> heck<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.210> needed<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.930> few

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I figured what the heck I needed a few

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.190 
I figured what the heck I needed a few
extra<00:00:40.140> amps<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:41.480> wats<00:00:42.480> excuse<00:00:43.140> me<00:00:43.370> now

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
extra amps there wats excuse me now

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.510 
extra amps there wats excuse me now
because<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> voltage<00:00:46.680> say<00:00:47.129> even<00:00:47.430> though

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
because the voltage say even though

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.229 
because the voltage say even though
we're<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:48.050> 29<00:00:49.050> /<00:00:49.440> 30<00:00:49.770> amps<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:51.180> only

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
we're at 29 / 30 amps we're only

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
we're at 29 / 30 amps we're only

this<00:01:20.640> past<00:01:20.939> weekend<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:22.640> was<00:01:23.640> expecting<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
this past weekend I was expecting a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.530 
this past weekend I was expecting a
little<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.810> 31<00:01:25.560> miles<00:01:25.830> per<00:01:26.130> hour

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
little more like 31 miles per hour

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
little more like 31 miles per hour
recharge<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:28.950> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
recharge on that which was what I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.819 
recharge on that which was what I
thought<00:01:29.280> Tesla<00:01:29.820> had<00:01:30.000> said<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.140> even<00:01:31.619> even

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
thought Tesla had said but even even

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.990 
thought Tesla had said but even even
even<00:01:32.549> mean<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.220> me<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.759> five

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
even mean that that got me going in five

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
even mean that that got me going in five
hours<00:01:36.210> got<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> full<00:01:36.810> charge<00:01:37.079> doing<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> one

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
hours got a full charge doing that one

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.850 
hours got a full charge doing that one
in<00:01:37.890> five<00:01:38.100> hours<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
in five hours but right now this is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.350 
in five hours but right now this is
pretty<00:01:41.340> damn<00:01:41.759> sad<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.189> emergency<00:01:44.640> plug-in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pretty damn sad as an emergency plug-in

going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.110> 30<00:01:49.380> amps<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.460> pretty<00:01:50.790> sad

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
going to be 30 amps that's pretty sad

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
going to be 30 amps that's pretty sad
but<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.290> most<00:01:52.799> part<00:01:53.100> free<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.670> if

get away with 8 gauge instead of six

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.090 
get away with 8 gauge instead of six
gauge<00:02:38.880> wiring<00:02:39.440> which<00:02:40.440> would<00:02:40.650> save<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
gauge wiring which would save you a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.880 
gauge wiring which would save you a
bunch<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.819> money<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.650> at<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.860> cost<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:45.890> four

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.570 

so<00:02:55.620> that's<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.920> Atticus<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.010> don't

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
so that's it this is Atticus I don't

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.530 
so that's it this is Atticus I don't
really<00:02:59.790> want<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.440> name<00:03:01.440> whose<00:03:02.400> location<00:03:03.030> this

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
really want to name whose location this

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:13.520 
really want to name whose location this
is<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.090> charging<00:03:06.690> there

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.790 

this<00:03:14.069> one<00:03:14.280> seems<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:15.330> better

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
this one seems to be a little better

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:27.929 
this one seems to be a little better

that could explain some of the voltage
drop<00:07:34.969> as<00:07:35.479> well<00:07:35.689> but<00:07:35.930> that's<00:07:36.050> still<00:07:38.199> quite<00:07:39.199> a

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 
drop as well but that's still quite a
