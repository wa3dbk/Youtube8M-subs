00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Monday I mean I thought the first time

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.970 
Monday I mean I thought the first time
that<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.950> saw<00:00:50.129> Fred<00:00:50.430> Seth<00:00:50.730> Rollins<00:00:50.969> after<00:00:51.980> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
because why would you have anything else
I'm<00:01:55.500> sure<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.310> they've<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.479> this

new<00:01:57.930> design<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> his<00:01:58.590> new<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
new design and his new look and more

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
new design and his new look and more
likely<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.450> him<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.719> monday<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.170> he

likely when we see him on monday if he

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.510
