which came out of the year 2000 which is
kind<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.330> crazy<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.929> see<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.469> sequel

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
kind of crazy to see that this sequel

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
kind of crazy to see that this sequel
took<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.670> long<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:15.179> out<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.630> honestly<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
took so long to get out but honestly it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
took so long to get out but honestly it
was<00:00:17.100> worth<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.670> wait<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.600> they've<00:00:18.779> been

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
was worth the wait because they've been

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
was worth the wait because they've been
able<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.289> take<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.680> lot<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.250> main<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
able to take a lot of the main and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.050 
able to take a lot of the main and
concepts<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.340> made<00:00:23.340> American<00:00:23.910> McGee's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
concepts of what made American McGee's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
concepts of what made American McGee's
Alice<00:00:24.420> good<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.140> they<00:00:25.350> brought<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.920> over

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
to alice madness returns but at the same

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.730 
to alice madness returns but at the same
time<00:00:29.279> they've<00:00:29.519> improved<00:00:30.240> upon<00:00:30.720> every<00:00:31.320> little

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
time they've improved upon every little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.160 
time they've improved upon every little
detail<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.550> now<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> course<00:00:33.090> let's<00:00:33.510> go<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
detail so now of course let's go on and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.720 
detail so now of course let's go on and
talk<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> biggest<00:00:35.399> things

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
talk about one of the biggest things

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
talk about one of the biggest things
within<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.180> game<00:00:36.420> because<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.320> mixture

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
within this game because it's a mixture

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.880 
within this game because it's a mixture
of<00:00:37.710> both<00:00:38.280> action<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.020> platforming

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
of both action as well as platforming

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
of both action as well as platforming
and<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> platforming<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:42.629> you're

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and so on the platforming side you're

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
and so on the platforming side you're
going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> jumping<00:00:44.070> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
going to have to do a lot of jumping but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.130 
going to have to do a lot of jumping but
in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> original<00:00:44.879> game<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> hard

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
in the original game it's kind of hard

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290 
in the original game it's kind of hard
and<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.710> difficult<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> jump<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and just difficult to jump because you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
and just difficult to jump because you
get<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.870> jump<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
get there's one jump and you kind of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.170 
get there's one jump and you kind of
help<00:00:50.160> her<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.579> while<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
help her for a little while but then you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
help her for a little while but then you
fall<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.940> deciding<00:00:53.940> upon<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
fall down and you know deciding upon and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.330 
fall down and you know deciding upon and
figuring<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.199> where<00:00:55.649> exactly<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:56.280> going

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
figuring out where exactly you're going

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
figuring out where exactly you're going
to<00:00:56.699> land<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.840> difficult<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to land is really difficult in the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
to land is really difficult in the
original<00:00:58.710> game<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.399> improve<00:00:59.879> upon<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
original game but they improve upon that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
original game but they improve upon that
feature<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.739> allowing<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> continuously

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
feature by allowing you to continuously

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
feature by allowing you to continuously
jump<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> air<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:05.100> addition<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
jump in the air and in addition to that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630 
jump in the air and in addition to that
you'll<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.570> able<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> glide<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.950> you're

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you'll be able to glide down as you're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
you'll be able to glide down as you're
falling<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> rush

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
falling so you're not like a rush

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
falling so you're not like a rush
fouling<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.760> fast<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.360> anything<00:01:12.659> like

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
fouling really fast or anything like

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
fouling really fast or anything like
that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that you can take your time with it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
that you can take your time with it
which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> great<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> allows<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
which is great because it allows you to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
which is great because it allows you to
set<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.920> exactly<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.939> land

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
set up where exactly you want to land

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
set up where exactly you want to land
and<00:01:18.390> makes<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.070> do

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and makes it that much more easy to do

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
and makes it that much more easy to do
so<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.479> addition<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.619> though<00:01:22.890> there

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so so in addition to that though there

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
so so in addition to that though there
are<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.850> elements<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.570> been

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
are some other elements that have been

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
are some other elements that have been
brought<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.020> over<00:01:25.619> first<00:01:25.950> off<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.430> mean<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
brought on over first off I mean of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030 
brought on over first off I mean of
course<00:01:27.180> you've<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> action<00:01:28.320> side<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
course you've got on the action side you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.149 
course you've got on the action side you
got<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.430> crazy<00:01:29.850> knife<00:01:30.360> action<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> feels

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
got some crazy knife action but it feels

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.210 
got some crazy knife action but it feels
a<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.229> fluid<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> they're<00:01:34.890> like

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a lot more fluid and they're like

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
a lot more fluid and they're like
there's<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.729> combo<00:01:36.299> systems<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.079> had

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
there's more combo systems to be had

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
there's more combo systems to be had
here<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.280> game<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.060> its

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that you never had in the original game

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.179 
that you never had in the original game
and<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.119> feel<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> lot<00:01:52.439> better<00:01:52.649> than

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and they just feel a lot better than

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
and they just feel a lot better than
what<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.490> did<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> previous<00:01:54.180> game<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
what they did in the previous game and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440 
what they did in the previous game and
at<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> point<00:01:56.189> there<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.880> some<00:01:57.180> new

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
at that point there are some new

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
at that point there are some new
graphics<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.469> here<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.770> course<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
graphics to be had here of course this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.789 
graphics to be had here of course this
is<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> PlayStation<00:02:00.570> 3<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.740> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
is on the PlayStation 3 so you kind of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.310 
is on the PlayStation 3 so you kind of
expect<00:02:02.189> things<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.610> look<00:02:02.909> pretty<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.810> of

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
expect things to look pretty good and of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.749 
expect things to look pretty good and of
course<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.619> can't<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.130> compare<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> game

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
course you can't really compare a game

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.900 
course you can't really compare a game
from<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.210> year<00:02:06.570> 2000<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.649> today's<00:02:08.340> next

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
from the year 2000 to today's next

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
from the year 2000 to today's next
generation<00:02:09.479> platforms<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.319> still<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
generation platforms but still at the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.250 
generation platforms but still at the
same<00:02:11.129> time<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> art<00:02:12.540> style<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.140> they

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
same time I like the art style that they

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
same time I like the art style that they
want<00:02:13.470> with

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
want with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.080 
want with
in<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.140> alice<00:02:14.590> madness<00:02:14.860> returns<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:15.820> it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
in this alice madness returns because it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020 
in this alice madness returns because it
looks<00:02:16.390> really<00:02:17.290> good<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.920> looks<00:02:18.160> solid<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.850> i

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
looks really good it looks solid and i

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.510 
looks really good it looks solid and i
think<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.840> much<00:02:20.260> improved<00:02:20.500> over<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
think it's much improved over the the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.580 
think it's much improved over the the
previous<00:02:21.760> game<00:02:22.270> where<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.810> felt<00:02:23.230> kind<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.530> like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
previous game where it felt kind of like

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.920 
previous game where it felt kind of like
a<00:02:23.710> dungeon<00:02:24.070> crawler<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.660> just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a dungeon crawler with you know just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.900 
a dungeon crawler with you know just
dark<00:02:26.260> corridors<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.100> stuff<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.520> one<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
dark corridors and stuff this one and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.510 
dark corridors and stuff this one and
alice<00:02:28.570> madness<00:02:28.750> returns<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.590> opened<00:02:30.190> up<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
alice madness returns they opened up the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.870 
alice madness returns they opened up the
world<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.380> seeing<00:02:32.380> like<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.950> know<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.520> what

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
world to seeing like you know just what

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.150 
world to seeing like you know just what
exactly<00:02:34.150> Wonderland<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.440> feels<00:02:35.800> like<00:02:36.010> in

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
exactly Wonderland really feels like in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.370 
exactly Wonderland really feels like in
this<00:02:36.280> darker<00:02:36.880> environment<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.020> can<00:02:38.170> see

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
this darker environment and you can see

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.170 
this darker environment and you can see
way<00:02:38.680> off<00:02:38.920> into<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> distance<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.910> things

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
way off into the distance and things

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.390 
way off into the distance and things
look<00:02:40.390> really<00:02:40.840> good<00:02:41.110> also<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.950> characters

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
look really good also the characters

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.370 
look really good also the characters
themselves<00:02:42.580> are<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.300> think<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> lot<00:02:43.870> more

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
themselves are I think a lot more

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.350 
themselves are I think a lot more
creative<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.340> time<00:02:45.670> around<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.239> get

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
creative this time around that you get

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.840 
creative this time around that you get
to<00:02:46.510> see<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> lot<00:02:47.470> more<00:02:47.530> detail<00:02:48.160> within<00:02:48.400> them<00:02:48.700> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
to see a lot more detail within them and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.460 
to see a lot more detail within them and
it<00:02:49.270> just<00:02:49.510> makes<00:02:49.720> them<00:02:49.840> look<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.230> much<00:02:50.440> better

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
it just makes them look that much better

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.560 
it just makes them look that much better
than<00:02:50.950> what<00:02:51.250> they<00:02:51.430> previously<00:02:51.820> did<00:02:52.150> in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
than what they previously did in

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.300 
than what they previously did in
addition<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.470> enemies<00:02:53.830> themselves

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
addition to that the enemies themselves

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.949 
addition to that the enemies themselves
all<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.640> different<00:02:54.820> ways<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.390> order<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.750> kill

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
all have different ways in order to kill

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.530 
all have different ways in order to kill
them<00:02:56.140> so<00:02:56.560> that's<00:02:56.950> really<00:02:57.220> good<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.790> bringing

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
them so that's really good and bringing

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.300 
them so that's really good and bringing
up<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> strategy<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.770> then<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.040> have<00:03:00.190> to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
up like a strategy and then you have to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.280 
up like a strategy and then you have to
actually<00:03:00.430> pay<00:03:00.730> attention<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:01.390> changing<00:03:02.170> up

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
actually pay attention to changing up

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.410 
actually pay attention to changing up
your<00:03:02.320> weapons<00:03:02.680> at<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.220> same<00:03:03.430> time<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.970> there

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
your weapons at the same time and there

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.240 
your weapons at the same time and there
are<00:03:04.570> some<00:03:04.810> nice<00:03:05.080> additional<00:03:05.860> moves<00:03:06.070> that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
are some nice additional moves that

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.640 
are some nice additional moves that
Alice<00:03:06.610> herself<00:03:06.820> has<00:03:07.330> where<00:03:07.930> she<00:03:08.080> can<00:03:08.200> do<00:03:08.350> dash

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
Alice herself has where she can do dash

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.580 
Alice herself has where she can do dash
move<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.459> order<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.790> evade<00:03:10.300> an<00:03:11.020> enemy's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
move so in order to evade an enemy's

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.229 
move so in order to evade an enemy's
attack<00:03:11.980> she<00:03:12.220> can<00:03:12.340> basically<00:03:12.550> turn<00:03:13.000> into<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
attack she can basically turn into a

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.690 
attack she can basically turn into a
bunch<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.540> butterflies<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.140> zip<00:03:14.739> away<00:03:14.980> from

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
bunch of butterflies and zip away from

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.350 
bunch of butterflies and zip away from
the<00:03:16.150> enemy<00:03:16.390> itself<00:03:17.140> which<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.980> is

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the enemy itself which really is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.570 
the enemy itself which really is
enticing<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.830> lot<00:03:20.860> being<00:03:21.459> able

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
enticing and I like it a lot being able

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.390 
enticing and I like it a lot being able

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
to do that and it helps also when you're

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.949 
to do that and it helps also when you're
not<00:03:24.580> fighting<00:03:24.940> an<00:03:25.209> enemy<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.600> you're<00:03:25.840> able

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
not fighting an enemy that you're able

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.690 
not fighting an enemy that you're able
to<00:03:26.170> kind<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.620> zip<00:03:26.860> through<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> level

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
to kind of just zip through the level

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.250 
to kind of just zip through the level
one<00:03:28.090> other<00:03:28.239> thing<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.570> they<00:03:28.750> did<00:03:28.810> definitely

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260

then you lose control of Alice and you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.890 
then you lose control of Alice and you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
time I think as far as the only issue

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.730 
time I think as far as the only issue
that<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.100> had<00:04:35.490> with<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:36.000> game<00:04:36.389> is<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:37.470> fact

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
that I had with this game is the fact

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.140 
that I had with this game is the fact
that<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.669> load<00:04:39.330> times<00:04:39.690> are<00:04:40.080> kind<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.710> bad

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
that the load times are kind of bad

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.700 
that the load times are kind of bad
every<00:04:42.150> now<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.539> then<00:04:42.660> you'll<00:04:42.810> run<00:04:43.080> across<00:04:43.199> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
every now and then you'll run across a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.770 
every now and then you'll run across a
memory<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.430> pick<00:04:44.669> on<00:04:44.699> up<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.240> you'll

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
memory that you pick on up and you'll

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.890 
memory that you pick on up and you'll
receive<00:04:45.990> like<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.770> voiceover<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:48.449> memory

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
receive like a voiceover of a memory

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.860 
receive like a voiceover of a memory
that<00:04:49.169> Alice<00:04:49.860> has<00:04:50.130> encountered<00:04:50.910> previously

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
that Alice has encountered previously

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.499 
that Alice has encountered previously
and<00:04:52.110> at<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.710> same<00:04:52.919> time<00:04:52.979> it's<00:04:53.699> right<00:04:54.240> there

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
and at the same time it's right there

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.110 
and at the same time it's right there
and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.960> game<00:04:55.289> kind<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:55.830> locks<00:04:56.759> up

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and then the game kind of just locks up

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.210 
and then the game kind of just locks up
it's<00:04:57.750> pretty<00:04:58.020> bad<00:04:58.320> in<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.680> regard<00:04:59.070> because

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
it's pretty bad in that regard because

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.400 
it's pretty bad in that regard because
it<00:04:59.490> doesn't<00:05:00.090> take<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.599> split<00:05:00.990> second<00:05:01.320> it

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
it doesn't take like a split second it

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.800 
it doesn't take like a split second it
takes<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.770> couple<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.400> seconds<00:05:02.970> just<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.630> load

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
takes a couple of seconds just to load

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140 
takes a couple of seconds just to load
like<00:05:04.349> an<00:05:04.500> audio<00:05:04.919> clip<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.580> very<00:05:05.880> bizarre

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
like an audio clip it's very bizarre

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.390 
like an audio clip it's very bizarre
that<00:05:06.539> that<00:05:06.750> happens<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.130> think<00:05:08.370> that

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
that that happens but I think that

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.490 
that that happens but I think that
that's<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.820> worst<00:05:09.060> situation<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.289> games

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
that's the worst situation and the games

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.110 
that's the worst situation and the games
never<00:05:10.680> frozen<00:05:11.070> on<00:05:11.340> me<00:05:11.490> or<00:05:11.639> anything<00:05:11.820> like<00:05:11.970> that

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
never frozen on me or anything like that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.290 
never frozen on me or anything like that
it<00:05:12.449> just<00:05:12.479> takes<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.410> while<00:05:13.740> for<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.849> load<00:05:15.120> up

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
it just takes a while for it to load up

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.050 
it just takes a while for it to load up
that<00:05:15.360> one<00:05:15.900> little<00:05:16.229> clip<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:17.520> other<00:05:17.759> than<00:05:17.970> that

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
that one little clip but other than that

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.510 
that one little clip but other than that
I've<00:05:18.570> basically<00:05:18.960> not<00:05:19.590> run<00:05:19.800> into<00:05:20.070> any<00:05:20.250> other

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
I've basically not run into any other

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.339 
I've basically not run into any other
issues<00:05:20.970> in<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.270> regard<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.720> everything's

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
issues in that regard so everything's

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.200 
issues in that regard so everything's
solid<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.979> think<00:05:23.220> with<00:05:23.340> alice<00:05:23.759> madness<00:05:23.970> returns

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
solid I think with alice madness returns

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.180 
solid I think with alice madness returns

you want to rent it or buy it that's
kind<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.400> know<00:05:32.490> up<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.789> you<00:05:32.970> i<00:05:33.270> think<00:05:33.750> i

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
kind of you know up to you i think i

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.909

and<00:05:35.130> rent<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.460> game<00:05:35.699> simply<00:05:36.060> because<00:05:36.479> it

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
and rent this game simply because it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.020 
and rent this game simply because it
doesn't<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.620> multiplayer<00:05:38.340> component<00:05:38.580> to

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
doesn't have a multiplayer component to

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.730 
doesn't have a multiplayer component to
it<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.360> you're<00:05:39.479> kind<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.840> just<00:05:39.900> left<00:05:40.320> with<00:05:40.560> the

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
it so you're kind of just left with the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.890 
it so you're kind of just left with the
single-player<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.699> alice<00:05:42.539> madness<00:05:42.720> returns
