00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello very good everyone I am folk striker 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.590
 and here I bring you a video of my story 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 going up to level 55 is not a video a 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.250
 little old that people are already a little 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.590
 tired of seeing it but when I summarize it without 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.970
 No copyright whatsoever for no music 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.390
 or anything so you do not have more problems 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.739
 with youtube and so while I'm going 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 answering no to your questions that 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.859
 I told you to let me go not so good 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.099
 the first question is matÃ­as vila 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.439
 they are villalon sorry he says he says that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 the one who wants to know what it feels like to do 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 every video and the feeling that you feel 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.300
 When someone tells you that good video 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.620
 well the truth is that this is a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.630
 feeling difficult to express not because 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 do a job that makes it free and 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.460
 you do it well every person likes it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.740
 in let's say that motivates you does not motivate you 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 to keep playing and keep doing 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.690
 more videos and that people then follow 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.420
 saying what they like and others I for 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 example that's why I upload so many videos 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 I love watching how you like to watch me play 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 and the other problem is that I have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.869
 some bumps with youtube that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.850
 it seems that he does not like youtube or 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.799
 I do not know what happens 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.860
 there's a relationship between youtube and me that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.450
 it does not match but it's a good feeling 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.770
 that the truth is not amazing 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.689
 can express with words you have to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 happen and already when they tell you that you are a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 great that of swift keith of his of his 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.960
 idol that you are everything for it that 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.650
 thanks to them 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.049
 they play very well they play they feel like 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.820
 to play thanks to you because that goes up 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.550
 the mood does not make you want to continue 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.909
 making videos and others the truth that is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 a very stressful situation can not be 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.250
 explain with words is very nice 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.300
 Well, the next question is from 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.360
 Danger 2012 that says how many 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.340
 bottles spent to get it out of 1,079 and 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.960
 that if it's true that while the level 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.180
 lower is more likely to mst 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.770
 it has to be the high level or whatever 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.470
 drop in good to start lotteries 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.590
 spend 252 and I need it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.930
 of the 253 but in that in total can 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.140
 have bought more than a thousand lotteries in 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.800
 total in sunny with just my account 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.160
 and it touched me I think it's me I think it's 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.830
 lucky to see because I do not know why 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 Some reason they have him is not that he has 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.790
 more likely not but as 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 buy more lotteries tails of levels 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.320
 low as it may touch as normal 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.920
 will play with the low-level accounts 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.720
 but surely if you buy the same 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 accounts and they have the same 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.330
 colin lottery with your level account 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.260
 high and purchases will have the same 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.930
 same I think it has the same 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.090
 odds is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.560
 it's luck I do not, I do not think it's a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.920
 low level at the high level that has 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 to see the level with a lottery no no 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.480
 I like I understand this that I think 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.159
 it's a rumor that there's someone out there 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.859
 he says it and period but the people believe it 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.980
 I think it's just luck sincerely 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.299
 because it does not have logic that because if 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.159
 there is a higher level and your level more 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.510
 under you touches you and I should not be 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.639
 upside down not the high levels that you 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.019
 touch the low level that is not in my 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.069
 opinion because at low levels there are more 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.349
 that at high levels and I do not know I think that 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.120
 the probability is the same as that 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.760
 leave with the low level accounts not 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.560
 I know it does not think there 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.139
 trick that trick I think it's 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.090
 totally lie that maybe they 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.010
 of secondary weapons buy the lottery 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.950
 and it comes to you by chance it does not mean 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.109
 that is a trick because it touched me without 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.689
 have given him neither a secondary soul nor a 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.280
 nothing came out to me that's luck and point I 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.780
 I showed myself myself by helping and 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.150
 I thought there was some trick there was something 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.799
 but it is not no trick or anything without 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.019
 Do not think there's a trick or anything 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.299
 because people try to cheat you says 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.710
 give me 10,000 of casey and I tell you the trick 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.090
 what tricks and tricks 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.730
 I'm not an asshole nor do I swallow 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.830
 nonsense that the tricks do not 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.040
 I do not know, I think that's my opinion 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.480
 but I think it 's like that there's no trick 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.620
 none nor is there anything nor is it just luck and 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.940
 buy many lottery is just your turn 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.680
 the first one is the same in the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.320
 three hundred lotteries or you'll know in 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.910
 what else do you have 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.910
 good the next question 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:31.099
 is from dj tico mister dj tico full voucher 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:34.389
 I asked myself how long I have been 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.889
 playing, I've been playing for about 4 years and 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.319
 for me a week short is not 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.029
 a game in which time passes 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.580
 flying not for me last year was 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:46.009
 when I was starting to raise the level 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.319
 my account until 61 and this year I'm 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.629
 universe 61 and two years ago it's finished 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.400
 to create the account for me here 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.620
 operating time goes by very fast 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.659
 for me it was yesterday when they introduced me 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.969
 the game and I'm already here with two accounts 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.250
 of levels from very high levels and with 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:05.000
 m-79 with everything and doing up videos of 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.699
 gameplays as a game and so on, and 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.710
 Well, no, it has cost me to get to 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.710
 where I am right now it has cost me 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.650
 I've been fighting with youtube for a year 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.930
 and a half or even more besides a year and 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.569
 medium and with the operation four years 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.389
 I've been here for 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.550
 struggling to be a good player and 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.559
 I'm still not a good player 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.129
 I still have a lot to learn from 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:32.469
 many maps and so on that is different not 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.969
 be a good player to kill a lot 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.279
 It can not be that you can kill a lot 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.479
 but in a novice channel no more and 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:40.300
 Well, I still have to learn 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.779
 not in this good game I hope not 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.039
 bore you with uploading both my videos 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.089
 not because I'm always climbing the 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.249
 same videos people tell me that 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.229
 I always upload the same videos good 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:54.099
 I'm so sorry 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.199
 kids but I got complicated with 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.939
 youtube I hope not to bore you 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.380
 I make this new country so that I do not have 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:04.390
 more problems 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.400
 I hope I do not have them, of course 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.530
 but in the end I promise you that I have a 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.320
 lot of gameplays with m-79 and others 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.960
 Languages that you will surely like 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.639
 surely very surely you like 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.780
 and well, this is all for this video 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.780
 we go to the next chao
