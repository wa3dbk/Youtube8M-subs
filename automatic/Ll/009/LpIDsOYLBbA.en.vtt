00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.279 
that does it's fun going to touch here I
think<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> did<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> know

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289

touch<00:01:09.289> is<00:01:09.500> probably<00:01:09.740> giving<00:01:09.950> him<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.130> benefit

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
touch is probably giving him the benefit

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.469

of<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.579> doubt<00:01:10.729> because<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.060> messed<00:01:11.240> up<00:01:11.359> the

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
of the doubt because you messed up the

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.359 
of the doubt because you messed up the
last<00:01:11.630> one<00:01:11.899> that's<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.590> good<00:01:12.799> piece<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.070> play

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
last one that's a good piece of play

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.770 
last one that's a good piece of play
there<00:01:13.609> just<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.000> create<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.450> extra<00:01:14.750> number

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
there just to create the extra number

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.499 
there just to create the extra number
now<00:01:17.780> let's<00:01:17.960> look<00:01:18.079> at<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.319> referee<00:01:18.710> here<00:01:19.069> too

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
now does he impact upon this is he

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.590 
now does he impact upon this is he
becoming<00:01:25.429> like<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:25.939> sixteenth<00:01:26.539> attacker

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
becoming like a sixteenth attacker

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.899

he<00:01:29.080> does<00:01:29.260> doesn't<00:01:29.619> he<00:01:29.710> does<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:30.729> he<00:01:30.790> also

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
he does doesn't he does but he also

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.670 
he does doesn't he does but he also
becomes<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.420> bit<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.689> defendant<00:01:32.020> isn't<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.470> I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
becomes a bit of a defendant isn't it I

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.560 
becomes a bit of a defendant isn't it I
thought<00:01:33.460> he<00:01:33.580> was<00:01:33.640> almost<00:01:33.820> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.180> cost<00:01:34.360> like
