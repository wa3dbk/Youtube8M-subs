00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
this stuff in public I think that even

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.930 
this stuff in public I think that even
the<00:01:01.199> so-called<00:01:01.469> cool<00:01:02.039> kids<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.760> like

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.230 
that's not cool man especially right now
when<00:01:06.450> bullying<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.680> such<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> huge<00:01:08.340> problem<00:01:08.640> why

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
when bullying is such a huge problem why

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
when bullying is such a huge problem why
are<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> feeding<00:01:09.720> into<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.530> what

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
I mean because younger people are

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
I mean because younger people are
typically<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> people<00:01:12.810> who<00:01:12.900> shop<00:01:13.140> at

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.429 
off a cool vibe in some ways that work
now<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> doesn't<00:01:33.840> work<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:33.960> me<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.380> they

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
now it doesn't work for me but they

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
now it doesn't work for me but they
don't<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> source<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.490> overweight

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
don't want me that source I'm overweight

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
don't want me that source I'm overweight
because<00:01:36.299> every<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.750> walk<00:01:37.079> by<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> store

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
because every time I walk by the store

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
because every time I walk by the store
there's<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> guy<00:01:38.130> hanging<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> shirt

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
there's a guy hanging out with a shirt

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
there's a guy hanging out with a shirt
open<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.140> no<00:01:40.290> literally

usually he's like twelve by the way

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
usually he's like twelve by the way

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
in here for several different reasons

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
in here for several different reasons
right<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> says<00:01:51.810> basically<00:01:52.049> if

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
right but but it says basically if

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
right but but it says basically if
you're<00:01:52.829> overweight<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.640> welcome

here

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
here
and<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.409> I'm<00:01:55.619> saying<00:01:55.979> look<00:01:56.219> he<00:01:56.700> crossed

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and that but I'm saying look he crossed

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
and that but I'm saying look he crossed
that<00:01:57.119> moral<00:01:57.390> line<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> long<00:01:57.810> time<00:01:58.049> ago<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that moral line a long time ago but in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.999 
that moral line a long time ago but in
terms<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> marketing<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.270> smart

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
terms of marketing and and smart

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
terms of marketing and and smart
capitalism<00:02:02.009> etcetera<00:02:02.509> he's<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.780> smart<00:02:03.869> as

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
capitalism etcetera he's not as smart as

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.050 
capitalism etcetera he's not as smart as
he<00:02:04.170> thinks<00:02:04.409> he<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> cuz<00:02:05.280> he's<00:02:05.430> crossing<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
he thinks he is cuz he's crossing that

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
he thinks he is cuz he's crossing that
line<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.320> gonna<00:02:07.500> lose<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> lot<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
line and I think is gonna lose a lot of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
line and I think is gonna lose a lot of
customers<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> turn

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
customers because that's going to turn

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350 
customers because that's going to turn
to<00:02:10.200> shopping<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> ever<00:02:11.310> Cumbrian<00:02:11.849> fish<00:02:12.060> means

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to shopping and ever Cumbrian fish means

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.699 
to shopping and ever Cumbrian fish means
you're<00:02:12.510> an<00:02:12.599> asshole<00:02:12.750> definite

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
you're an asshole definite

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.530 
you're an asshole definite
and<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.519> not<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.939> be<00:02:15.030> cool<00:02:15.239> anymore

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and so it's not going to be cool anymore

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.050 
and so it's not going to be cool anymore
so<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.469> I<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.680> think<00:02:17.159> that<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.609> know<00:02:17.730> you're

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so I look I I think that you know you're

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.679 
so I look I I think that you know you're
right

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
right

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.990 
right
but<00:02:18.900> part<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.650> wants<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> disagree<00:02:20.849> with

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
but part of me wants to disagree with

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
but part of me wants to disagree with
you<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.269> bit<00:02:21.540> because<00:02:21.659> it's<00:02:22.230> not<00:02:22.439> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you a little bit because it's not the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.319 
you a little bit because it's not the
first<00:02:22.739> time<00:02:23.010> he<00:02:23.189> made<00:02:23.340> comments<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.090> in

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
first time he made comments like this in
