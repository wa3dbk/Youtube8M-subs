 INTERVIEWER: Hello Ms. Wille, I welcome you in our photo shoot 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 for Ellen Wille's new Hair Power catalog. This year's motto is "out of the box". 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.100
 What do you think of this statement? 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.500
 WILLE: I think it's wonderful. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
 Even our wigs come out of a box. 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.000
 It is a good thing, remember that they are immediately ready to wear ... 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.600
 INTERVIEWER: Yes, but "thinking out of the box" seems a bit 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.300
 even his personal motto, no? 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.900
 Always go in search of something new ... 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.900
 WILLE: The box is a limit, a border ... I like to think of the horizon ... 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
 Sometimes I ask those around me: "but are you able to think outside the box?" 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
 And everyone answers me "Of course I do". But then, actually, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 they all stay inside their box ... 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.100
 INTERVIEWER: Is there a collection you prefer? 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.900
 Or a particular model? 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900
 WILL: Mmmm ... difficult question. I am a woman, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.900
 and every woman loves what is good for her, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 what gives it a sense of well-being. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 And I also have to "think outside the box", look beyond the horizon. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.900
 For this reason I have to like all my models ... 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 And that's just how it is! 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 INTERVIEWER: What does a wig mean to you? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 WILLE: Well, a wig allows change, it's a help for every woman, 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
 it makes her feel beautiful, graceful, attractive, fashionable. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.900
 A wig allows for beauty results 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.900
 sometimes impossible with your own hair. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 INTERVIEWER: How would you describe your team? The one now at work on the set? 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 WILLE: Oh, my team is a hard worker, very creative and brave ... 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Yes, a great team. We have an excellent working relationship 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 INTERVIEWER: How long have you been working together? 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.900
 WILLE: With the team in the studio we've been working together for 10-15 years, 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.900
 but if we also consider those who are not present at this time, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Well, we've been working together for 25-30 years 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.900
 INTERVIEWER: But how, has the Ellen Wille company existed for so long? 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 WILLE: Yes, Ellen Wille has existed for over 40 years 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800
 INTERVIEWER: Where do you get the inspiration for your collections? 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.900
 WILLE: Oh, I always walk the streets with my eyes wide open. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.900
 Since I work with wigs, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.500
 the first thing a person says is his hair cut, 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.900
 even when I browse through newspapers or magazines. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 On the plane, when I travel, I always check cuts, hairstyles and colors, 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.500
 because you always have to be ready to welcome the new trends. 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.000
 In a word: I live with my eyes wide open. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much. It was really a nice interview. 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 WILLE: Thanks to her, it was fun.
