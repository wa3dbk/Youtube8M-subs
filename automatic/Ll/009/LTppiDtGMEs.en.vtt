 Thank you, we will play yours 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.410
 big chance missed the final move in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.880
 to make ulm perfect 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 we are here with a 2 1-lead 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.360
 arrived and wanted as possible today 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.059
 already this third victory of the necessary 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.129
 is get to get to the final 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.879
 Unfortunately we did not succeed 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.460
 have found good in the lot and in 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.820
 the second half, however, the unis 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.729
 too many easy points allowed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 we did not understand it 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.830
 patient to attack the zone 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.429
 some miscarriages became too easy 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.750
 score from fast attacks and the 28th 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.920
 points when this second quarter 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 were definitely too much 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.630
 in the second half we have unfortunately 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 again worse in the lot found 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.810
 as in game 3 or parallel to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.869
 but then it came again 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.970
 understood about use and 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.000
 At the end we still want to fight 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 opportunity to win 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 and that was against all the odds it was 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.050
 a great mood in the hall 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.539
 The fans have the Ulm team very much 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.880
 Well supported by the occasion 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.640

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 what was not enough in the end we have 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 Unfortunately, he did not throw the last one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.660

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.280

 to be gaming experience as associates the one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.780
 were impressive victory among the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.340
 conditions has arisen under which 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.530
 You can only join the team for one 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.840
 great performance emotionally congratulate 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.050
 have acted at an incredibly high level 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 not us from setbacks either 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.530
 to throw back are positive 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.020
 have stayed with each other 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.390
 have supported militantly one 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.870
 Outstanding achievement made in mine 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.830
 eyes on the rebounds that the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.940
 Hammer clearly won and playful 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.180
 we also did a lot of things right 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.190
 that was a decent score of 81 points 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.670
 in regular play time is good in 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.989
 The playoffs were not perfect 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.850
 but I'm not looking for the little ones now 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.790
 error but I'm proud of that 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.870
 team we got the game five 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.880
 earned and we have been twice 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.810
 This season in Oldenburg came twice 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.810
 win there 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.670
 All good things went three 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.670
 to oldenburg to enter the final 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.670
 Thank you very much 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.410
 When asking the trainer please do that 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.060
 microphone 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.430
 they just said against everybody 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.350
 Adversity, therefore, a lot of will to use and 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.070
 then against all the adversities soon 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.330
 with all the odds that is 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.770
 it is not easy to win away 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.770
 This has been seen again today 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.919
 these 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.170
 that unfortunately the fatal 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.770
 in game one they were offensive 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.830
 Rebounds have a crucial point 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.200
 she said now has ulm 13 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.960
 You have three questions for both coaches 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.570
 it was a key one today yes 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.150
 Of course if you see where more opportunities 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.870
 gets as the opponent is natural 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.110
 an advantage 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 and we definitely have to go back 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.900
 Act better as well as what in the fourth 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.810
 have done quarter as we barely 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.700
 second week opportunities have come about 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.270
 come let a game crucial 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.070
 unfortunately by alan wake i believe it was 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.250
 his own throw was his own miss 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.940
 which he got back there it came 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.140
 then to fight for the ball was in 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.600
 my eyes clearly a step 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.690
 mistake commits 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.770
 and that came to a yes to one 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.570
 further throwing test 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.330
 and of course that hurts when you're in 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.280
 such crucial game situations 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.540
 is not creating this defensive 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.540
 to get rebounds 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:53.210
 we have a good day today 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.419
 three-point line thrown 39 points 39 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.199
 percent from there threw the 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.330
 opponents even at 32 percent even on 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:05.389
 but have received the three-dot line 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.400
 not well defended near the basket and 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.860
 There they have a good 75 percent 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.449
 can achieve a hit rate of 48 percent 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.120
 Overall if you look ours 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.490
 hit rate looks at the total 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.440
 only at 41 percent then that would have 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.360
 actually suggest the conclusion 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.169
 the opponent will win like sebastian 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.240
 yes already said 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.919
 It has the decisive advantage 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.750
 that brought us very many 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.419
 had offensive rebounds and thus nine 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.500
 chances to have more and then it is 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.699
 then the slightly worse 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.699
 hit ratio is not that crucial 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.820
 more questions the two coaches 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.939
 because many thanks for the attention 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.939
 in good due to home
