 dad here is advertising on 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.200

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.680
 which should be active by hand 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.879
 quickly 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.269
 in fact we turn off the machine problem 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:00.780
 if you shut down windows ten perfect 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.230
 we find ourselves again putting it on the screen 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.230
 full 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.800
 and could do to all 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.800
 Possible and imaginable updates 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.160
 stola on the perfect problems 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.620
 but that we enter full screen mode 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.330
 but in part ii we will see how 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.570
 optimize windows 10 because after a while 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.850
 of time starts to slow down too or use 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.280
 too many resources the hard disk in fact vi 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:59.550
 I show at start up resource waves 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:03.110
 was using ok because it does not become 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.110
 full morning screen 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.800
 ok perfect perfect time has passed 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.600
 in fact, if we go up here, in fact, already 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.110
 the updates are ready to be 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.820
 installed we can already customize it 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.810
 that before these functions were 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.970
 totally blocked as you can see we can 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:36.449
 take the background now we can 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.090
 put the lockscreen we can change 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:46.610

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:06.270

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.270
 desktop computer as local disks 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:20.010
