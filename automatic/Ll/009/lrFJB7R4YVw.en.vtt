00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.190
 as promised now continue like that videos 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.600
 on the subject of ketogenic feeding and nutrition 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.280
 generally for my diet 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.329
 I could have it all a bit 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.869
 I do not do that for as long as 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:14.339
 yesterday 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:16.470
 regardless liters of water a 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.720
 that is always a shake water 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 pure with 100 milliliters grabs him into 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 ice compartment in the morning I have then 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.669
 independent speed drive into the water there 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.009
 there are 250 milliliters of water in the top 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:49.469
 on it so wichmann perfect as flowers 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:51.269
 Give it to my boss every morning 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.379
 is and that means I'm starting now 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.829
 come today we make ketogenic 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.429
 between us next to it 3 125 gram pair 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.700
 player deep shape mini sausages 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.010
 four pupils all engineering ago 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.540
 fat content of about 50 grams 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 carbohydrates we are at 6 so came 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.690
 is still ok for child nutrition 40 grams 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 protein and all at 6 120 calories 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.990
 I do a bit shorter than 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.390
 last time I do the whole 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580
 preparation and film but in the process 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 fast course that's what I mean now 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 Flag after the game cancellations in the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 microwave and the rest later 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.679
 so the player heats the microwave 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.759
 I start I at first that I 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.410
 First of all, I stand like my four 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.980
 Sausage throws into the pan 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 maybe as soon as you need it 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910
 want to come 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.310
 the sausages are now light 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.489
 SautÃ©ed that they fry about 2 minutes 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 and now I give the eggs in the train 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.300
 three pieces 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.920
 the first one sees it this way 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.000
 Cars I hope you can see 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.890
 From now on it is a matter of taste, the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 means if you want that looks like 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.450
 mirror then you read that so gives the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.760
 spinach quite normal to the before 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.560
 has made the microwave warm and of 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.270
 instead all I look at it is, however, 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.560
 Relatively it does not matter if it looks like games 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.220
 or not i find it much better though 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.660
 the spinach is mixed with the mirrors 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.520
 becomes 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.790
 that means I destroy the beautiful one now 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.780
 form of fried eggs fill the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 Add spinach to the pan 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.420
 and from now on it's best not to do her well 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.490
 no fork i will do that again and again 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:28.380
 no fork for it i live it 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:30.090
 anyway as I said 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.470
 visually you can of course with that 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.840
 Making safety even better means that 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.540
 we'll get it even more beautiful 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.710
 my breakfast today is ready but what 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.790
 I ask you for the one for the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.010
 devising next days for you 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.990
 Throughout you can as I said here 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.970
 we have about 600 calories the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.600
 exact nutrition I give now 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.190
 time with 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.080
 I try in my future course 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.810
 videos a little bit crisper too 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.030
 Keep and all information with customers 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.830
 in which to insert in the description 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.210
 if yes which questions would have that 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.090
 I am happy if we subscribe 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.910

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.290
