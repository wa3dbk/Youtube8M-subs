00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 times 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.860
 Dear Colleagues, We are 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.580
 Again, you could almost say that 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.090
 season 2015 and 2016 is nearing the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.119
 beginning 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.590
 we start on sunday against the vfl 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.660
 bochum here with us in the battle arena 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.059
 with a home game and 13.30 and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 like to look at this first today 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.730
 championship game first with our 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.500
 trainer markus riel out of us the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.040
 tell things about the team 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.820
 can you please thank you for the word, yes finally 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 it starts again 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.620
 I'm looking forward to having one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.700
 home game against burg states 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.220
 the team has been very strong for five weeks 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 worked hard and hard for that 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.620
 Now finally start 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.500
 We are all looking forward to it 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.280
 highly motivated as I said it is very 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.720
 nice that we have a home game 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.920
 can start against an established 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.659
 Tradition team challenge 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 full of opponents 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.470
 and yes that 's a big deal and we 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.479
 are good cheers that we at first 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.490
 play day a good performance 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.909
 can and hopefully then in the end too 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.400
 keep the three points with us 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.680
 to the staff are so far all on board 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.360
 we made it in the five 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 weeks preparation without injuries 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.700
 to come through 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.869
 the only one is 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.610
 Lakic has his injury at the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.860
 Achilles tendon that has been around for some time 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 carries around and even more 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 has to cure 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 Do you accept this role? I think that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.330
 our captain uwe hÃ¼nemeier in front of you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.770
 week or one and a half weeks in the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.560
 newspaper very good statement 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
 we have not been normal 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 newcomers and I also think that we 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.790
 now not a normal relegated are the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.660
 I think that's very fitting 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.130
 Of course we are ambitious 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.870
 Team has the goals but there now 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.730
 to slip in a favorite role 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.490
 or anything else I find completely 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.250
 coated we have newly formed team 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.720
 and we certainly want a good one 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.660
 play successfully football 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.850
 But there is a concrete one about it 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.190
 Seasonal talk is about this 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.780
 time certainly far too far 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.510
 path 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.710
 markus how relieved you were as 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.410
 it was announced that Mr. Gregor 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.240
 Richards booking still leaves 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.970
 what do you think that's the impact 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.890
 if you start two days before that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.890
 So loses an important player 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.200
 So basically I'm a coach 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.630
 he tries his team like that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.480
 to prepare that your own team good 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.200
 prepared to go into such a game 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.150
 I do not want to say it the adversary 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
 We do not care that would be very 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.740
 arrogant and and also out of place 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.680
 but I believe that bochum is wide 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.090
 established squad and also at 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.150
 last game where I personally spot 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.820
 was against borussia dortmund is he has 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.020
 the rhetorically not started and she 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.280
 still have a very good performance 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.600
 commanded so they have quite 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.490
 alternatives in the squad 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.080
 to compensate and catch that 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.700
 can and therefore I believe that we 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.160
 to hit a very strong opponent 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.760
 become 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.930
 season tickets sale ends this evening 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.500
 current stand is 5566 against the game 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.020
 Bochum we have 11,500 two tickets 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.720
 already sold in presale 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.660
 means also that the day check with 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.080
 risky opening up will be few 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.320
 Seating stands mostly then 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.170
 on the north stand the cash registers are 90 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.270
 minutes before the game opens also the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.040
 bochumer fever the season start 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.750
 there are 1,600 tickets sold there 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.570
 so at the box office for guests 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.770
 exclusively for guests because we have the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:21.270
 fan separation have close to 100 cards then 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:24.210
 are yet to acquire are news 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.910
 that blocks b and c are non-smoking 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.520
 blocks are there we appeal of course 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.640
 also to the audience that they are 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.380
 stick to it 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.330
 because of the libori we have 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.480
 as well as the start of the season 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.610
 feverishly 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.980
 We ask for early arrival and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.390
 especially at the p &amp; r parking lot because of it 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.490
 there also shuttle buses in the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.380
 downtown to the libori fest in the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.450
 get in the right bus 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.220
 so you get there where you go 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.800
 would like to 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.450
 the order is like in the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.570
 last season and also in the years 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.610
 Before that, reduced evidence of evidence 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.160
 so they are too 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.200
 unsolicited but that has 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.720
 in the last season worked very well 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.310
 and the edition of the exclusive 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.360
 members scarves takes place on the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.130
 forecourt from 11 clock 30 instead of there will be 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.190
 do not give our sale car because 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.160
 he stands on the bonuses in front of the city hall but 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.210
 another endangers where then the 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.250
 members scarves are issued so 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.250
 There are still questions around the game 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.420
 That's not the case, thanks for that 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.420
 come and see you on sunday
