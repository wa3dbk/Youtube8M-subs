only if they rate them that at that
level<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.859> think<00:02:29.189> a<00:02:29.280> parent<00:02:29.579> should<00:02:29.640> have

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
level then I think a parent should have

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
level then I think a parent should have
to<00:02:29.849> go<00:02:29.969> in<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.389> legal<00:02:30.689> guardians<00:02:31.019> you'd<00:02:31.139> have
