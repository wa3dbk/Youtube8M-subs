00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.850 
cloud and no one under is called smog
significantly<00:04:51.389> increase<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.229> size<00:04:52.440> of<00:04:52.620> smoke

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
significantly increase the size of smoke

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.770 
significantly increase the size of smoke
allowing<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.669> affect<00:04:53.970> multiple<00:04:54.120> targets

allowing you to affect multiple targets

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.890 
allowing you to affect multiple targets
so<00:04:55.560> I'm<00:04:55.919> pretty<00:04:56.100> sure<00:04:56.220> this<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.490> like<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:56.900> smoke

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
so I'm pretty sure this is like a smoke

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.740 
so I'm pretty sure this is like a smoke

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
something so you can get more better

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.790 
something so you can get more better

don't kill them like directly with the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.140 
don't kill them like directly with the
bow<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.840> go<00:05:28.620> next<00:05:28.979> to<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.190> arrow<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:30.030> he

I<00:05:44.340> don't<00:05:44.669> really<00:05:44.789> know<00:05:45.000> what<00:05:45.150> this<00:05:45.300> means<00:05:45.990> but

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
I don't really know what this means but

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.610 
I don't really know what this means but
I<00:05:46.590> guess<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.370> can<00:05:47.789> get<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.300> better<00:05:48.690> motion

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
I guess you can get a better motion

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.409 
I guess you can get a better motion
tracker<00:05:49.889> and<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.580> can<00:05:50.729> see<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:51.000> targets

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
tracker and you can see the targets

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.450 
tracker and you can see the targets
better<00:05:51.630> because<00:05:52.260> you<00:05:52.470> targeted<00:05:53.159> them<00:05:53.310> or

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
better because you targeted them or

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.670 
better because you targeted them or
something<00:05:53.610> basically<00:05:54.570> like<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.750> fang<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.500> our

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
something basically like the fang of our

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.189 
something basically like the fang of our
you<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.849> allies<00:05:57.180> can<00:05:57.419> see<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.750> marks<00:05:57.990> ooh

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
you and the allies can see the marks ooh

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.070 
you and the allies can see the marks ooh
another<00:05:58.710> one<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:58.949> got<00:05:59.190> is<00:05:59.400> not<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.510> jump<00:06:00.900> one

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
another one I got is not the jump one

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.899 
another one I got is not the jump one
but<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.409> one<00:06:01.440> right<00:06:01.740> next<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:02.039> it<00:06:02.159> it's<00:06:02.639> called

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
but the one right next to it it's called

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.490 
but the one right next to it it's called
an<00:06:03.120> extractable<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:03.960> I'm<00:06:04.199> pretty<00:06:04.320> sure

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
an extractable that I'm pretty sure

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.620 
an extractable that I'm pretty sure
that's<00:06:04.680> how<00:06:04.860> you<00:06:04.919> say<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.220> a<00:06:05.550> portion<00:06:06.419> of

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
that's how you say it a portion of

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.920 
that's how you say it a portion of
damage<00:06:07.190> taken<00:06:08.190> by<00:06:08.430> one<00:06:08.940> feather<00:06:09.240> target<00:06:09.810> is

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
damage taken by one feather target is

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.560 
damage taken by one feather target is
passed<00:06:10.199> to<00:06:10.380> all<00:06:10.650> other<00:06:11.099> tethered<00:06:12.000> targets<00:06:12.419> so

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
passed to all other tethered targets so

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.629 
passed to all other tethered targets so
basically<00:06:12.930> if<00:06:13.200> one<00:06:13.440> person<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:13.800> tethered<00:06:14.219> all

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
basically if one person is tethered all

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.620 
basically if one person is tethered all
of<00:06:14.940> them<00:06:15.090> are<00:06:15.360> going

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
of them are going

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.780 
of them are going
be<00:06:15.690> tethered<00:06:15.930> if<00:06:16.290> your<00:06:17.160> next<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.490> that<00:06:17.610> one

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
be tethered if your next to that one

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.550 
be tethered if your next to that one
person<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.750> know<00:06:18.870> this<00:06:19.020> screenshot<00:06:19.230> i<00:06:19.440> have

everything<00:06:24.300> i'm<00:06:24.660> going<00:06:24.810> to<00:06:24.900> be<00:06:24.960> putting<00:06:25.110> a

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
everything i'm going to be putting a

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.470 
everything i'm going to be putting a
screenshot<00:06:25.530> of<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.950> old<00:06:26.130> one<00:06:26.370> here<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:26.850> you

screenshot of the old one here and you
can<00:06:27.600> compare<00:06:27.960> yourself<00:06:28.440> this<00:06:28.740> is<00:06:28.920> actually<00:06:29.340> a

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
can compare yourself this is actually a

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.560 
can compare yourself this is actually a
better<00:06:30.330> revamp<00:06:30.960> than<00:06:31.230> i<00:06:31.500> would<00:06:32.220> have<00:06:32.250> expected

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
better revamp than i would have expected

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.480 
better revamp than i would have expected
but<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:33.990> one<00:06:34.140> under<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.470> Earth's<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.310> pretty

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
but the one under the Earth's and pretty

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.290 
but the one under the Earth's and pretty
sure<00:06:35.610> those<00:06:35.790> are<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.090> daily<00:06:36.510> crucibles<00:06:36.990> or

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
sure those are the daily crucibles or

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.090 
sure those are the daily crucibles or
the<00:06:39.300> weekly<00:06:39.660> crucible<00:06:40.140> but<00:06:40.530> exercise<00:06:40.740> put

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
the weekly crucible but exercise put

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.640 
the weekly crucible but exercise put
like<00:06:41.250> a<00:06:41.280> bunch<00:06:41.550> of<00:06:41.670> texts<00:06:42.330> all<00:06:42.450> over<00:06:42.480> the<00:06:43.440> place

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
like a bunch of texts all over the place

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.640 
like a bunch of texts all over the place
to<00:06:43.920> actually<00:06:44.550> match<00:06:45.090> up<00:06:45.300> where<00:06:45.540> he<00:06:46.410> thinks

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
to actually match up where he thinks

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.690 
to actually match up where he thinks
that<00:06:47.210> where<00:06:48.210> it's<00:06:48.300> going<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.480> be<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:49.550> there<00:06:50.550> is

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
that where it's going to be and there is

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.980 
that where it's going to be and there is
Venus<00:06:51.090> Mars<00:06:51.810> Luna<00:06:52.770> is<00:06:52.890> the<00:06:53.070> moon<00:06:53.250> wreath<00:06:54.150> the

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
Venus Mars Luna is the moon wreath the

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.410 
Venus Mars Luna is the moon wreath the
events<00:06:55.410> like<00:06:55.530> iron<00:06:55.830> banner<00:06:56.180> crucible<00:06:57.180> and

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
events like iron banner crucible and

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.720 
events like iron banner crucible and
strikes<00:06:57.750> and<00:06:58.230> I<00:06:58.980> don't<00:06:59.190> know<00:06:59.310> what<00:06:59.490> the<00:06:59.580> thing

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
strikes and I don't know what the thing

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.220 
strikes and I don't know what the thing
is<00:06:59.790> on<00:07:00.030> top<00:07:00.300> like<00:07:00.660> all<00:07:00.840> the<00:07:00.960> way<00:07:01.050> on<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.140> top

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
is on top like all the way on the top

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.180 
is on top like all the way on the top
I'm<00:07:01.620> pretty<00:07:01.950> sure<00:07:02.160> that's<00:07:02.400> like<00:07:02.990> a<00:07:04.190> somewhere

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
I'm pretty sure that's like a somewhere

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.820 
I'm pretty sure that's like a somewhere
around<00:07:05.490> dreadknot<00:07:06.480> or<00:07:06.720> something<00:07:07.170> dreadknot

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
around dreadknot or something dreadknot

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.350 
around dreadknot or something dreadknot
is<00:07:08.040> the<00:07:08.430> big<00:07:08.930> cube<00:07:09.930> thing<00:07:10.310> that<00:07:11.310> Oryx<00:07:11.700> listen<00:07:12.120> I

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
is the big cube thing that Oryx listen I

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.210 
is the big cube thing that Oryx listen I
could<00:07:12.960> just<00:07:13.170> put<00:07:13.320> a<00:07:13.350> screen<00:07:13.530> shot<00:07:13.740> here<00:07:13.800> what

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
could just put a screen shot here what

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.920 
could just put a screen shot here what
it<00:07:14.310> looks<00:07:14.490> like<00:07:14.670> and<00:07:14.940> the<00:07:15.120> last<00:07:15.270> finish<00:07:15.630> out<00:07:15.780> of

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
it looks like and the last finish out of

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.800 
it looks like and the last finish out of
here<00:07:16.230> is<00:07:16.410> uh<00:07:16.440> I<00:07:17.210> don't<00:07:18.210> know<00:07:18.450> if<00:07:18.630> this<00:07:18.780> is

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
here is uh I don't know if this is

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.650 
here is uh I don't know if this is
glitched<00:07:19.260> but<00:07:19.770> there's<00:07:20.730> a<00:07:20.820> person<00:07:21.270> with<00:07:21.390> level

and another person will level 34 and I
don't<00:07:40.050> know<00:07:40.200> when<00:07:41.190> I<00:07:41.220> seen<00:07:41.970> the<00:07:42.120> live<00:07:42.300> stream

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.570 
don't know when I seen the live stream

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.810 
don't know when I seen the live stream
all<00:07:42.810> the<00:07:43.230> numbers<00:07:43.590> just<00:07:43.830> changed<00:07:43.860> it<00:07:44.220> to<00:07:44.340> 34

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820 
all the numbers just changed it to 34

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.640 
all the numbers just changed it to 34
but<00:07:45.480> I'm<00:07:45.570> pretty<00:07:45.720> sure<00:07:45.840> that's<00:07:46.110> just<00:07:46.290> a<00:07:46.410> glitch

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
but I'm pretty sure that's just a glitch

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.520 
but I'm pretty sure that's just a glitch
but<00:07:47.720> this<00:07:48.720> is<00:07:48.870> pretty<00:07:48.960> much<00:07:49.080> it<00:07:49.200> for<00:07:49.320> the<00:07:49.470> video

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530
