before because of the slight peeling of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.830 
before because of the slight peeling of
the<00:00:17.690> carbon<00:00:18.690> body<00:00:19.939> better<00:00:20.939> take<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.600> there's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the carbon body better take here there's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
the carbon body better take here there's
a<00:00:21.900> screw<00:00:22.289> missing<00:00:22.320> from<00:00:22.980> under<00:00:23.250> here<00:00:23.720> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
a screw missing from under here the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.759 
a screw missing from under here the
actual<00:00:25.730> mount<00:00:26.730> broke<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:30.510> mount<00:00:30.840> broke

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
actual mount broke the mount broke

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.069 
actual mount broke the mount broke
inside<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.700> holds<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> arm<00:00:33.510> together<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
inside that holds the arm together so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
inside that holds the arm together so
we've<00:00:34.230> taped<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.620> up<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
we've taped it up there and there and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020 
we've taped it up there and there and
also<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> back<00:00:37.309> there<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:38.790> nice

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
also over the back there so that's nice

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.470 
also over the back there so that's nice
and<00:00:39.300> strong<00:00:40.100> got<00:00:41.100> tape<00:00:41.399> wrapped<00:00:41.760> around<00:00:41.879> here

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and strong got tape wrapped around here

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.830 
and strong got tape wrapped around here
this<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:44.520> only<00:00:44.700> broke<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> bottom<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this way it only broke on the bottom of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.340 
this way it only broke on the bottom of
the<00:00:45.960> body<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:47.070> arm<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> we've<00:00:49.079> taped

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the body not the top arm so we've taped

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.090 
the body not the top arm so we've taped
it<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:50.030> under<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.710> around<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> back

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it here under here and around the back

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
it here under here and around the back
and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> cable<00:00:54.600> tie<00:00:54.780> around<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.320> which

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and I put a cable tie around it which

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
and I put a cable tie around it which
has<00:00:55.680> made<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.660> firm<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:58.260> no

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
has made it very firm there's no

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
has made it very firm there's no
movement<00:00:59.329> laterally<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.600> horizontally<00:01:01.230> there

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
movement laterally or horizontally there

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420 
movement laterally or horizontally there
at<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> appears<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> quite<00:01:04.110> strong<00:01:04.559> now

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
at all so appears to be quite strong now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700 
at all so appears to be quite strong now
we<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.729> broke<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> leg

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.960 

look<00:01:09.100> at<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.400> good<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:09.790> new<00:01:10.030> I've<00:01:10.780> actually

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
look at that good as new I've actually

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.620 
look at that good as new I've actually
remanufactured<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.409> bit<00:01:14.650> here<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.790> bit

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
remanufactured just this bit here a bit

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.719 
remanufactured just this bit here a bit
of<00:01:16.720> aluminium<00:01:17.010> just<00:01:18.010> happened<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.340> have<00:01:18.460> some

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
of aluminium just happened to have some

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.340 
of aluminium just happened to have some
line<00:01:18.970> around<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.420> house<00:01:19.659> same<00:01:20.020> diameter

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
line around the house same diameter

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.670 
line around the house same diameter
sprayed<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> black<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.790> can't<00:01:22.030> even<00:01:22.180> tell<00:01:22.680> it's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
sprayed a black you can't even tell it's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.870 
sprayed a black you can't even tell it's
not<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:24.310> much<00:01:24.340> heavier<00:01:25.000> than<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.670> than<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
not that much heavier than the than the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.560 
not that much heavier than the than the
original<00:01:28.409> broken<00:01:29.409> part<00:01:29.710> which<00:01:30.220> was<00:01:30.570> snapped

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
original broken part which was snapped

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.430 
original broken part which was snapped
off<00:01:32.070> sort<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.159> in<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.399> middle<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:34.440> so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
off sort of in the middle there so

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.130 
off sort of in the middle there so
that's<00:01:35.649> all<00:01:35.890> tightened<00:01:36.310> up<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:37.540> did<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.899> leg

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
that's all tightened up we did this leg

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.370 
that's all tightened up we did this leg
here<00:01:38.170> was<00:01:38.590> broken<00:01:39.040> off<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.909> top<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
here was broken off up the top here so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.620 
here was broken off up the top here so
all<00:01:41.560> I've<00:01:41.740> done<00:01:41.979> basically<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.880> taken<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.420> bid

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
all I've done basically is taken the bid

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.290 
all I've done basically is taken the bid
out<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:44.200> was<00:01:44.350> broken<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.039> put<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.820> leg<00:01:46.000> back

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
out that was broken and put the leg back

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.749 
out that was broken and put the leg back
up<00:01:46.720> into<00:01:47.110> their<00:01:47.440> tight<00:01:48.250> screws<00:01:49.289> and<00:01:50.759> we're

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
up into their tight screws and we're

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.340 
up into their tight screws and we're
back<00:01:51.910> in<00:01:51.970> business<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.369> gimbal<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.960> gimbal

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
back in business the gimbal the gimbal

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.320 
back in business the gimbal the gimbal
was<00:01:56.560> malfunctioning<00:01:57.250> which<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:58.000> off<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.179> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
was malfunctioning which is off of the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.830 
was malfunctioning which is off of the
loaner<00:01:59.220> but<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.250> by<00:02:00.909> taking<00:02:01.509> off<00:02:03.750> pulling<00:02:04.750> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
loaner but I by taking off pulling it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.680 
loaner but I by taking off pulling it
apart<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.460> taking<00:02:06.460> off<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:09.399> there<00:02:10.239> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
apart and taking off the in there the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.550 
apart and taking off the in there the
top<00:02:12.090> controller<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:13.720> reassembling<00:02:14.410> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
top controller and then reassembling it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.970 
top controller and then reassembling it
again<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.480> also<00:02:16.480> unscrewing<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.440> weight<00:02:17.739> on

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
again and also unscrewing the weight on

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.100 
again and also unscrewing the weight on
the<00:02:18.070> side<00:02:18.489> because<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.420> still<00:02:19.780> slightly

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the side because it is still slightly

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.330 
the side because it is still slightly
bent<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.700> way<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.260> right<00:02:23.890> hand<00:02:24.190> side

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
bent that way on the right hand side

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.590 
bent that way on the right hand side
there<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.980> actually<00:02:27.280> sitting<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:28.239> level

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
there it's actually sitting pretty level

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.620 
there it's actually sitting pretty level
and<00:02:28.870> performs<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.829> well<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.640> no<00:02:31.269> problems

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
and performs really well so no problems

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.150 
and performs really well so no problems
with<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.840> gimbal<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> expensive

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
with the gimbal that was the expensive
