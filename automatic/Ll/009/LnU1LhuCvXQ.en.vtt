 Ne 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.770
 Let's make tofu easily using microwave oven today 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.490
 Dairo , but it is soy milk 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:27.070
 And here is the source material, but plum 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:31.010
 It is a mixture of noodles and water with white white sugar, and a large leaf and white sesame seeds. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 Be sure to keep soy milk at room temperature 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.300
 And it is nice to measure correctly 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.300
 First put the ball into the ball 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 And I will put a bite 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.110
 So please mix gently about 10 times 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.060
 It's mixed up 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.060
 I will pour into this cup 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 I will cook this with a microwave after that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.409
 In this way, when putting it in the microwave oven, it is necessary to shift 2 a little so that steam does not stay inside 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.259
 It is a point 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:31.040
 If you do not do that, the steam will stagnate inside and the high pressure will be applied and the pong and lid will open 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:34.040
 Because there are times when it ends, the point where you shift this lid a little is the point 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.430
 The will continue to Chin 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.430
 Pom 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:48.930
 Because we stood 3 minutes in this state warmth now 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:53.400
 It is delicious to eat, but it can be stored in the refrigerator without 3 laps with a lid 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 I would like to make a source 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:05.060
 First of all, umeboshi was beaten and taken the bill, and it was the tax-free water divided . 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.060
 I put this umeboshi to this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.270
 Because huge girl stars and benz were mixed 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 Adjust the taste with a pinch of sugar 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.670
 Now that the source is ready 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.870
 I want to see the trash grandmother treat size 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.390
 The treat is easy to cut when the cook 6 is rolled 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.390
 I will continue to shred it from chopsticks 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:46.600
 If you do, Ohba is relatively strong, so let's release it here by doing so 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.600
 And an anti-crisp to also take open 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.360
 There is 30 minutes of chilled tofu, so I would like to serve it here and finish it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.240
 Because do so over you Yes alone in water without growth in cell and taste from taking water 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.220
 You can eat deliciously 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.220
 Let's decorate with sesame seeds at the end 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.750
 This is the completion of handmade tofu
