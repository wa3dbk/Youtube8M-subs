 because the origin instead of the country 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.120
 an increase of 6 7% the production in poissy 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.560
 but to start a tire house 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.290
 we tried to under 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.830
 to restart this panat production survey the recipes 8

 today it pays with the same attention to the age of soil 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 to fertilizer distribution to liverpool copper-based treatment 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.480
 to irrigation the scorching summer months and of course 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 at the fruiting size 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.740
 this operation is usually done during the months of March and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.310

 the bottom 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.200
 this size favors the taking of new branches which in turn 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 will become fruitful 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.200
