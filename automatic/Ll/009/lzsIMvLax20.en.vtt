00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.710
 well let's calculate 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.720
 a decimal number to convert it to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 Hexadecimal binary with calculator 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.670
 those who have a little knowledge 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.670
 of this you will know that these numbers 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.850
 you can get this number system 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.160
 You can take out putting on the table 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.690
 dividing the number by 16 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 and in various ways the calculator 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.129
 this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.430
 it can be done in a faster way 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:40.270
 this whole thing can not happen from binary 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.770
 to decimal over the tenth to the d 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.829
 of all the commissions that can be 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.460
 here also can current system 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.030
 but let's see these three ok I already 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.070
 I made 1992 to the binary number this number 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 and this number to hexadecimal system 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.400
 and with the calculator we can do what 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.970
 same 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.970
 okay 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 okay 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.880
 to enter that mode 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.770
 to be able to do that operation we put 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.930
 in mode set 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.510
 there is said base in option 4 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 ok tells us decimal we have to put the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.180
 decimal number 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.060
 the number is decimal the total number 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.049
 who is coming 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.049
 you get to see 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.850
 and they say 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.840
 the simm alexa decimal binary doctor ok 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.840
 we put 1992 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 1992 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.810
 we do not care 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.040
 then nothing else the only thing we're going to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.720
 do to turn it is to press on that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.970
 we want it already we have it with decimals 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.280
 and will do us anything we want a 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.270
 exempt binary and we check is fine 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 says that the ordinary number will be 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:25.810
 5 about 20 thousand and I got 5 about 20 emails 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 ok and then we want it to hexadecimal 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.530
 there are necessary good here came out on 7 c 8 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.530
 and here is the same 70 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.450
 equal the octave 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.940
 salt of 3,710 but it is abnormal and if this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.690
 It can be done with any quantity 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.690
 but there are exceptions 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.430
 apparently there is an error when you give 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.120
 a less amount 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.360
 and so much 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.540
 and apart you can not transform figures 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.989
 decimals is to say for example if in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.380
 1900 was a point 80 that's not 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:15.030
 can not accept the calculator 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.030
 ok well that's been goodbye
