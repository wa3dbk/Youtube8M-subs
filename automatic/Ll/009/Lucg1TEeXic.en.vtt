alright so what you see here is our
smoke<00:00:21.119> path<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.600> gonna<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.990> this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
smoke path is gonna do this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.080 
smoke path is gonna do this
our<00:00:22.859> smokes<00:00:23.250> coming<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> reactor

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
our smokes coming out of the reactor

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.599 
our smokes coming out of the reactor
into<00:00:24.689> our<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.199> cyclone<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.490> gonna

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
into our first cyclone here it's gonna

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.580 
into our first cyclone here it's gonna
drop<00:00:26.910> down<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:28.019> gonna<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.320> into<00:00:28.560> our

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
drop down it's gonna go into our

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
drop down it's gonna go into our
internal<00:00:29.220> pipe<00:00:29.580> come<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> pipe

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.590 
internal pipe come up out of this pipe
right<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.160> into<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> center<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.480> our

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
right here into the center of our

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240 
right here into the center of our
hot-water<00:00:33.870> heater<00:00:34.440> tank<00:00:34.770> I'm<00:00:34.980> gonna<00:00:35.100> try<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
hot-water heater tank I'm gonna try to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.150 
hot-water heater tank I'm gonna try to
block<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.940> wind<00:00:36.180> folks<00:00:36.860> indoor<00:00:37.860> hot

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
one here what's gonna happen inside of

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
one here what's gonna happen inside of
this<00:00:47.100> catalyst<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.789> also<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.180> getting<00:00:48.270> very

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this catalyst and also it's getting very

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.139 
this catalyst and also it's getting very
very<00:00:48.719> cold<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> liquids

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
very cold in here is a lot of liquids

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
very cold in here is a lot of liquids
gonna<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> pouring<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.500> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
gonna be pouring down out of that this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
gonna be pouring down out of that this
narrow<00:00:53.489> reservoir<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.600> narrow<00:00:54.899> area

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
narrow reservoir here this narrow area

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.849 
narrow reservoir here this narrow area
it's<00:00:55.620> wide<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.629> narrow<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:58.020> gonna<00:00:58.500> allow<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's wide but narrow is gonna allow the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
it's wide but narrow is gonna allow the
smoke<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> liquid<00:01:00.300> being<00:01:00.510> created<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
smoke in the liquid being created to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.319 
smoke in the liquid being created to
come<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.129> close<00:01:02.430> contact<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:03.090> each

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
come in very close contact with each

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
come in very close contact with each
other<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.320> gonna<00:01:04.799> help<00:01:05.100> cool

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
other which is really gonna help cool

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
other which is really gonna help cool
our<00:01:05.670> smoke<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.180> even<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:07.020> slightly

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
our smoke down even more a slightly

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
our smoke down even more a slightly
sloped<00:01:08.340> downhill<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> smokes<00:01:09.930> gonna

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sloped downhill so all the smokes gonna

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
sloped downhill so all the smokes gonna
come<00:01:10.380> through<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> narrow<00:01:11.010> area<00:01:11.549> dropped

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
come through this narrow area dropped

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.390 
come through this narrow area dropped
straight<00:01:12.299> down<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.810> 6-inch<00:01:13.320> pipe<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
straight down the 6-inch pipe all the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.200 
straight down the 6-inch pipe all the
way<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:16.520> there<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lower

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
way back down to about there are a lower

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
way back down to about there are a lower
crude<00:01:18.659> catch<00:01:18.960> tank<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.189> gonna<00:01:20.310> go

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
crude catch tank and then it's gonna go

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
crude catch tank and then it's gonna go
up<00:01:20.729> into<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.299> center<00:01:21.659> pipe<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
up into the center pipe which is also a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
up into the center pipe which is also a
catalyst<00:01:23.610> pipe<00:01:23.850> another<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> metal

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
catalyst pipe another kind of metal

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.660 
catalyst pipe another kind of metal
that's<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.049> catalyst<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.680> synthetic<00:01:26.130> gas<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that's a catalyst with synthetic gas and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
that's a catalyst with synthetic gas and
this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.770> gonna

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this is it right here so it's not gonna

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310 
this is it right here so it's not gonna
have<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.520> way<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.689> into

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
have to go all the way down back up into

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
have to go all the way down back up into
this<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.460> first<00:01:32.729> radiator<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.659> there's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this into our first radiator so there's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
this into our first radiator so there's
all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.650> gas<00:01:34.829> entering<00:01:35.460> into<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.759> first

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
all the gas entering into our first

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.710 
all the gas entering into our first
radiator<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> our<00:01:38.820> first

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
radiator right there so out of our first

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.679 
radiator right there so out of our first
cyclone<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.070> heavy<00:01:41.340> crude<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.540> ash

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
cyclone here the heavy crude and the ash

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
cyclone here the heavy crude and the ash
is<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.409> drop<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.220> lower<00:01:44.520> pipe

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is now gonna drop out of this lower pipe

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
is now gonna drop out of this lower pipe
right<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:46.140> into<00:01:46.530> also<00:01:46.710> into<00:01:47.520> our

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
right here and down into also into our

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
right here and down into also into our
crude<00:01:47.939> catch<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.689> pipe<00:01:48.960> goes<00:01:49.200> almost

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
crude catch and that pipe goes almost

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
crude catch and that pipe goes almost
all<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> bottom<00:01:50.549> here<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
all the way down to the bottom here you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.810 
all the way down to the bottom here you
see<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> already<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:53.130> spout<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> need

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
see I already put in a out spout I need

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.910 
see I already put in a out spout I need
to<00:01:53.880> put<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> plug<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.560> run

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
to put a plug in there so we can now run

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190 
to put a plug in there so we can now run
all<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> heavy<00:01:56.640> crude<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.540> back

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
all that heavy crude if we want back

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.280 
all that heavy crude if we want back
into<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> ash<00:01:58.799> supply<00:01:59.340> into<00:01:59.700> our<00:01:59.880> heavy<00:02:00.390> ash

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
into the ash supply into our heavy ash

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
into the ash supply into our heavy ash
supply<00:02:01.829> inside<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.340> our<00:02:02.520> reactor<00:02:03.030> tank<00:02:03.299> here

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
supply inside of our reactor tank here

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
supply inside of our reactor tank here
which<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.320> actually<00:02:04.530> help<00:02:04.740> bind<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.490> lot<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
which will actually help bind a lot of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.700 
which will actually help bind a lot of
that<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> fact<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.079> heat<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.530> there

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that up and in fact the heat in there

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770 
that up and in fact the heat in there
will<00:02:07.860> reactivate<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.640> lot<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> produce

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
will reactivate a lot of that produce

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.260 
will reactivate a lot of that produce
smoke<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.950> actually<00:02:11.099> use<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
smoke from it we can actually use so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
smoke from it we can actually use so
this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.930> our

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this is our

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
this is our
holding<00:02:13.860> tank<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.610> crude<00:02:14.940> our

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
holding tank for all that crude our

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.420 
holding tank for all that crude our
first<00:02:15.510> primary<00:02:15.750> big<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.950> that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
first primary big one here and that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.740 
first primary big one here and that
system<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.970> actually<00:02:18.090> gonna<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.600> run

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
system is actually gonna have to run

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.120 
system is actually gonna have to run
through<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> few<00:02:19.170> different<00:02:19.440> times<00:02:19.890> like

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
through it a few different times like

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.070 
through it a few different times like
you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.370> see<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.120> anyways<00:02:21.780> I'm<00:02:21.959> going

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you can see there in anyways I'm going

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
you can see there in anyways I'm going
to<00:02:22.140> finish<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.500> radiator<00:02:22.920> top<00:02:23.280> right<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.730> here

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
to finish the radiator top right up here

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.150 
to finish the radiator top right up here
it's<00:02:24.360> gonna<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> pancake<00:02:25.230> flat<00:02:25.530> radiator

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
it's gonna be a pancake flat radiator

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's gonna be a pancake flat radiator
and<00:02:26.640> that's<00:02:26.940> gonna<00:02:27.090> help<00:02:27.330> cycle<00:02:27.930> our<00:02:28.080> cool

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
and that's gonna help cycle our cool

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.440 
and that's gonna help cycle our cool
water<00:02:28.740> through<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.160> we're<00:02:29.819> gonna<00:02:29.940> put<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> fan

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
water through here we're gonna put a fan

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.410 
water through here we're gonna put a fan
up<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.870> top<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.380> for<00:02:31.680> traffic<00:02:32.420> driving

zinc copper and aluminum are gonna

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.620 
zinc copper and aluminum are gonna
definitely<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.489> good<00:03:11.700> job<00:03:11.760> dropping<00:03:12.480> out<00:03:12.600> a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
definitely do a good job dropping out a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.570 
definitely do a good job dropping out a
lot<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.200> liquids<00:03:13.620> out<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.920> your<00:03:14.069> smoke

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
lot of the liquids out of your smoke

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.860 
lot of the liquids out of your smoke
that<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.910> don't<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.480> into<00:03:15.750> your
