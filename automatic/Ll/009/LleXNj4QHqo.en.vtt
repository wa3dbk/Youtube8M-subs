00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.400
 medium valentine on the particular page 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:12.900
 if it helps out that allows you to avoid to 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.909
 treat the taxi driver tgp against the dictated 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.909
 against disk nylon 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.600
 I'm going to start by putting a little bit of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.820
 white illuminator on all my eyelids 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.860
 and then the truth to me was my hand 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.439
 with a little bit more than enough 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.420
 for both of us, but we're going to 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.380
 put so that the colors of the shadow 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 highlight much more 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.480
 and now with a brush to blur 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.820
 very light coffee color we are going to put 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.420
 as the first transition color in everything 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.420
 fold 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.910
 Y 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.800
 then I will take a fuchsia color with the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.750
 same brush and I'll put it as 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.790
 second transition color is to say that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 we are going to mix it blending with 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.750
 the previous color 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.100
 now with a very strong purple color and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.530
 an angular brush let's take a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.509
 little to go marking the basin 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.700
 the idea is to draw it and that is how 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.530
 marked because that is the effect that 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.689
 we want to give a different effect if 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.039
 you do not like this then what 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.079
 can do with the same brush 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.659
 blur and then they will mix it in 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.100
 all colors and good if you want it 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.869
 leave so then what we are going to do 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.720
 is with that same 15 trying to carry 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.539
 the color a little bit up and now 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.390
 with a flat brush and a pink color 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.560
 clarito is going to put it on my entire eyelid 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.560
 mobile to taps 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 then good new brush I will take 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.080
 this color purple in purple to put it 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.270
 over also and give as more color to 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.920
 our mobile eyelid and we're going to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 take a little towards our lacrimal 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.030
 and with a very white powder we're going to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.670
 put the eyebrow business to 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 light up here let's touch up a little 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 the purple color 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.580
 and then putting on a little bit of black 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.580
 to give it more depth 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.450
 the following delineate our eyes from 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 what will he do with this day two liquids 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.390
 to be more than I love and good as 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.550
 depending on our points I'm going 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.319
 to be faithful area but if you already 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.319
 decide how the little tail has 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.890
 and the tape is going to help them a lot 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.000
 very much that the outline is left 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.000
 good perfect 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.100
 now I'm going to fix my eyebrows because it 's 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.440
 super important that the lady is very 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 very very neat for when we take 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.540
 makeups as strong as this 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.000
 we continue removing the tapes 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.110
 and then with a little bit and a little 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.520
 Make-up remover water at the end of 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.740
 give the finishes because we have left if 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.460
 well perfect our delineated if this 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.460
 it happened to us 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.310
 and now let's put the opponent also 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.430
 I am using you serve first 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.010
 I'm putting on the wall tests on a 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.910
 good as the first of lashes that is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.489
 a transparent gel and then to put the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.230
 mascara and the truth that they are super super 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.349
 I recommend them very long 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.349
 girls 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.189
 and I'm sticking a few eyelashes justices 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.719
 a little bit long and dramatic but 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.420
 good as I always tell you this is 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.220
 optional 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.470
 let's put a little bit of white on the 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.960
 water ring and then a pink color 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.590
 so that our look looks like this more 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.020
 in the other eyes because bigger and 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.870
 then with a purple color the same as 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.130
 we put earlier let's put in 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.130
 our lower eyelid 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.320
 and for all this it makes it bigger 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.960
 to use this in tube correctors and 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.729
 I'm going to put the whitest possible 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.190
 and we are going to create them both to put 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.539
 in lighting points as they are in the 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.590
 women making a triangle in the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.139
 nose 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.100
 worried and on the chin and I'm going to 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.100
 combine very well 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.820
 I'm going to put a little bit of compact powder 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.610
 over because I have not put the base 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.780
 and now with this bronzer I'm going to put 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.450
 some places like our nose 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.080
 on the cheekbones to do a little bit of 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.080
 contour 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.890
 I can use this blush people one of 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.040
 extra illuminator then I love 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.200
 because it leaves my skin super pretty and 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.060
 like lipstick I'm going to use this one 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.220
 revlon that is by adif and it seems to me that 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.200
 is super super good for makeup 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.630
 fusion can put a little rose also if 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.360
 they want me over I'm putting this 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.350
 Maybelline lipstick I love how 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.690
 the effect remains 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.550
 and well that's the final result I hope 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.930
 that you liked this makeup and 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.930
