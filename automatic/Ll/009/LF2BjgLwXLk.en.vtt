that<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> checked<00:00:29.730> pretty<00:00:29.970> much<00:00:30.150> every<00:00:30.510> time<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that I checked pretty much every time I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
that I checked pretty much every time I
got<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> track<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.009> takes<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> few

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
got on the track it only takes a few

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.170 
got on the track it only takes a few
seconds<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.219> low<00:00:35.579> C<00:00:35.760> Ryan<00:00:35.969> I've

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
seconds to do I use my low C Ryan I've

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.270 
seconds to do I use my low C Ryan I've
gave<00:00:36.559> basically<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.710> I'll<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> I'll<00:00:38.250> just

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
gave basically what I'll do is I'll just

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
gave basically what I'll do is I'll just
take<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> vehicle<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> full<00:00:40.170> tank<00:00:40.410> of

fuel generally with a body and
everything<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.440> pick<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> vehicle

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
everything on and just pick the vehicle

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
everything on and just pick the vehicle
up<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> drop<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.149> four<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> six<00:00:45.719> inches

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
up and drop it from four to six inches

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.970 
up and drop it from four to six inches
off<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> ground<00:00:47.899> set<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.050> ride<00:00:49.260> i've<00:00:49.410> gauge<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
off the ground set my ride i've gauge to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.850 
off the ground set my ride i've gauge to
twenty<00:00:50.280> nine<00:00:50.309> millimeters<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:52.530> slide

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
twenty nine millimeters and just slide

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.790 
twenty nine millimeters and just slide
it<00:00:53.070> under<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> car<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
it under the back of the car here and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
it under the back of the car here and
this<00:00:55.800> gauge<00:00:56.039> should<00:00:56.399> slide<00:00:57.210> under<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> tip<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this gauge should slide under the tip of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.979 
this gauge should slide under the tip of
the<00:00:58.230> chassis<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> fit<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.809> nice

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the chassis and and fit really nice

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
the chassis and and fit really nice
right<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.410> between<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> chest<00:01:01.980> yeah<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.850> car

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
right in between the chest yeah the car

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
right in between the chest yeah the car
is<00:01:03.180> too<00:01:03.390> low<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.559> gauge<00:01:04.739> hits<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is too low and the gauge hits it and it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
is too low and the gauge hits it and it
bumps<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> car<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
bumps up the back of the car then you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.539 
bumps up the back of the car then you
know<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> need<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> adjust<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.430> more

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
know you need to adjust and put more

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
know you need to adjust and put more
preload<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> springs<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.530> there's<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
preload on the springs or if there's a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.429 
preload on the springs or if there's a
big<00:01:11.070> gap<00:01:11.400> between<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.970> tip<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> gauge<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
big gap between the tip of the gauge and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.679 
big gap between the tip of the gauge and
the<00:01:13.650> chassis<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.460> too<00:01:14.729> high<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.420> you'll<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the chassis it's too high so you'll have

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.380 
the chassis it's too high so you'll have
to<00:01:15.900> lower<00:01:16.340> by<00:01:17.340> decreasing<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> amount<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to lower by decreasing the amount of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
to lower by decreasing the amount of
spring<00:01:18.990> tension<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> front<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
spring tension and then for the front of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.219 
spring tension and then for the front of
the<00:01:21.240> car<00:01:21.680> we<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.710> turn<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> around<00:01:23.310> here

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the car we just turn it around here

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.600 
the car we just turn it around here
adjust<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.409> gauge<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.890> twenty<00:01:26.189> seven

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
adjust our gauge to twenty seven

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
adjust our gauge to twenty seven
millimeters<00:01:27.259> again<00:01:28.259> dropping<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> car<00:01:29.100> from

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
millimeters again dropping the car from

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.510 
millimeters again dropping the car from
four<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> six<00:01:29.970> inches<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> sliding<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> gauge

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
four to six inches and sliding the gauge

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.149 
four to six inches and sliding the gauge
under<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> front<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> car<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.950> want

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
under the front of the car and you want

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
under the front of the car and you want
to<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.340> basically<00:01:35.729> directly<00:01:36.570> under<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to go basically directly under the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
to go basically directly under the
droops<00:01:37.380> through<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.829> car<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
droops through the car so right at the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.700 
droops through the car so right at the
lowest<00:01:39.210> point<00:01:39.479> where<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> chassis<00:01:40.229> starts<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lowest point where the chassis starts to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.649 
lowest point where the chassis starts to
bend<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.850> again<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> rear<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
bend up and again for the rear of the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.590 
bend up and again for the rear of the
buggy<00:01:42.869> 29<00:01:43.439> millimeters<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> front<00:01:44.850> 27

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
buggy 29 millimeters for the front 27

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.889 
buggy 29 millimeters for the front 27
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> eighty<00:01:46.770> 2.0<00:01:47.899> 42

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and then for the eighty 2.0 42
