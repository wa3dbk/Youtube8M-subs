00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.420
 sure many of you have 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.940
 heard about image counseling 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 but you do not know what good is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.330
 Well do not worry because today I'm going to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 experience it with white welcome 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.809
 Mary, let's do the first 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
 experience with you so that all 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 learn very well and understand what 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 consists of an image advice 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.279
 valid sit back and watch and let's start 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.010
 the color analysis is worth the test 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.470
 color consists of doing 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 and comparison of colored handkerchiefs 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 to see with that color that you will make 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.880
 look in the mirror and anyone when 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 we do find that those who 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.180
 they seem to favor us more they disguise 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 the expression lines of the face 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 wrinkles then soften more I 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 I always start by trying black and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.379
 brown are two colors one very cold and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.190
 another very warm you maria have a complexion 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 very pale black hair and eyes 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.110
 brown and large that already influences a lot 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.840
 to know a little about the harmony of each 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.420
 One with the black I see you very pretty in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.640
 the brown ones that look bad but 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.270
 Of course if we compare it again 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.270
 with the black 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
 comes the black 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.180
 the fuchsia is a color 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.250
 very strong in baby albos and you use it if 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.860
 now I do it with the orange you're going to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 check that the difference is huge 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.630
 for thee orange much they 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.170
 take this season and name the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 ordinary because it is a color that you just 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.289
 highlight you are much prettier with the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.630
 pink we see everyone is much prettier 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.509
 with the rose that with the orange the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.830
 orange turns you off it looks good in the pink 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.880
 it does not have you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 exactly the blue klein 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.439
 is another safe bet however if you 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.950
 I put myself 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.080
 a kind of mustard you see you are 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.209
 winter because the colors go to you 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.540
 very vivid in an intense red 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.390
 valentino for example that you see is a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.209
 red that have bluish tints that do not 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.050
 it's with orange tints in bluish you're 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.290
 gorgeous you need the pure color the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.709
 blacks whites blue klein el 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.720
 purple the red the green bottle all 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.620
 those with more blue ingredients 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.540
 that your colors are yellow 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.940
 Well, look, Maria, I'm going to determine you with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.090
 the measurement of the clubs what is your 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.130
 silhouette you have balanced harmony in the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.290
 top and bottom 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 therefore I believe at first sight that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.810
 you are hourglass silhouette you have 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.850
 much marked waist you have good chest 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.040
 and you need a bit of prominence in 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.299
 shoulders 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.040
 a little bit we have already seen the study of 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.500
 color also the morphological study 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.090
 white you have to apply everything all this 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.099
 you told me to reality you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.780
 would you recommend a color 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.799
 a dress with a very good color very 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.540
 strong 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.030
 you are hourglass silhouette you can 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.010
 allow everything but I said 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.500
 would enter a bit asymmetric as 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.989
 we had seen to raise a little the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 part of here from the shoulder and something marking 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.200
 good waist 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.049
 I like asymmetric, I like it very much 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.769
 this assimilate when one has a tissue 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.510
 a beautiful one of a small scope with 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.700
 much prominence in the shoulder that you 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.210
 you need that you need and you're going to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.180
 give a lot of his life 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.240
 I can wear a headdress on my head 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.060
 touched you can defend some flowers 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.160
 very striking flowers of this kind is not 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.050
 excessive 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.540

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.110
 to risk and to propose look 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.120
 this red toilet of your red valentino 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.010

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.380
 make the boyfriend trucks better than not 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.390

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.000
 protagonism to the bride that not with the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.950
 goya this should not be done but if you
