00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
the larger levels which is pretty

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
heavily based on platforming it's

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.740 
heavily based on platforming it's
actually<00:01:36.520> more<00:01:36.700> fun<00:01:36.910> when<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.150> play<00:01:37.300> as<00:01:37.510> co-op

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.390 
actually more fun when you play as co-op
but<00:01:38.080> every<00:01:38.350> level<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.680> also<00:01:38.950> playable

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
but every level is also playable

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.680 
but every level is also playable
single-player<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.180> that's<00:01:40.360> kind<00:01:40.540> of<00:01:40.570> really

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
single-player and that's kind of really

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.600 
single-player and that's kind of really
importantly<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.920> play<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.460> your

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
importantly you can play this on your

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.950 
importantly you can play this on your
own<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.090> play<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.300> with<00:01:43.390> friends<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.869> the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
own you can play it with friends on the

same PlayStation and also play online
and<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.720> next<00:01:47.050> section<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.470> first

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
and this next section is the first

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.800 
and this next section is the first
introduction<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.400> danger<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:48.940> see<00:01:49.660> that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
introduction of danger so see that

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.840 
introduction of danger so see that
little<00:01:49.960> smoking<00:01:50.410> thing<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.520> don't<00:01:51.610> want<00:01:51.790> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
little smoking thing you don't want to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.570 
little smoking thing you don't want to
touch<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:53.229> really<00:01:53.740> adds<00:01:53.860> an<00:01:54.340> extra

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
touch it and that really adds an extra

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.790 
touch it and that really adds an extra
dimension<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:55.149> gameplay<00:01:55.540> also<00:01:56.410> you<00:01:56.470> see<00:01:56.680> these

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
dimension to gameplay also you see these

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.380 
dimension to gameplay also you see these
little<00:01:57.040> kind<00:01:57.130> of<00:01:57.220> microchips<00:01:57.910> which<00:01:58.149> are<00:01:58.300> on

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
little kind of microchips which are on

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.359 
little kind of microchips which are on
the<00:01:58.479> wall<00:01:58.630> that's<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.590> way<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.890> you<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.160> add

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the wall that's a way that you can add

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.730 
the wall that's a way that you can add
logic<00:02:00.729> into<00:02:01.210> your<00:02:01.360> level<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.320> guy<00:02:02.680> who

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
logic into your level so the guy who

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.100 
logic into your level so the guy who
built<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.220> level<00:02:03.580> has<00:02:04.149> wired<00:02:04.750> up<00:02:04.960> these

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
built this level has wired up these

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.340 
built this level has wired up these
levers<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.640> by<00:02:06.910> grabbing<00:02:07.509> them<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.200> can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
levers and by grabbing them you can

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.600 
levers and by grabbing them you can
build<00:02:08.530> whole<00:02:08.770> machines<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.520> can

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
build whole machines and you can

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.640 
build whole machines and you can
actually<00:02:09.729> build<00:02:10.000> incredibly<00:02:10.660> intricate<00:02:11.020> like

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
actually build incredibly intricate like

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.820 
actually build incredibly intricate like
complicated<00:02:12.580> mechanisms<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:14.230> allow<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
complicated mechanisms that allow you to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.860 
complicated mechanisms that allow you to
build<00:02:14.980> new<00:02:15.910> kinds<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.209> gameplay<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.660> doesn't

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
build new kinds of gameplay it doesn't

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.289 
build new kinds of gameplay it doesn't
just<00:02:17.019> have<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.350> what<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.830> thought<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.299> you

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
just have to be what we thought of you

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.360 
just have to be what we thought of you
can<00:02:19.480> get<00:02:19.570> squashed

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.190 

okay<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.090> again<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.900> would<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.110> been

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
okay so again this bit would have been

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770 
okay so again this bit would have been
way<00:02:25.440> quicker<00:02:25.739> co-op<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.180> sure<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.660> play

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
way quicker co-op so sure you can play

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.570 
way quicker co-op so sure you can play
this<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.170> own<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:29.250> you'd<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
this on your own but if you'd had a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.009 
this on your own but if you'd had a
friend<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.000> help<00:02:30.209> work<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.780> could

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
friend to help work with that you could

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
friend to help work with that you could
have<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.260> plowed<00:02:31.680> through<00:02:31.890> every<00:02:32.819> level<00:02:33.030> has

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.729 

one<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.510> favorite<00:02:42.900> bits<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.230> level<00:02:43.439> is

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
one of my favorite bits in this level is

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.319 
one of my favorite bits in this level is
the<00:02:44.069> elephant<00:02:44.519> which<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.909> next<00:02:45.209> section

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
the elephant which is this next section

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.099 
the elephant which is this next section
so<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.999> say<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.180> provide<00:02:48.749> you<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.019> the

so as I say we provide you with the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.199 
so as I say we provide you with the
inspiration<00:02:49.739> for<00:02:49.889> your<00:02:49.950> own<00:02:50.099> levels<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.790> one

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
inspiration for your own levels and one

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.190 
inspiration for your own levels and one
of<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.359> things<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.659> you<00:02:51.749> get<00:02:51.959> for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
of the things that you get for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.129 
of the things that you get for
completing<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.739> level<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.689> the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
completing the level is if you like the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.690 
completing the level is if you like the
elements<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.680> made<00:02:55.889> that<00:02:56.069> level<00:02:56.370> ah

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
elements that made that level ah

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.119 
elements that made that level ah
so<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.510> case<00:02:57.689> this<00:02:57.930> elephant<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.980> this

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
so in this case this elephant is this

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.699 
so in this case this elephant is this
kind<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> like<00:02:59.519> moving<00:02:59.909> creature<00:03:00.409> if<00:03:01.409> he

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
kind of like moving creature if he

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.500 
kind of like moving creature if he
manages<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.189> complete<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.579> in<00:03:02.760> time<00:03:02.939> he<00:03:03.389> will

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
manages to complete this in time he will

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.360 
manages to complete this in time he will
then<00:03:03.659> win<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.260> right<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.769> use<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.280> his

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
then win the right to use that in his

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.009 
then win the right to use that in his
own<00:03:05.489> levels<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.090> that's<00:03:06.209> kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.599> cycle

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
own levels and that's kind of a cycle

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.869 
own levels and that's kind of a cycle
the<00:03:07.409> we<00:03:07.530> call<00:03:07.709> play<00:03:07.919> create<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.430> share<00:03:08.609> so

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
the we call play create and share so

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.309 
the we call play create and share so
it's<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.540> play<00:03:09.750> through<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:09.989> level<00:03:10.019> you

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
it's like you play through the level you
