00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
just based on that and then also kind of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
just based on that and then also kind of
what<00:00:28.140> feed<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> they've<00:00:28.980> been<00:00:29.160> feeding<00:00:29.399> them

is also important to kind of know when

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.049 
is also important to kind of know when
we<00:00:31.890> start<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.340> head<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> horse

mandible and over the temporal areas so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
mandible and over the temporal areas so
some<00:00:45.030> horses<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.810> start<00:00:46.080> to<00:00:46.170> have

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
some horses when they start to have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
used to chew food and those are located

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
used to chew food and those are located
right<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.729> through<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.180> area<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
right down through this area here and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.819 
right down through this area here and
those<00:01:08.250> teeth<00:01:08.579> actually<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.750> far<00:01:10.290> enough<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
from about right here back that far so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.959 
from about right here back that far so
those<00:01:16.649> teeth<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.159> important<00:01:17.850> for

those teeth are very important for

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.730 
those teeth are very important for
grinding<00:01:18.329> up<00:01:18.479> food<00:01:18.719> materials<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.409> those<00:01:19.590> are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
grinding up food materials so those are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
grinding up food materials so those are
that's<00:01:20.249> important<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.149> know<00:01:21.299> even

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that's important to kind of know even

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109 
that's important to kind of know even
for<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.929> owner<00:01:22.139> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.429> a<00:01:23.639> clinician
