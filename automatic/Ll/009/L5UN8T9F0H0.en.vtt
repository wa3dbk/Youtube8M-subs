activating foolish burial let's see what

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
activating foolish burial let's see what
he<00:00:15.210> sends<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.839> might<00:00:16.170> reveal<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.710> deck

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
he sends and this might reveal what deck

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
he sends and this might reveal what deck
he's<00:00:17.100> running<00:00:18.080> but<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.560> lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.920> decks

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
can still write the plant engine just

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.080 
can still write the plant engine just
because<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> good<00:00:23.519> okay<00:00:24.140> I

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
because it was about to the good okay I

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
because it was about to the good okay I
didn't<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.269> coming<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.900> don't<00:00:28.380> see<00:00:28.710> too

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
didn't see that coming I don't see too

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.669 
didn't see that coming I don't see too
many<00:00:28.980> people<00:00:29.279> even<00:00:29.429> playing<00:00:29.760> Oh<00:00:30.029> Ron<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.410> I'm

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
many people even playing Oh Ron but I'm

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.290 
many people even playing Oh Ron but I'm
all<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:31.949> innovation<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.120> ever

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
all about innovation and if so ever

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500 
all about innovation and if so ever
activate<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.530> different<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.360> he's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
activate some different things so he's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.900 
activate some different things so he's
going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> remove<00:00:37.190> brawn<00:00:38.190> over<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
going to remove brawn over there and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200 
going to remove brawn over there and
he's<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.649> discard<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:41.070> card<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:42.000> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
he's going to discard one card which can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
he's going to discard one card which can
be<00:00:42.300> brow<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> he'll<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.379> able<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> draw<00:00:43.770> one

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
be brow and he'll be able to draw one

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.690 
be brow and he'll be able to draw one
more<00:00:44.100> card<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> perhaps<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.410> why<00:00:46.620> he<00:00:46.890> did

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
more card so perhaps that's why he did

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.229 
more card so perhaps that's why he did
that<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:49.430> was<00:00:50.430> thinking<00:00:50.520> maybe<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.120> gay

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that I was thinking maybe he was gay

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.290 
that I was thinking maybe he was gay
before<00:00:51.410> first<00:00:52.410> turned<00:00:52.680> someone<00:00:53.070> graefe<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.270> i

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
before first turned someone graefe but i

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
before first turned someone graefe but i
always<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.750> rafa<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.289> much<00:00:55.620> better<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:58.280> be

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
always think rafa is much better to be

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
always think rafa is much better to be
able<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> discard<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> while<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.379> opened<00:01:01.620> up

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
able to discard and while he opened up

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
able to discard and while he opened up
pretty<00:01:01.920> good<00:01:02.100> any<00:01:02.760> time<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.270> open

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
pretty good any time when you can open

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660 
pretty good any time when you can open
up<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.660> cha<00:01:03.840> does<00:01:04.229> shoot<00:01:04.409> first<00:01:04.680> turn<00:01:04.949> really

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
up with cha does shoot first turn really

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
up with cha does shoot first turn really
sets<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.330> an<00:01:06.600> advantage<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> game<00:01:07.490> I'm

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sets you at an advantage in the game I'm

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
sets you at an advantage in the game I'm
thinking<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> facedown<00:01:09.119> card<00:01:09.390> could<00:01:09.810> Bea

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
thinking the facedown card could Bea

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.740 
thinking the facedown card could Bea
morphing<00:01:10.439> jar<00:01:10.939> dark<00:01:11.939> wills<00:01:12.090> don't<00:01:12.360> run<00:01:12.510> too

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
morphing jar dark wills don't run too

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.800 
morphing jar dark wills don't run too
much<00:01:12.780> things<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.680> set<00:01:14.040> other<00:01:14.250> than

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
much things that they can set other than

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.370 
much things that they can set other than
morphing<00:01:15.810> jar<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:17.040> good<00:01:18.380> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
morphing jar that are actually good so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.539 
morphing jar that are actually good so
we're<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:19.740> targeting<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.310> card

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
we're going to be targeting that card

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
we're going to be targeting that card
which<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.909> can't<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.840> probably

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
which we can't see but it probably

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
which we can't see but it probably
something<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.759> perhaps<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> only

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
something good or perhaps the only

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.219 
something good or perhaps the only
monster<00:01:24.810> he<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.640> but<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
monster he has but let's see what the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.550 
monster he has but let's see what the
blue<00:01:28.409> player<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:31.880> yeah<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
blue player can do here and yeah so I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
blue player can do here and yeah so I
mean<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:35.850> set<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.420> card

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
mean I mean you could set this card

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.289 
mean I mean you could set this card
instead<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> activating<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> um<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
instead of activating it um I think in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
instead of activating it um I think in
the<00:01:39.600> position<00:01:40.110> well<00:01:40.590> he<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.340> didn't

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the position well he actually didn't

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.730 
the position well he actually didn't
down<00:01:41.909> nevermind<00:01:42.720> who<00:01:43.320> wouldn't<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.619> been

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
down nevermind who wouldn't have been

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
down nevermind who wouldn't have been
that<00:01:43.770> great<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> skilled<00:01:47.040> ring<00:01:47.250> another<00:01:47.939> very

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that great so skilled ring another very

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.020 
that great so skilled ring another very
good<00:01:48.570> card<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.340> obviously<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:50.729> knows<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
good card and obviously he knows the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
good card and obviously he knows the
blue<00:01:51.149> player<00:01:51.360> doesn't<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:52.079> MS<00:01:52.439> see

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
blue player doesn't have MS see

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
blue player doesn't have MS see
otherwise<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.159> would<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.340> gotten<00:01:53.579> activated

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
otherwise he would have gotten activated

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.649 
otherwise he would have gotten activated
skill<00:01:54.509> drain<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.920> now<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.610> curry<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.360> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
skill drain and so now the curry is in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.499 
skill drain and so now the curry is in
attack<00:01:58.049> position<00:01:58.880> and<00:02:02.090> he<00:02:03.090> didn't<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
attack position and he didn't get the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
attack position and he didn't get the
effect<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:03.960> he's<00:02:04.140> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.530> bad<00:02:04.680> position

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
effect so he's kind of in a bad position

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.749 
effect so he's kind of in a bad position
right<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.540> uh<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.680> calories<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
right here but uh you know calories can

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.750 
right here but uh you know calories can
still<00:02:09.030> come<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:10.340> most<00:02:11.340> kind<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> career

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
still come back most kind of career

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.000 
still come back most kind of career
decks<00:02:11.879> are<00:02:12.060> playing<00:02:12.300> embassy

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
decks are playing embassy

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.319 
decks are playing embassy
so<00:02:14.010> let's<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.430> what<00:02:14.579> he<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:14.909> far<00:02:15.150> because

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
so let's see what he can go far because

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.390 
so let's see what he can go far because
category<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.049> we<00:02:16.349> can<00:02:16.500> push<00:02:16.739> relatively

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
category is that we can push relatively

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.649 
category is that we can push relatively
quick<00:02:18.409> so<00:02:19.409> oh<00:02:20.480> he<00:02:21.480> got<00:02:21.599> trapped<00:02:21.810> uh<00:02:21.959> shoe<00:02:23.659> which

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
quick so oh he got trapped uh shoe which

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.270 
quick so oh he got trapped uh shoe which
is<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:28.099> wouldn't<00:02:29.099> rent

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
is a pretty good and I wouldn't rent

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.569 
is a pretty good and I wouldn't rent
morphing<00:02:29.670> jar<00:02:29.700> oh<00:02:29.939> it<00:02:30.239> was<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:30.959> morphing<00:02:31.470> jar

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
morphing jar oh it was not morphing jar

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.280 
morphing jar oh it was not morphing jar
that's<00:02:32.579> interesting<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:34.019> with<00:02:34.109> dark

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that's interesting I think with dark

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.839 
that's interesting I think with dark
well<00:02:34.409> is<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.769> Bluff<00:02:35.010> people<00:02:35.519> pretty<00:02:35.760> well

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
well is you can Bluff people pretty well

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.149 
well is you can Bluff people pretty well
actually<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.079> people<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:37.890> want

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
actually just because people don't want

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.429 
actually just because people don't want
to<00:02:38.250> attack<00:02:38.459> into<00:02:38.700> morphing<00:02:39.030> jar<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:40.349> he's

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
to attack into morphing jar so he's

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.780 
to attack into morphing jar so he's
going<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> bounce<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.890> back<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.220> graefe<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
going to bounce it back for graefe and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to bounce it back for graefe and
he<00:02:42.659> still<00:02:42.870> hasn't<00:02:43.079> normal<00:02:43.439> someone<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.859> this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
he still hasn't normal someone for this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.009 
he still hasn't normal someone for this
turn<00:02:44.189> so<00:02:44.370> he<00:02:44.549> can<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:45.060> push<00:02:45.269> if<00:02:45.510> he<00:02:45.810> wishes

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
turn so he can kind of push if he wishes

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.309 
turn so he can kind of push if he wishes
to<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:47.340> think<00:02:47.690> if<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.049> wanted<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
to I think if you really wanted to

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.319 
to I think if you really wanted to
torrential<00:02:49.680> oh<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.700> wouldn't<00:02:50.849> even<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.120> good

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
torrential oh it wouldn't even be good

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.250 
torrential oh it wouldn't even be good
right<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:53.269> because<00:02:54.269> obviously<00:02:54.629> he's<00:02:54.989> still

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
right now because obviously he's still

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.330 
right now because obviously he's still
others<00:02:57.799> soon<00:02:58.799> activate<00:02:59.220> dragged<00:02:59.489> down<00:02:59.780> and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
others soon activate dragged down and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.679 
others soon activate dragged down and
the<00:03:02.340> thing<00:03:02.459> went<00:03:02.609> dark<00:03:02.819> holds<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.569> don't

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
the thing went dark holds is you don't

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.330 
the thing went dark holds is you don't
really<00:03:03.930> need<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.200> activate<00:03:04.590> drag<00:03:04.859> down<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.099> mean

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
really need to activate drag down I mean

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.300 
really need to activate drag down I mean
if<00:03:06.209> he<00:03:06.420> has<00:03:06.599> obviously<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:07.260> really<00:03:07.680> good<00:03:08.040> power

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
if he has obviously a really good power

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.149 
if he has obviously a really good power
card<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:09.629> yeah<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.989> could<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.439> activating

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
card then yeah I could see activating

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.129 
card then yeah I could see activating
drag<00:03:11.370> down<00:03:11.549> would<00:03:12.389> make<00:03:12.540> sense<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.019> thing

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
drag down would make sense but the thing

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.539 
drag down would make sense but the thing
is<00:03:13.200> you're<00:03:13.560> letting<00:03:13.829> your<00:03:13.889> opponent<00:03:14.010> cycle

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
is you're letting your opponent cycle

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.780 
is you're letting your opponent cycle
cards<00:03:14.909> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.989> don't<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:17.010> econ<00:03:17.370> would<00:03:17.609> be

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
cards and I don't think econ would be

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.819 
cards and I don't think econ would be
that<00:03:18.389> great<00:03:18.599> because<00:03:18.840> there's<00:03:19.799> really

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
that great because there's really

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.119 
that great because there's really
messican<00:03:20.310> taken<00:03:20.609> Dark<00:03:20.790> Worlds<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.389> too

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
messican taken Dark Worlds that's too

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.599 
messican taken Dark Worlds that's too
devastating<00:03:23.129> um<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:25.250> mean<00:03:26.250> yeah<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.400> could

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
devastating um I mean yeah you could

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.309 
devastating um I mean yeah you could
synchro<00:03:27.060> with<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.419> but<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.720> can't<00:03:27.959> synchro

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
synchro with it but you can't synchro

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.500 
synchro with it but you can't synchro
with<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:29.519> card<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.000> can't<00:03:30.209> really<00:03:30.299> sink

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
with this card you can't really sink

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.729 
with this card you can't really sink
with<00:03:30.659> graphic<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.109> pretty<00:03:31.290> much<00:03:31.379> all<00:03:31.590> they

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
with graphic that's pretty much all they

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.319 
with graphic that's pretty much all they
leave<00:03:31.919> on<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.159> field<00:03:32.370> unless<00:03:33.090> they're<00:03:33.209> going

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
leave on the field unless they're going

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.939 
leave on the field unless they're going
to<00:03:33.389> like<00:03:33.569> game<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.199> that's<00:03:34.560> one<00:03:34.739> thing<00:03:34.859> to

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
to like game you and that's one thing to

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.520 
to like game you and that's one thing to
note<00:03:35.099> when<00:03:35.190> you're<00:03:35.310> playing<00:03:35.430> Dark<00:03:35.639> Worlds

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
note when you're playing Dark Worlds

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.319 
note when you're playing Dark Worlds
don't<00:03:37.530> summon<00:03:38.280> your<00:03:38.459> other<00:03:38.639> cards<00:03:39.150> unless

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
don't summon your other cards unless

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.229 
don't summon your other cards unless
you're<00:03:39.540> bouncing<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:39.989> graphic<00:03:40.290> basically

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
you're bouncing for graphic basically

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.219 
you're bouncing for graphic basically
because<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:42.359> they<00:03:42.449> can<00:03:42.479> make<00:03:42.780> like<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
because then they can make like a

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.199 
because then they can make like a
colossal<00:03:43.949> fighter<00:03:44.099> which<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.849> be<00:03:44.970> kind<00:03:45.180> of

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
colossal fighter which can be kind of

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.119 
colossal fighter which can be kind of
hard<00:03:45.389> for<00:03:45.449> thoughtful<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.739> deal<00:03:46.889> with<00:03:47.010> if

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
hard for thoughtful to deal with if

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.189 
hard for thoughtful to deal with if
they're<00:03:47.310> artists<00:03:47.729> on<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:48.150> graph<00:03:48.359> us<00:03:48.540> because

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
they're artists on the graph us because

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.180 
they're artists on the graph us because
skilled<00:03:49.470> ring<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.799> thought<00:03:49.979> of<00:03:50.099> that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
skilled ring just thought of that

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.250 
skilled ring just thought of that
colossal<00:03:50.400> fighter<00:03:50.760> because<00:03:51.599> classified<00:03:52.169> it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
colossal fighter because classified it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.289 
colossal fighter because classified it
does<00:03:52.409> result<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.949> the<00:03:53.069> graveyard<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.060> don't

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
does result in the graveyard so I don't

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.240 
does result in the graveyard so I don't
think<00:03:57.449> our<00:03:57.690> character<00:03:58.139> a<00:03:58.169> player<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.979> come

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
think our character a player can come

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.580 
think our character a player can come
back<00:03:59.370> anytime<00:03:59.699> soon<00:03:59.879> unless<00:04:00.359> he<00:04:01.169> have<00:04:01.319> them<00:04:01.440> to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
back anytime soon unless he have them to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.750 
back anytime soon unless he have them to
draw<00:04:01.769> into<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> heavy<00:04:02.220> storm<00:04:04.400> but<00:04:05.400> yeah<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.549> think

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
draw into a heavy storm but yeah I think

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.069 
draw into a heavy storm but yeah I think
that<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> better<00:04:06.329> play<00:04:06.569> would<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.840> not<00:04:07.049> to

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
that a better play would be not to

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.490 
that a better play would be not to
activating<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:09.209> drag<00:04:09.540> downs<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.379> way

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
activating the drag downs and that way

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.170 
activating the drag downs and that way
your<00:04:10.739> opponent<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.190> cycle<00:04:11.609> through<00:04:11.639> cards

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
your opponent can cycle through cards

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.809 
your opponent can cycle through cards
because<00:04:12.419> obviously<00:04:12.810> heavy<00:04:13.739> storm<00:04:14.129> is<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.430> card

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
because obviously heavy storm is a card

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.440 
because obviously heavy storm is a card
that<00:04:14.970> would<00:04:15.030> hurt<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.389> darker

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
that would hurt the darker

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.700 
that would hurt the darker
at<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.840> moment<00:04:17.020> so<00:04:18.240> I<00:04:19.240> may<00:04:19.870> be<00:04:19.930> summoning<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
at the moment so I may be summoning a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:33.900 
at the moment so I may be summoning a
beige<00:04:21.640> over<00:04:22.060> here<00:04:29.220> what<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:32.580> ok<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:33.640> he

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
beige over here what is that ok so he

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.730 
beige over here what is that ok so he
can<00:04:34.120> special<00:04:34.510> summon<00:04:34.540> another<00:04:35.290> character<00:04:35.710> a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
can special summon another character a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.050 
can special summon another character a
monster<00:04:36.160> because<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:38.470> does<00:04:39.280> resolve<00:04:39.640> off<00:04:39.790> the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
monster because it does resolve off the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.910 
monster because it does resolve off the
fields<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:40.480> unaffected<00:04:40.840> by<00:04:41.080> skilled<00:04:41.440> ring<00:04:41.620> so

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
fields is unaffected by skilled ring so

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.650 
fields is unaffected by skilled ring so
I<00:04:42.310> kara<00:04:42.670> kuru<00:04:42.820> player<00:04:43.090> looks<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.420> he's<00:04:43.540> going

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
I kara kuru player looks like he's going

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.050 
I kara kuru player looks like he's going
to<00:04:43.750> be<00:04:43.840> able<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.260> survive<00:04:44.650> one<00:04:45.490> more<00:04:45.640> turn<00:04:45.850> at

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
to be able to survive one more turn at

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.010 
to be able to survive one more turn at
least<00:04:47.520> he's<00:04:48.520> checking<00:04:48.880> his<00:04:48.910> deck<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.750> see<00:04:49.900> what

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
least he's checking his deck to see what

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.930 
least he's checking his deck to see what
he<00:04:50.110> wants<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.560> but<00:04:50.980> skilled<00:04:51.610> rains<00:04:51.760> on<00:04:51.910> the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
he wants to get but skilled rains on the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.500 
he wants to get but skilled rains on the
field<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:52.480> most<00:04:53.440> likely<00:04:53.790> he<00:04:54.790> won't<00:04:55.030> be<00:04:55.240> able<00:04:55.330> to

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
field so most likely he won't be able to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.830 
field so most likely he won't be able to
do<00:04:55.600> anything<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:57.220> yeah<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.640> felt<00:04:57.910> like<00:04:58.090> doing

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
do anything but yeah I felt like doing

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.630 
do anything but yeah I felt like doing
drag<00:04:59.020> down<00:04:59.170> was<00:04:59.350> just<00:04:59.620> not<00:04:59.920> necessarily<00:05:00.370> miss

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
drag down was just not necessarily miss

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.400 
drag down was just not necessarily miss
play<00:05:00.880> just<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.660> don't<00:05:01.780> want<00:05:01.990> your<00:05:02.050> poem<00:05:02.290> to

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
play just you don't want your poem to

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.010 
play just you don't want your poem to
draw<00:05:02.590> into<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:02.890> heavy<00:05:03.130> storm<00:05:03.430> but<00:05:04.240> because<00:05:04.900> you

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
draw into a heavy storm but because you

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.390 
draw into a heavy storm but because you
know<00:05:05.110> carries<00:05:05.530> can<00:05:05.680> still<00:05:05.860> explode<00:05:06.190> at<00:05:06.280> any

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
know carries can still explode at any

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.340 
know carries can still explode at any
time<00:05:06.790> but<00:05:07.390> that's<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.630> one<00:05:07.750> thing<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.110> note

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350
