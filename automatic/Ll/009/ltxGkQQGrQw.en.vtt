00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.930
 very good to everyone today explanation 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.820
 away and today we are in gta 5 and os 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.530
 I'm going to teach how to get a weapon that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 there's special in map 1 is hidden 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.100
 then for this you must come to this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.380
 point of the map is above the city 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.990
 main and you have to communicate this point 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.550
 It's just in front of a tunnel os 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.180
 I recommend that you go with a car that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 be fast and not a motorcycle because with the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.660
 you will not get it, but then 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.390
 this difficult issue to escape alive 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 of where we will go if nothing happens 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.770
 then they kill us because when they reappear 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 reappear and go with the gun but good 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.840
 I recommend you see with a car 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.400
 fast what we do is that we will have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.350
 to get a little bit of speed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.140
 from as far as you get a little bit 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 of wheelbarrow so to speak and we 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.810
 we headed towards the tunnel and before 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.850
 get to the tunnel we put it to the part of 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.920
 the right that like a small ramp 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.620
 that makes the mountain then we use that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.079
 this mountain to fit us inside 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 from the airport once inside the 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.590
 airport hand do this very fast 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.750
 then the reference is to pass the two 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 helicopters on the left 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 and after passing it there are two tiers 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.250
 we do not put on the left between 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.080
 two tiers 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.330
 and we will have to break a door 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.190
 metallic one times break our door 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.380
 metal we have to put the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.390
 building that has the green door this 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.280
 let there be left then 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.780
 we enter the building and if we find 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.210
 some enemy down here we kill him 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.400
 but quickly we go to the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 stairs and what we have to do is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.090
 go up six floors go up until no 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.300
 we can go higher in these same 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 stairs then once we have a 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.630
 we do once we have arrived 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.860
 to the sixth floor good as you see here 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 there are other stairs but we should not 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.369
 catch more we'll have to get in here 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.380
 inside this room and there will be an enemy 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.240
 is the control tower so good what 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.070
 we kill and on the ground is the weapon 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960
 special classified that is like a 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.030
 Hence the death machine and there you see the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 we have then to select the l1 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.490
 and the selected as you see I am like 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.039
 the airport control tower and 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 well, we would only have to go down 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.930
 stairs 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.110
 for the same ones that we have climbed and good 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.450
 once down and to use the weapon I leave a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 little bit of how the gun works and good 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.380
 I do not escape from here alive 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.030
 I have a motorcycle and well, there is a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.340
 tank and there 's everything then quite 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.160
 In the meantime leave but if you go with a car 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.390
 that is fast you can leave fast 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.640
 through the door you go to the door and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.360
 You can not enter if you are not the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.130
 contrary site 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.420
 you have to follow the road more 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.880
 exit that the left go there is a 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.350
 you know it and you leave if you do not 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.180
 kill nothing happens you are going to reappear with 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.860
 the weapon is worth so good see you in
