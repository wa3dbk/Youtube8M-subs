 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.090
 summer heat is hot not only for you but also for yours 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 accessories give tips on how to cool 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.859
 hot filling your computer as it may 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.199
 strange to begin with need to bring in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
 order an apartment to hang nets on the windows 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 and open them hang dark curtains and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 window curtains ideally need 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.240
 air conditioning and if there is money 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 We recommend if there is no air conditioning 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 use floor fans 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.809
 Further, all the same computer to start to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 clean it from dust 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.680
 compressed air from a can or 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.329
 with a cloth be careful and not 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.579
 break down fragile items 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.309
 check that nothing interferes with the unit 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.860
 supply do air intake further 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.079
 buy reobas if it is not set in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.879
 chassis fans to the maximum strong 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 blowing very much does not hurt 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.940
 naturally take care of the filters 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.520
 in front of fans 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.550
 if they don't have advice to you at least once every three 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 month clean your computer 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.879
 fix fan on the video card to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.970
 he blew the motherboard 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.280
 Download the program aida64 and watch for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.799
 temperatures should not be 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.159
 above 97 degrees for a video card 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.900
 95 degrees for the processor 65 degrees 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.200
 for motherboard chipsets 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.060
 44 degrees for the winchester if your 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340
 numbers are greater than or close to this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.040
 think about blowing and be sure 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 remove overclocking if it is possible even 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.360
 do anti overclocking by lowering the frequency but 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 voltage is better to leave as a car 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 good temperature is no more 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 eighty five degrees for 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 video cards not more than 70 degrees for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 CPU not more than 38 degrees for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.490
 Winchester and 45 degrees in the system 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 boards can live with an open system unit 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.600
 if it lowers the temperature 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.579
 but don't forget to blow nothing 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.079
 it is better to cool iron than direct air cooling 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.939
 from the fan water cooling 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 works better but stay tuned 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.079
 temperature water has a property 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.450
 leak if you overheat 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.700
 cpu change cooler to cooler 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.829
 performance in the case and again 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.910
 fx 8300 matches in case of 4690 c. 4790 key 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.260
 or processors fx 8320 fx 8350 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.540
 and older in the midst 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.400
 if the video card overheats we do not 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.439
 We will advise you to substitute arctic cooler 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.970
 you can destroy the card badly 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.340
 cooling batteries 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.980
 better then change the card to a quieter 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.900
 about your sell remember that cooler and and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.209
 water blocks for video cards are set as 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.220
 Reference &amp; reference only 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 This is the reference board design and cooler from 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.250
 manufacturer in this case md or 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.549
 nvidia 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.989
 They also say it would be good to change the thermal paste 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.079
 processor and video card 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.450
 if she is old mx2 pasta from arctic 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.700
 perfect soap only this advice 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.739
 will not give you can slap 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.840
 socket processor or break the legs 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 if suddenly remove the processors and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.069
 start to sweat and put fears 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.500
 I reassemble the processor video card 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.079
 You can also make something up, so 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.120
 better watch educational videos first 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.639
 on this topic and whether call on guests more 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.769
 skillful comrades but to always be 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.629
 cold you need air conditioning well 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.500
 blown housing with fans on 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.540
 blowing and blowing 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.700
 or even better when the fan and bottom and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.409
 top and well- chosen iron 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.010
 which in itself is not prone to 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.680
 heat up 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.680
 with you was kirill all bye bye
