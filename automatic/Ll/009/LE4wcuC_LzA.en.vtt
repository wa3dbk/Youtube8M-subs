00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
impressive probably impossible in an

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.160 
impressive probably impossible in an
American<00:01:24.770> school<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.790> one<00:01:26.030> no<00:01:26.630> doing<00:01:27.020> these

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
American school this one no doing these

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
it's probably an impossibility be due to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.730 
it's probably an impossibility be due to
the<00:01:31.159> discipline<00:01:31.670> oh<00:01:32.049> because<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:33.289> requires

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
the discipline oh because this requires

the discipline oh because this requires
discipline<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.890> lot<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:39.729> this<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:40.999> one

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
discipline and a lot of it this is one

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.120
