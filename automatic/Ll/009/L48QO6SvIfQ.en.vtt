00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
you see in the video you should sort of
see<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> truck<00:01:22.140> bed<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> disappear<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
see the truck bed kind of disappear and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.130 
see the truck bed kind of disappear and
if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.630> you've<00:01:24.840> done<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
if you see it then you've done it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.510 
if you see it then you've done it
correct<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.799> hit<00:01:26.040> B<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
correct and all you do is hit B and then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
correct and all you do is hit B and then
it<00:01:26.640> should<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.180> I'll<00:01:27.659> show<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it should be there I'll show it again in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
it should be there I'll show it again in
the<00:01:28.380> video<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.070> thing<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the video and one thing I do want to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
the video and one thing I do want to
mention<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.479> drive<00:01:30.689> outside

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
mention is that if you do drive outside

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
mention is that if you do drive outside
and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:32.009> into<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> custom

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and then you go back into the custom

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.130 
and then you go back into the custom
shop<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> mess<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> truck<00:01:33.960> bed

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
shop and you mess with the truck bed

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.460 
shop and you mess with the truck bed
it's<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.140> change<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> back<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it's probably going to change it back to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's probably going to change it back to
normal<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.189> gonna<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
normal so you're gonna have to do the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.460 
normal so you're gonna have to do the
glitch<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.930> video<00:01:40.110> as

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
glitch again as you see in this video as

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.050 
glitch again as you see in this video as
well<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> did<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.400> me<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> couple<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
well but this did take me a couple of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
well but this did take me a couple of
tries<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> takes<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
tries to actually get so if it takes you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
tries to actually get so if it takes you
a<00:01:43.680> couple<00:01:43.979> tries<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> normal<00:01:45.570> but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a couple tries then that is normal but

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
a couple tries then that is normal but
again<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> truck<00:01:47.610> bed<00:01:47.850> you

and it should be not there like it I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
and it should be not there like it I
mean<00:02:03.090> it'll<00:02:03.420> show<00:02:03.689> while<00:02:04.649> you're<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
will disappear and it's pretty cool

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.150 
will disappear and it's pretty cool
because<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.649> don't<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:10.979> see

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
because you know you don't really see

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
because you know you don't really see
this<00:02:11.280> too<00:02:11.459> often<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.780> another

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
this too often and it's just another

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.850 
this too often and it's just another
unique<00:02:13.470> little

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
unique little

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
unique little
customization<00:02:14.310> thing<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.420> car

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
customization thing for this car

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.450 
customization thing for this car
especially<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> fact<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.190> free

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
especially the fact that it's free

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.890 
especially the fact that it's free
definitely<00:02:18.180> makes<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> look<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.750> bit

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
definitely makes it look a little bit

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.360 
definitely makes it look a little bit
better<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:19.290> opinion<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.250> pretty

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
better in my opinion but that is pretty

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.590 
better in my opinion but that is pretty
much<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.700> with<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.880> video<00:02:21.000> hope<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> guys

don't have any internet issues I was
having<00:02:32.910> some<00:02:33.090> internet<00:02:33.480> problems<00:02:33.510> last<00:02:34.050> night

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
having some internet problems last night

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
having some internet problems last night
that's<00:02:34.380> why<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> livestream<00:02:35.220> internet<00:02:35.940> kept

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that's why that livestream internet kept

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.430 
that's why that livestream internet kept
going<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.780> I've<00:02:36.990> been<00:02:37.020> having<00:02:37.320> this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
problems like a week now I think I might

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.760 
problems like a week now I think I might
have<00:02:39.480> fixed<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.050> hopefully<00:02:40.380> that'll<00:02:40.680> be

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
have fixed it so hopefully that'll be
