00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
still thinking after 20 years that's

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.530 
still thinking after 20 years that's
what<00:02:52.810> gives<00:02:53.049> them<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.530> show-me-state

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
mentality so we see someone who has

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.440 
mentality so we see someone who has
something<00:02:59.230> that<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.220> don't<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.640> instead<00:03:01.299> of

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
something that we don't have instead of

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.360 
something that we don't have instead of
congratulating<00:03:02.049> or<00:03:02.470> saying<00:03:02.859> that's<00:03:03.099> nice

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
congratulating or saying that's nice

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.330 
congratulating or saying that's nice
