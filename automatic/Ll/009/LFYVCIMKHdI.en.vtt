notification<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.689> necessarily

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
notification so that's not necessarily

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
notification so that's not necessarily
very<00:01:25.979> helpful<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> something<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.509> keep

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
very helpful but it is something to keep

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210 
very helpful but it is something to keep
in<00:01:27.780> mind<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:28.619> doing<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.040> because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in mind when you're doing this because

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.670 
in mind when you're doing this because
you're<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.970> any<00:01:30.119> type<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
you're not going to get any type of

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
you're not going to get any type of
animation<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.340> dismiss<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> banner<00:01:33.299> when<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
animation to dismiss the banner when you

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
animation to dismiss the banner when you
swipe<00:01:33.930> across<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.799> let's<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.369> ahead<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
swipe across it so let's go ahead and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.649 
swipe across it so let's go ahead and
send<00:01:35.759> myself<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.299> message<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
send myself a message right here and

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.999 
send myself a message right here and
then<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.960> our<00:01:40.079> banner<00:01:40.290> notification<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
then we have our banner notification so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.340 
then we have our banner notification so
we're<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> swipe<00:01:41.460> once<00:01:41.790> twice<00:01:42.540> three

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
we're going to swipe once twice three

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.370 
we're going to swipe once twice three
times<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.460> should<00:01:44.700> get<00:01:44.880> three

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
times and then we should get three

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
times and then we should get three
notifications<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> same

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
notifications again from that same

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.300 
notifications again from that same
notification<00:01:48.420> within<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.710> minute<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> let's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
notification within one minute so let's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
notification within one minute so let's
go<00:01:50.399> ahead<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.610> skip<00:01:50.880> ahead<00:01:51.030> alright<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.020> we

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
go ahead and skip ahead alright so we

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
go ahead and skip ahead alright so we
should<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> coming<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.700> minute

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
should be coming up on this one minute

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
should be coming up on this one minute
mark<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.479> shortly<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.799> right

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
mark very shortly and you can see right

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
mark very shortly and you can see right
there<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:56.610> getting<00:01:59.630> 123

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
there that we're actually getting 123

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.480 
there that we're actually getting 123
notifications<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
notifications right there so that just

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.240 
notifications right there so that just
basically<00:02:03.380> tells<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.710> amount<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.040> times

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
basically tells you the amount of times

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
basically tells you the amount of times
you<00:02:05.460> swiped<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.210> banner<00:02:06.450> notification

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
you swiped on that banner notification

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.359 
you swiped on that banner notification
next<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.319> tweak<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.890> purely

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
next up we have a tweak that's purely

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.710 
next up we have a tweak that's purely
visual<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.149> something<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.539> I'm<00:02:10.629> going

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
visual but it's something that I'm going

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.570 
visual but it's something that I'm going
to<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.869> using<00:02:11.019> on<00:02:11.290> my<00:02:11.319> device<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> want<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.489> go

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to be using on my device so I want to go

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.800 
to be using on my device so I want to go
ahead<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.819> show<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:12.970> guys<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:13.569> called

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
ahead and show you guys and it's called

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.080 
ahead and show you guys and it's called
app<00:02:13.989> color<00:02:14.470> clothes<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.489> usually<00:02:15.879> when<00:02:15.970> you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
app color clothes so usually when you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.910 
app color clothes so usually when you
put<00:02:16.239> your<00:02:16.269> device<00:02:16.629> into<00:02:16.840> wiggle<00:02:17.379> mode<00:02:17.560> it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
put your device into wiggle mode it's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.190 
put your device into wiggle mode it's
going<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.220> give<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.580> X<00:02:18.879> to<00:02:19.300> uninstall<00:02:19.840> an

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
going to give you that X to uninstall an

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.350 
going to give you that X to uninstall an
application<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.370> usually<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.030> a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
application now usually it's just a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.050 
application now usually it's just a
clear<00:02:23.080> has<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> transparent<00:02:23.980> look<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:24.970> with

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
clear has a transparent look to it with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.300 
clear has a transparent look to it with
a<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.299> bit<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.629> blur<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.860> not

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
a little bit of a blur and it's not

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.339 
a little bit of a blur and it's not
necessarily<00:02:27.549> something<00:02:28.239> great<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.930> look<00:02:29.110> at

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
necessarily something great to look at

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.410 
necessarily something great to look at
but<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:29.799> app<00:02:30.069> color<00:02:30.340> clothes<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.120> going<00:02:31.390> to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
but with app color clothes it's going to

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.070 
but with app color clothes it's going to
allow<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.110> show<00:02:33.180> these<00:02:34.180> different<00:02:34.720> colors

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
allow you to show these different colors

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.320 
allow you to show these different colors
for<00:02:35.290> specific<00:02:35.920> applications<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.760> basically

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
for specific applications so basically

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.820 
for specific applications so basically
taking<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.840> main<00:02:38.080> color<00:02:38.379> of<00:02:38.620> that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
taking the main color of that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.890 
taking the main color of that
application<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:39.940> putting<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.390> right

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
application and then putting it right

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.259 
application and then putting it right
there<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.860> X<00:02:42.099> when<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:42.940> wiggle

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
there for the X when you're in wiggle

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.000 
there for the X when you're in wiggle
mode<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.140> not<00:02:44.260> necessarily<00:02:44.319> something

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
mode so it's not necessarily something

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.559 
mode so it's not necessarily something
that's<00:02:45.250> extremely<00:02:45.370> helpful<00:02:46.090> or<00:02:46.269> anything

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
that's extremely helpful or anything

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.140 
that's extremely helpful or anything
like<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:46.750> but<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> nice<00:02:48.099> visual<00:02:48.549> tweak

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
like that but it is a nice visual tweak

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.460 
like that but it is a nice visual tweak
for<00:02:49.360> when<00:02:49.840> you're<00:02:49.959> managing<00:02:50.110> your

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
for when you're managing your

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.170 
for when you're managing your
springboard<00:02:50.920> next<00:02:51.519> up<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.819> lockscreen

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
springboard next up we have a lockscreen

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.360 
springboard next up we have a lockscreen
tweak<00:02:52.569> called<00:02:52.599> minimal<00:02:53.260> clock<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.160> let's<00:02:54.310> go

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
tweak called minimal clock so let's go

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.650 
tweak called minimal clock so let's go
ahead<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.549> jump<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.910> our<00:02:54.940> lock<00:02:55.239> screen<00:02:55.510> here

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
ahead and jump to our lock screen here

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.539 
ahead and jump to our lock screen here
and<00:02:55.750> I'll<00:02:55.810> show<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.019> what<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.349> does<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.370> can

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
and I'll show you what this does you can

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.339 
and I'll show you what this does you can
see<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.060> gives<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.540> time<00:02:58.870> over<00:02:59.170> here

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
see that it gives you the time over here

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.110 
see that it gives you the time over here
on<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> left<00:02:59.799> and<00:02:59.980> then<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> date<00:03:00.670> right<00:03:00.880> here

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
on the left and then the date right here

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
on the left and then the date right here
on<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> right<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.170> dark<00:03:02.860> gray

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
on the right so you have this dark gray

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.220 
on the right so you have this dark gray
color<00:03:03.640> right<00:03:04.239> here<00:03:04.569> that's<00:03:04.750> why<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.930> chose<00:03:05.170> this

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
color right here that's why I chose this

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.009 
color right here that's why I chose this
background<00:03:05.650> for<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.459> actual<00:03:07.420> lock<00:03:07.750> screen

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
background for the actual lock screen

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.680 
background for the actual lock screen
background<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:08.739> because<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.099> makes<00:03:09.129> the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
background just because it makes the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.360 
background just because it makes the
lettering<00:03:10.690> pop<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.799> can<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
lettering pop so you can see that it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.430 
lettering pop so you can see that it
says<00:03:12.459> 435<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:13.420> that's<00:03:13.810> what<00:03:13.959> time<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:14.290> is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
says 435 and that's what time it is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.199 
says 435 and that's what time it is
you'll<00:03:14.859> of<00:03:14.950> course<00:03:15.010> want<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.459> hide<00:03:15.670> your<00:03:15.880> clock

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
you'll of course want to hide your clock

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.849 
you'll of course want to hide your clock
right<00:03:16.450> here<00:03:16.690> probably<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.470> because<00:03:17.739> you

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
right here probably just because you

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.440 
right here probably just because you
want<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.069> get<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.220> minimal<00:03:18.730> lockscreen<00:03:19.209> look

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
want to get that minimal lockscreen look

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.449 
want to get that minimal lockscreen look
and<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:20.170> right<00:03:20.380> here<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:21.040> right<00:03:21.280> you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
and then right here on the right you

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.240 
and then right here on the right you
have<00:03:21.660> saturday<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.989> 16<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.100> just

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
have saturday the 16 so this is just

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.069 
have saturday the 16 so this is just
going<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.579> tell<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.030> date<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.840> there

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
going to tell you the date right there

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.660 
going to tell you the date right there
so<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.350> all<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:26.799> does<00:03:27.069> it's<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
so that's all that this does it's a

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.000 
so that's all that this does it's a
groovy<00:03:28.030> lock<00:03:28.269> lockscreen<00:03:29.109> theme<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.859> will

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
groovy lock lockscreen theme so you will

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.620

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
to go into groovy lock so we're going to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.190 
to go into groovy lock so we're going to
tap<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:42.940> make<00:03:43.329> sure<00:03:43.359> that<00:03:43.599> is<00:03:43.750> enabled

tap on that make sure that is enabled

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.449 
tap on that make sure that is enabled
and<00:03:44.319> they<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.829> want<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.040> select<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.430> theme

and they just want to select the theme

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.000 
and they just want to select the theme
to<00:03:45.880> be<00:03:46.000> minimal<00:03:46.450> clock<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.410> did<00:03:47.620> right

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
to be minimal clock and like I did right

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.410 
to be minimal clock and like I did right
here<00:03:48.310> you'll<00:03:48.459> want<00:03:48.639> to<00:03:48.730> hide<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.120> lock

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
here you'll want to hide that lock

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.210 
here you'll want to hide that lock
screen<00:03:49.750> clock<00:03:50.049> next<00:03:50.650> up<00:03:50.799> we<00:03:50.889> have<00:03:50.919> a<00:03:51.010> tweak

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
screen clock next up we have a tweak

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.490 
screen clock next up we have a tweak
called<00:03:51.250> another<00:03:51.819> cool<00:03:52.180> loader<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.200> this<00:03:53.380> is

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
called another cool loader so this is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.050 
called another cool loader so this is
basically<00:03:53.650> just<00:03:53.919> going<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.430> change<00:03:54.760> your

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
basically just going to change your

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.420 
basically just going to change your
loading<00:03:55.720> icon<00:03:56.260> in<00:03:56.440> specific<00:03:56.859> places<00:03:56.980> on<00:03:57.310> your

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
loading icon in specific places on your

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.849 
loading icon in specific places on your
device<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.209> most<00:03:58.660> prominent<00:03:59.079> place<00:03:59.380> for

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
device so the most prominent place for

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.259 
device so the most prominent place for
this<00:04:00.040> loading<00:04:00.370> icon<00:04:00.639> is<00:04:00.790> going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.970> be<00:04:01.060> right

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
this loading icon is going to be right

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.699 
this loading icon is going to be right
here<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.540> cydia<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.019> when<00:04:02.139> we<00:04:02.230> open<00:04:02.470> up<00:04:02.530> cydia

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
here in cydia so when we open up cydia

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.530 
here in cydia so when we open up cydia
you're<00:04:03.220> going<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.400> see<00:04:03.609> a<00:04:03.639> loading<00:04:04.209> icon

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
you're going to see a loading icon

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.270 
you're going to see a loading icon
usually<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.200> little<00:04:05.380> dial<00:04:05.769> or

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
usually you get that little dial or

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.110 
usually you get that little dial or
you're<00:04:06.400> not<00:04:06.489> going<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.669> get<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:06.849> anymore

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
you're not going to get that anymore

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.909 
you're not going to get that anymore
you're<00:04:07.299> going<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.480> get<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.750> new<00:04:08.049> theme<00:04:08.709> as

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
you're going to get this new theme as

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.170 
you're going to get this new theme as
you<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:09.190> see<00:04:09.340> right<00:04:09.370> there<00:04:09.760> where<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.150> says

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
you can see right there where it says

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.550 
you can see right there where it says
loading<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.870> then<00:04:11.049> you'll<00:04:11.169> get<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.380> right<00:04:11.410> up

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
loading and then you'll get it right up

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800 
loading and then you'll get it right up
there<00:04:11.859> at<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.040> top<00:04:12.099> as<00:04:12.519> well<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:13.299> mean<00:04:13.630> it's

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
there at the top as well so I mean it's

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.390 
there at the top as well so I mean it's
basically<00:04:13.930> going<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.319> show<00:04:14.500> up<00:04:14.680> anywhere<00:04:15.160> that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
basically going to show up anywhere that

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.210 
basically going to show up anywhere that
you<00:04:15.430> get<00:04:15.759> that<00:04:16.090> loader<00:04:16.630> icon<00:04:17.290> you'll<00:04:17.799> also<00:04:17.949> get

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
you get that loader icon you'll also get

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.650 
you get that loader icon you'll also get
it<00:04:18.340> right<00:04:18.489> up<00:04:18.579> here<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:18.790> your<00:04:18.910> status<00:04:19.150> bar<00:04:19.479> when

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
it right up here in your status bar when

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.180 
it right up here in your status bar when
we

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
we

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.890

can see right here if I swipe over then
we<00:05:37.590> still<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:37.830> most<00:05:38.250> of<00:05:38.430> our<00:05:38.520> icons<00:05:38.970> themed

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
is not an extremely popular app so I

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.290 
is not an extremely popular app so I
wouldn't<00:05:43.950> really<00:05:44.070> expect<00:05:44.160> that<00:05:44.610> to<00:05:44.850> be<00:05:44.880> themed

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.550 
theme really are going to stick out
because<00:05:50.880> they<00:05:51.000> just<00:05:51.210> don't<00:05:51.630> fit<00:05:52.260> in<00:05:52.530> with

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
because they just don't fit in with

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.770 
because they just don't fit in with
everything<00:05:53.070> else<00:05:53.400> but<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:54.510> is<00:05:54.690> still

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
everything else but this is still

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690 
everything else but this is still
definitely<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.290> really<00:05:55.620> nice<00:05:55.890> theme<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.430> I

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
definitely a really nice theme and I

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.770 
definitely a really nice theme and I
would<00:05:56.850> recommend<00:05:56.970> checking<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.630> out

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
would recommend checking it out

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.870 
would recommend checking it out
especially<00:05:58.020> since<00:05:58.530> it's<00:05:58.680> free<00:05:58.980> also<00:05:59.730> if<00:05:59.790> we

especially since it's free also if we

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.040
