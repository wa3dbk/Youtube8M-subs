basically<00:04:38.849> technology<00:04:39.510> works<00:04:40.080> with<00:04:40.320> anything

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
basically technology works with anything

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.939 
basically technology works with anything
that<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.520> display<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.510> visual<00:04:43.320> contents

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
that can display a visual contents

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.400 
that can display a visual contents
that's<00:04:44.610> right<00:04:44.880> now<00:04:45.060> all<00:04:45.270> right<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.690> audio<00:04:46.050> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
that's right now all right and audio and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.399 
that's right now all right and audio and
audio<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:48.270> some<00:04:48.599> of<00:04:48.690> those<00:04:48.750> things<00:04:49.050> we've<00:04:49.229> got

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
audio and some of those things we've got

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.379 
audio and some of those things we've got
coming<00:04:50.099> down<00:04:50.330> on<00:04:51.330> our<00:04:51.690> roadmap<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.470> also<00:04:52.860> do

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
coming down on our roadmap is to also do

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.580 
coming down on our roadmap is to also do
simultaneous<00:04:54.389> exchange<00:04:54.599> of<00:04:54.900> data<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.470> you

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
simultaneous exchange of data so you

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.770 
simultaneous exchange of data so you
could<00:04:55.770> dock<00:04:55.919> your<00:04:56.130> phone<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.150> have<00:04:57.180> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
could dock your phone and have a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.379 
could dock your phone and have a
basically<00:04:58.740> converted<00:04:59.250> into<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.520> PC<00:04:59.940> with<00:05:00.300> a

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
basically converted into a PC with a

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.960 
basically converted into a PC with a
keyboard<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:00.990> mouse<00:05:01.110> in<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.470> display<00:05:01.830> okay

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
keyboard and mouse in a display okay

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.969 
keyboard and mouse in a display okay
and<00:05:03.180> all<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.630> those<00:05:03.780> things<00:05:04.050> were<00:05:04.500> working<00:05:04.680> on

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
and all of those things were working on

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.880 
and all of those things were working on
higher<00:05:05.280> resolution<00:05:06.030> 4k<00:05:06.570> by<00:05:06.810> 2k

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
higher resolution 4k by 2k

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.380 
higher resolution 4k by 2k
and<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:08.460> these<00:05:08.640> things<00:05:08.850> are<00:05:08.970> there<00:05:09.090> today

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
and so on these things are there today

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.300 
and so on these things are there today
with<00:05:09.690> DisplayPort<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.920> it's<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.130> fairly

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
with DisplayPort and so it's a fairly

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.150 
with DisplayPort and so it's a fairly
natural<00:05:11.820> extension<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.500> slim<00:05:13.500> court<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:14.040> be

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
natural extension of slim court to be

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.870 
natural extension of slim court to be
able<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.430> support<00:05:14.700> those<00:05:14.940> things<00:05:15.120> all<00:05:15.720> right

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
able to support those things all right

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.770 
able to support those things all right
all<00:05:17.880> right<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.420> I<00:05:19.050> know<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.010> Nexus<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.550> the

all right so and I know the Nexus is the

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.070 
all right so and I know the Nexus is the
first<00:05:21.780> device<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.220> supports<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:23.600> any<00:05:24.600> idea

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
first device that supports this any idea

laptops<00:06:10.620> that<00:06:12.800> tablets<00:06:13.800> or<00:06:13.890> laptops<00:06:13.920> that

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
laptops that tablets or laptops that

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.750 
laptops that tablets or laptops that
conversion<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:16.080> converts<00:06:16.800> how<00:06:17.370> do<00:06:17.430> you<00:06:17.640> guys

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
conversion and converts how do you guys

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.850 
conversion and converts how do you guys
see<00:06:18.060> that<00:06:18.380> growth<00:06:19.380> for<00:06:19.410> Anna<00:06:20.010> logics<00:06:20.430> yeah

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
see that growth for Anna logics yeah

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.740 
see that growth for Anna logics yeah
well<00:06:22.860> first<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.430> all<00:06:23.550> tablets<00:06:24.000> definitely

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
well first of all tablets definitely

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.630 
well first of all tablets definitely
want<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.080> same<00:06:25.260> functionality<00:06:25.770> yeah<00:06:26.310> so

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
want the same functionality yeah so

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.980 
want the same functionality yeah so
that's<00:06:26.820> an<00:06:26.970> important<00:06:27.480> thing<00:06:27.510> you<00:06:27.720> don't<00:06:27.810> want

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
that's an important thing you don't want

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.420 
that's an important thing you don't want
to<00:06:28.080> add<00:06:28.200> additional<00:06:28.380> connectors<00:06:29.160> to<00:06:29.310> your

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
to add additional connectors to your

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.880 
to add additional connectors to your
tablet<00:06:29.790> because<00:06:29.940> that<00:06:30.090> gets<00:06:30.470> complicated<00:06:31.470> for

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
tablet because that gets complicated for

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.350 
tablet because that gets complicated for
the<00:06:31.950> user<00:06:32.160> as<00:06:32.340> well<00:06:32.370> as<00:06:32.580> for<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.760> manufacturer

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
the user as well as for the manufacturer

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.810 
the user as well as for the manufacturer
yeah<00:06:33.660> so<00:06:34.440> simplifying<00:06:34.920> the<00:06:35.070> connectivity<00:06:35.640> is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
yeah so simplifying the connectivity is

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.550 
yeah so simplifying the connectivity is
a<00:06:35.850> very<00:06:36.180> important<00:06:36.660> thing<00:06:36.840> for<00:06:36.870> tablets<00:06:37.440> and

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
a very important thing for tablets and

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.200 
a very important thing for tablets and
actually<00:06:38.310> this<00:06:38.400> is<00:06:38.550> a<00:06:38.580> perfect<00:06:38.850> solution

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
actually this is a perfect solution

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.230 
actually this is a perfect solution
micro<00:06:40.140> USB<00:06:40.530> is<00:06:40.620> already<00:06:41.040> there<00:06:41.310> on<00:06:41.760> tablets

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
micro USB is already there on tablets

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.580 
micro USB is already there on tablets
both<00:06:42.450> for<00:06:42.720> charging<00:06:43.110> as<00:06:43.200> well<00:06:43.350> as<00:06:43.440> data

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
both for charging as well as data

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.940 
both for charging as well as data
exchanges<00:06:44.280> so<00:06:44.700> making<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.450> do<00:06:46.110> audio<00:06:46.800> and

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
exchanges so making it do audio and

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.400 
exchanges so making it do audio and
video<00:06:47.130> transfer<00:06:47.430> it's<00:06:47.730> just<00:06:47.880> a<00:06:47.970> very<00:06:48.180> natural

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
video transfer it's just a very natural

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.030 
video transfer it's just a very natural
extension<00:06:50.780> we<00:06:51.780> see<00:06:51.990> it<00:06:52.080> coming<00:06:52.440> you<00:06:52.830> know<00:06:52.920> it's

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
extension we see it coming you know it's

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.070 
extension we see it coming you know it's
already<00:06:53.250> there<00:06:53.520> today<00:06:53.880> on<00:06:54.120> all<00:06:54.600> the<00:06:54.750> Apple

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
already there today on all the Apple

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.640 
already there today on all the Apple
devices<00:06:55.350> and<00:06:56.070> they<00:06:56.160> do<00:06:56.220> use<00:06:56.610> display<00:06:57.650> techno

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
devices and they do use display techno

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.400 
devices and they do use display techno
technology<00:06:59.480> it's<00:07:00.480> here<00:07:00.660> now<00:07:00.690> with<00:07:00.990> Android

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
technology it's here now with Android

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.840 
technology it's here now with Android
and<00:07:01.710> it's<00:07:01.860> coming<00:07:02.130> soon<00:07:02.160> with<00:07:02.550> Microsoft<00:07:04.850> now

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
and it's coming soon with Microsoft now

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.040 
and it's coming soon with Microsoft now
what's<00:07:06.120> the<00:07:06.270> difference<00:07:06.660> with<00:07:06.780> your

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
what's the difference with your

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.680 
what's the difference with your
technology<00:07:07.350> and<00:07:07.740> HML<00:07:08.280> I<00:07:08.580> made<00:07:09.120> sure<00:07:09.300> I<00:07:09.450> meant

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
technology and HML I made sure I meant

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
technology and HML I made sure I meant
to<00:07:09.780> say

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
to say

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.270 
to say
keep<00:07:10.860> saying<00:07:11.100> that

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.210 

so<00:07:15.270> basically<00:07:16.140> slim<00:07:16.500> cord<00:07:16.740> allows<00:07:16.950> you<00:07:17.100> to

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
so basically slim cord allows you to

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.520 
so basically slim cord allows you to
send<00:07:17.430> 1080p<00:07:18.090> at<00:07:18.270> 60<00:07:18.630> Hertz<00:07:18.660> yeah<00:07:19.140> that's<00:07:19.320> kind

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
send 1080p at 60 Hertz yeah that's kind

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.200 
send 1080p at 60 Hertz yeah that's kind
of<00:07:19.590> the<00:07:19.710> first<00:07:19.980> main<00:07:20.430> difference<00:07:20.850> is<00:07:21.000> that<00:07:21.030> the

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
of the first main difference is that the

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.730 
of the first main difference is that the
resolution<00:07:21.480> is<00:07:21.840> much<00:07:21.990> higher<00:07:22.200> but<00:07:22.620> it's

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
resolution is much higher but it's

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.730 
resolution is much higher but it's
actually<00:07:23.010> twice

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
actually twice

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.620 
actually twice
compared<00:07:25.740> with<00:07:25.770> MHL<00:07:26.370> the<00:07:26.940> second<00:07:27.270> thing<00:07:27.450> is

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
compared with MHL the second thing is

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.520 
compared with MHL the second thing is
with<00:07:28.230> MHL<00:07:28.830> you<00:07:29.190> must<00:07:29.640> have<00:07:29.970> this<00:07:30.240> power<00:07:31.170> source

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530 
with MHL you must have this power source

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.960 
with MHL you must have this power source
available<00:07:31.980> which<00:07:32.130> is<00:07:32.250> kind<00:07:32.460> of<00:07:32.520> inconvenient

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
available which is kind of inconvenient

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.090 
available which is kind of inconvenient
cuz<00:07:33.270> you<00:07:33.390> need<00:07:33.540> to<00:07:33.600> find<00:07:34.440> the<00:07:34.560> power<00:07:34.740> source

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
cuz you need to find the power source

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.190 
cuz you need to find the power source
and<00:07:35.310> connect<00:07:35.610> it<00:07:35.790> if<00:07:36.300> you<00:07:36.510> don't<00:07:36.690> do<00:07:36.870> that<00:07:36.990> you

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.200 
and connect it if you don't do that you

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.680 
and connect it if you don't do that you
get<00:07:37.290> no<00:07:37.470> audio<00:07:37.800> and<00:07:38.070> no<00:07:38.190> video<00:07:38.400> in<00:07:39.150> the<00:07:39.300> case<00:07:39.480> of

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
get no audio and no video in the case of

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.150 
get no audio and no video in the case of
some<00:07:39.900> point<00:07:40.110> it<00:07:40.200> works<00:07:40.380> with<00:07:40.560> and<00:07:40.740> without<00:07:40.860> it

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 
some point it works with and without it

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.490 
some point it works with and without it
so<00:07:41.310> it's<00:07:41.430> very<00:07:41.790> flexible<00:07:42.090> and<00:07:42.570> then<00:07:43.140> the<00:07:43.290> third

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
so it's very flexible and then the third

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.110 
so it's very flexible and then the third
key<00:07:43.740> difference<00:07:44.130> is<00:07:44.220> the<00:07:44.370> ability<00:07:44.580> to<00:07:44.760> connect

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
key difference is the ability to connect

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.140 
key difference is the ability to connect
to<00:07:45.180> any<00:07:45.570> display<00:07:46.290> type<00:07:46.530> so<00:07:46.740> here's<00:07:46.950> a<00:07:47.150> vga

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
to any display type so here's a vga

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.020 
to any display type so here's a vga
connector<00:07:48.720> and<00:07:49.350> it<00:07:49.470> can<00:07:49.650> not<00:07:50.460> be<00:07:50.640> done<00:07:50.760> easily

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030 
connector and it can not be done easily

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.700 
connector and it can not be done easily
with<00:07:51.240> MHL<00:07:51.810> because<00:07:52.020> again<00:07:52.260> you<00:07:52.440> need<00:07:52.560> that

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710 
with MHL because again you need that

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.360 
with MHL because again you need that
extra<00:07:53.070> power<00:07:53.430> cable<00:07:53.940> and<00:07:54.620> you<00:07:55.620> know<00:07:55.710> it's<00:07:55.860> very

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.370 
extra power cable and you know it's very

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.560 
extra power cable and you know it's very
complicated<00:07:56.880> to<00:07:57.360> do<00:07:57.480> with<00:07:57.630> MHL<00:07:59.480> thank<00:08:00.480> you

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.570 
complicated to do with MHL thank you

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:09.770 
complicated to do with MHL thank you
very<00:08:00.720> much<00:08:00.900> okay<00:08:01.440> what<00:08:01.770> activated

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.840 

you
