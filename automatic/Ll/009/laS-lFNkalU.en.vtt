Hey guys~

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.899
Today I want to show you something real quick.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.833
It's a Flying Minecart Mod that you can install in 
your world.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:22.299
There is only one command block needed.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.100
The design is originally made by jfKimberly and 
Sporknoggin.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.533
I just compacted it up to fit in one single 
command.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.199
To install it in your world is very straightforward

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.166
Just give yourself a command block.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.566
Copy the command which I have put in the 
description.

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.066
Paste it into the command block.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.432
Then activate it.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.766
Right-click the left sign you will get the minecart

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:56.299
Right-click the right sign to Enable / Disable the 
mod anytime you want 

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.533
Flying the minecart is really simple

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.533
It just goes to the direction that you are pointing

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.433
Look up to ascend

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:14.533
Look down to descend

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.533
It goes wherever you want it to go

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.433
Right-click the sign again to disable the mod.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:41.833
Right-click the red sign to uninstall the mod.

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.466
Thanks For Watching!
