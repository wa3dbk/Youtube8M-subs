 surveys and that's how the accounts came out 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.530

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.220
 the polls and if I got the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.650
 good accounts I think this count in 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.480
 what would happen if your game 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.170
 favorite was on the list because I 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.480

 that end and it's fatal my father went out to

 console it was better to spend whole months 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.000
 improving my control I ended it in the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.019
 maximum level with each character and to play 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.620
