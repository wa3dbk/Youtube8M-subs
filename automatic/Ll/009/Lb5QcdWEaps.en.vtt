from basketball beasts and what he said

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
from basketball beasts and what he said
was<00:00:19.609> he's<00:00:20.609> basically<00:00:20.939> talking<00:00:21.390> about<00:00:21.539> his

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
was he's basically talking about his

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269 
was he's basically talking about his
game<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.740> skill<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.220> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
game like I have this skill and that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
game like I have this skill and that
skill<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:24.000> coach<00:00:24.210> doesn't<00:00:24.539> want<00:00:24.779> me<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
skill but my coach doesn't want me to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839
