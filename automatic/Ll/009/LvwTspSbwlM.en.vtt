00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.940
 welcome net nas you will both already see chile 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.100
 certainly a new video in which 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.619
 will seal a good application this time is 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.030
 a very fun and entertaining game in 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.420
 the one that we will have to kill zombies with a 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.420
 car 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 the game zombie steals trip is a game 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.070
 pretty funny entertaining and even 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.380
 affordable for any terminal since 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 it does not have very amazing graphics 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.970
 but enough to enjoy a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 great quality in which apart from being able 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.870
 enjoy this quality the game is 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 quite affordable and fun and we're going to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
 we had to give him a ride to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 start playing twice the first time 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 would be to choose between receiving these 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 four options to give us more life or 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 have a nitro poster or get 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.470
 a new currency for each zone and that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.210
 let's kill if we do not want any, not the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.770
 we bought would cost us at the price that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.720
 we would put down here the next one that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.880
 we would have in total we go to the network that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.640
 it would be to drive it and for example 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.300
 I have customized myself to have this laser 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 how do you see this red pointer that would be 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.979
 to aim with higher quality and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.450
 precision is not that it serves much 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.670
 but it is a pimp and might 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
 also customize all our car 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.980
 what to say is a game also very 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.750
 customizable 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.270
 the game has a very controls 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.210
 simple the car goes alone as you can 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.550
 check and we have a series of buttons 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.410
 to 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.350
 lower right on the left 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.880
 bottom of the mobile where it would be for 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 turn to the left or to the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.740
 right if we hold for a period 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 of short time so now in a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.090
 repeat what I teach you see it we keep and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.860
 we can go around and do this 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 turn or looking like we want to call it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.160
 it would give us more experience in the bar 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 from above to get a nitro for 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.520
 get nitro and let us go more 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.500
 fast and we can go up and do more 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.620
 meters that more meters equals more 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.180
 coins and coins to more weapons more 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.870
 cars and more of everything if we have bad not 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.820
 It would be slower mode and the car 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.670
 otherwise we could catch the horde before 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.680
 of zombies that comes from behind every 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.760
 Once we move to a different town what 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.280
 we can do is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.769
 earn more score and get more 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 speed and a little bit of time to 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.329
 recover from the growth of 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.069
 zombies as you see I have been able to overcome 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.260
 the first fairly simple villages 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.799
 but you get not flight a level so 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.450
 say it is quite complicated if 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.860
 we killed these types of birds that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.079
 they carry like paper that would be called 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.959
 lottery would be for then how does the 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.129
 game can get 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.220
 more more zombie coins in a way 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.070
 much simpler 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 Also, as you can see, it seemed like a 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.220
 little sign down there in which 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.990
 would mean that they are a series of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.530
 missions that they have to get more 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.770
 money and as you say down here I have 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.320
 three and a little star that would be 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.150
 the tickets and the lottery that got 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.710
 killing three different birds of that 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.600
 and here would be the missions of the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.190
 sciences types divisions we're going to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.220
 continue and lottery we would have to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.410
 make turns 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.860
 to give us a type of lottery or in a 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.340
 type of prize in which he would haul from 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.560
 the 500 from the five hundred coins 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.640
 up to ten coins and if we do not want 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.530
 do that what we could do 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.720
 it would simply be to go to the bottom 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.500
 and give casting that would be like selling 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.610
 what of that ticket for 25 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.230
 coins I recommend that you do it already 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.000
 that you lose nothing and surely 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.140
 get a much higher prize to 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.870
 25 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.240
 and now I'm going to show you what is the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 different characteristics that it has of 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.160
 construction this game 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.800
 we could choose this type of cars that 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.330
 they could be even unbeatable 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.940
 weapons mean weapons in English and 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.530
 we could choose everything if you are from a 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.410
 pistolite we can also get 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.450
 gadgets that would be like improvements and 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.010
 advantages that the game would give them 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.390
 we could improve and everything if it has 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.940
 liked this game and you're going to try it 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.260
 you never have to leave your likes and if not 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.209
 you are going to try and you have not liked it yet 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.920
 10a dislike but if in the case 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.230
 of Claire, I would like you to leave me 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.959
 because you left me if the likes 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.340
 so if they want referees like this one or 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.630
 even better 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.890
 subscribe to this has been all for 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.890
 us in a next video
