00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 she was 25 beauty 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 Welcome to another video of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.170
 channel my android tozzo 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 It's in this video I want to make a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.359
 presentation of the 20 dp of the e 612 of the country 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.310
 thailand 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.700
 in fact it's more a staff review 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.880
 despite this fine and a lot of difference from the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.290
 others but the difference more in question 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.219
 of performance 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.000
 so if you are thinking of upgrading 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.960
 your great 75 for android 4.1.2 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 or if you have already updated but are not 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.110
 enjoying the performance of your device 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.320
 You think he's catching too much. 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 So this is great and I use it from the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.470
 The day I find out I've put other 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 But she's very good, this street that I 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.630
 I use to make the videos here on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.330
 channel to teach how to do the last 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 through an app fame useful until 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 because only this street is compatible with 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.509
 version 1.4.2 the application is rude 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.689
 so I 'll show you here for you to have 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:34.770
 software information 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:40.290
 in this line he is bad of this 112 is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.360
 here if conference is the fmb version and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.490
 thailand 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.790
 usually the tutorials and channels that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.060
 I see on the internet they teach how you 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.180
 is placing at 12 610 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.280
 But why do not you pick it up like that? 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.869
 However, the 110 in a device is 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.799
 International 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.380
 it is not the case of the mold in case it goes 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.490
 available in the countries 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.560
 developed 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.110
 he will have and nfc and so he finds a 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.260
 little more than Greek battery and why 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.770
 he gets there looking for nfc signal there 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.050
 things and ours and 112 efects 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.880
 he does not have it and generally the staff 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.200
 around there is the street 12 610 it works 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.000
 but I did some tests I already tested all 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.270
 from 20a to 20g which is one of the most 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.290
 recent that came out and I really liked it 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.790
 was this 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 So I decided to talk about it so I 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.350
 I will also leave the video description the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.510
 tutorial link where teaching as 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.340
 Download it there and like the diyala 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.890
 so I'll talk a little about it already 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.700
 You already understood she will not change. 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.450
 nor of the other beauty 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.770
 only that it will have more reforms like 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:27.660
 you find out if the frog your device is and 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:33.230
 612 or 610 of f110 simple here in 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:39.690
 status bar on the taskbar here 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 will have nfc iraq beauty and this 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.910
 Do not have this device, you do not have to 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.360
 this device is simple 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.780
 just reminding people that I am 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.500
 doing this refill is from the street to the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:01.740
 model for the 112 r is not for 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:05.670
 oe 615 is for 812 and coming back 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.690
 He's very light, I'm here recording. 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.000
 here the video is at maximum of if you 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.600
 wonder to record screen video on 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.850
 your smartphone already has a video here on 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.550
 channel teaches you how to do this 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.590
 So you look in the channel and you 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.810
 find it you can also record 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.650
 Son, do you want to show your friends? 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:34.960
 games and such an increase is very light 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.950
 she does not have that nfc search engine that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 I think he's very drunk and he's 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.480
 she knows the simplest model 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:52.360
 it will be that it uses less space and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:58.630
 I'll show her here she 's wearing 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.990
 here she is using 191 in 111 free 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:09.970
 but with some settings I make 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:13.510
 and I always leave between 180 and 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.500
 220 he may arrive but he is in the 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.600
 free memory 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.810
 so this is good for what games 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.610
 for heavier applications with 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:29.490
 some other applications as well 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:33.250
 staff so this is even this video 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.230
 I do not have much to explain the 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.560
 speak it is very light I'm here 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:41.110
 recording the video in the resolution but 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.020
 my device supports and it is not 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:51.160
 catching a lot is fluid 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:53.050
 maybe if it was another 1 would do well 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.990
 battery that I have been for some time 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.260
 recording and I do not like it very much 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.940
 so I really like this one detail 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:07.900
 when you want to install the 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.060
 Bad start device get a little 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.880
 heavy 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.990
 What happens is that when Osmar 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.080
 family 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:23.880
 it takes time for the 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.880
 abrÃ£o applications and it can is you 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.889
 performance ratio in order to be 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.659
 beauty staff functions 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:35.960
 that's when you'll like the video 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.960
 even Czech and until the next video
