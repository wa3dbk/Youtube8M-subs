00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
video I suppose so here here now I'll

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.370 
video I suppose so here here now I'll
show<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.780> where<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:32.960> goes<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:35.200> okay

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
show you where it goes to okay

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.890 
show you where it goes to okay
so<00:01:36.770> which<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.000> are<00:01:38.119> here<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.479> River<00:01:38.690> wood

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
so which we are here in River wood

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.140 
so which we are here in River wood
actually<00:01:39.310> that's<00:01:40.310> pretty<00:01:40.550> close<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.940> where<00:01:41.030> it

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
actually that's pretty close to where it

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.109 
actually that's pretty close to where it
is<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.650> treasure<00:01:42.920> map<00:01:43.160> actually<00:01:44.000> has

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
is for the the treasure map actually has

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.700 
is for the the treasure map actually has
an<00:01:44.270> image<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.780> River<00:01:45.080> word<00:01:45.260> on<00:01:45.410> it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
an image of River word on it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.690 
an image of River word on it
so<00:01:46.100> treasure<00:01:46.400> map<00:01:46.610> one

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so treasure map one

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
so treasure map one
I<00:01:47.789> don't<00:01:48.539> know<00:01:48.659> who<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.530> no<00:01:49.619> I
