handheld<00:00:07.980> version<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> console<00:00:09.120> version

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
handheld version and the console version

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.330 
handheld version and the console version
a<00:00:10.019> lot<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.410> people<00:00:10.500> seem<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.040> getting<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a lot of people seem to be getting the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.640 
a lot of people seem to be getting the
two<00:00:11.460> confused<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.210> each<00:00:12.330> other<00:00:12.540> um<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:13.440> for

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
two confused with each other um as for

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.259 
two confused with each other um as for
the<00:00:13.740> handheld<00:00:14.040> version<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.089> looks

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the handheld version I think it looks

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.980 
the handheld version I think it looks
okay<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:16.400> is<00:00:17.400> neat<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> see<00:00:17.940> dimps<00:00:18.480> venture<00:00:18.869> out

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
okay I is neat to see dimps venture out

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.120 
okay I is neat to see dimps venture out
of<00:00:19.080> their<00:00:19.199> comfort<00:00:19.350> zone<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.710> make<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
of their comfort zone to make like a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.450 
of their comfort zone to make like a
fully<00:00:20.430> 3d<00:00:20.850> game<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:22.020> least<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.949> stages

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fully 3d game at least in some stages

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.089 
fully 3d game at least in some stages
the<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.060> stage<00:00:24.510> well<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.010> see

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the first stage well from what I can see

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.730 
the first stage well from what I can see
the<00:00:26.369> gameplay<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.029> looks<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.740> really

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the gameplay just looks really really

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.529 
the gameplay just looks really really
sluggish<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.390> definitely

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
sluggish I think that I'm definitely

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.209 
sluggish I think that I'm definitely
going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> prefer<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> console<00:00:31.769> version<00:00:31.800> just

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
going to prefer the console version just

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.620 
going to prefer the console version just
because<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> looks<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.030> easier<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because it looks like it's easier to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.950 
because it looks like it's easier to
move<00:00:33.750> around<00:00:33.899> us<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.370> not<00:00:35.660> but<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
move around us on them or not but it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
move around us on them or not but it
looks<00:00:37.170> okay<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.430> neat<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
looks okay I do think it's neat that you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
looks okay I do think it's neat that you
can<00:00:38.910> apparently<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> element<00:00:40.050> shields

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
can apparently use the element shields

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.740 
can apparently use the element shields
in<00:00:40.590> 3d<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> game<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.420> looks<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
in 3d in this game it looks like the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
in 3d in this game it looks like the
wisps<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> appear<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> console

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
wisps are going to appear in the console

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.709 
wisps are going to appear in the console
version<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> handheld<00:00:45.300> version<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
version and the handheld version is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.119 
version and the handheld version is
gonna<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> yellow<00:00:46.320> mushy<00:00:46.680> oh<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.950> they're

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
gonna get the yellow mushy oh so they're

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
gonna get the yellow mushy oh so they're
going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> make<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.120> different

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going to kind of make it a different

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to kind of make it a different
experience<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.440> each<00:00:50.070> version<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> game

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
experience with each version of the game

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.540 
experience with each version of the game
as<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> next<00:00:53.070> stage<00:00:53.280> oh<00:00:54.530> boy<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.980> actually

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
as for the next stage oh boy I actually

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
as for the next stage oh boy I actually
don't<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.239> stage<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.600> much<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
don't like this stage that much at all I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
don't like this stage that much at all I
just<00:00:58.710> made<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> video<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> sonic<00:01:00.000> x<00:01:00.120> to

just made a video for the sonic x to
this<00:01:00.359> project<00:01:00.600> talking<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.289> platforming

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this project talking about platforming

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
this project talking about platforming
and<00:01:02.010> whatnot<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.520> how<00:01:02.640> ya<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.629> needs<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> be

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and whatnot on how ya there needs to be

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
and whatnot on how ya there needs to be
a<00:01:04.049> balance<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.280> things<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a balance of it with other things it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.429 
a balance of it with other things it
can't<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.390> who<00:01:06.659> drools<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.049> oodles<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
can't just be who drools and oodles of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.899 
can't just be who drools and oodles of
platforming<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.100> slows<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.729> mean

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
platforming or slows you down I mean

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.140 
platforming or slows you down I mean
honestly<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> reminds<00:01:10.470> me<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
honestly this kind of reminds me of a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
honestly this kind of reminds me of a
here's<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> put<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.110> send<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here's how I put it this is send up a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
here's how I put it this is send up a
list<00:01:13.979> light<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.330> i<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.920> ok<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:17.850> don't

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
list light and i think is ok but i don't

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
list light and i think is ok but i don't
i<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.479> far<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.810> great<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
i think it's far from great and this

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.130 
i think it's far from great and this
just<00:01:20.040> makes<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.060> i<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.780> i'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
just makes me more sure that i think i'm

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
just makes me more sure that i think i'm
gonna<00:01:22.290> give<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> handheld<00:01:23.280> version<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.790> pass

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gonna give the handheld version a pass

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.359 
gonna give the handheld version a pass
it<00:01:24.330> looks<00:01:24.540> ok<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> call<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> bad

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
it looks ok i don't want to call it bad

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.999 
it looks ok i don't want to call it bad
I<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> looks<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.840> clunky<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
I just think it looks really clunky and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.539 
I just think it looks really clunky and
sluggish<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.259> cannibal<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.829> let's<00:01:32.430> talk

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
sluggish and cannibal and so let's talk

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
sluggish and cannibal and so let's talk
about<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> console<00:01:33.180> version<00:01:33.210> ok<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> console

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
about the console version ok the console

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.580 
version from the three stages they've
shown<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.869> some<00:01:36.990> things<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
shown there are some things I really

really<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> some

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
really really like about it and some

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.690 
really really like about it and some
things<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> bug<00:01:40.619> me<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
things that kind of bug me I think it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600 
things that kind of bug me I think it
looks<00:01:41.729> good<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.470> great<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.520> again

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
looks good but not great but think again

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
looks good but not great but think again
we've<00:01:44.939> only<00:01:45.090> seen<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> beginning<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we've only seen the beginning of the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
we've only seen the beginning of the
game<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.159> expect<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> entire<00:01:47.909> game

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
game and I don't expect the entire game

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
game and I don't expect the entire game
to<00:01:48.329> play<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> same<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> here's<00:01:49.350> why<00:01:49.619> okay

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to play the same and here's why okay

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
to play the same and here's why okay
first<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:50.909> talk<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.450> opening<00:01:51.960> stage

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
first let's talk about the opening stage

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
first let's talk about the opening stage
windy<00:01:52.710> hill<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.119> place<00:01:54.390> looks

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
windy hill I think this place looks

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
windy hill I think this place looks
pretty<00:01:54.840> cool<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.439> we've<00:01:55.560> seen<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
pretty cool and now that we've seen the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.359 
pretty cool and now that we've seen the
entire<00:01:56.009> stage<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.380> say<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.950> does<00:01:59.130> look

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
entire stage and I can say it does look

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069 
entire stage and I can say it does look
more<00:01:59.549> satisfying<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> play<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.750> modern

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
more satisfying to play than modern

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.870 
more satisfying to play than modern
green<00:02:01.380> hill<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.740> Sonic<00:02:02.070> Generations<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
green hill from Sonic Generations this

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
green hill from Sonic Generations this
does<00:02:03.149> look<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.659> better<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.170> stage

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
does look like a better first stage

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
does look like a better first stage
there's<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.490> many<00:02:05.670> paths<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.509> clumped

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
there's so many paths just clumped

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229 
there's so many paths just clumped
together<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
together and like you do it get to you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.080 
together and like you do it get to you
as<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> wisp<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:09.989> point<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.910> don't

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
as a wisp at one point but a you don't

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.300 
as a wisp at one point but a you don't
seem<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
seem to have to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
seem to have to
at<00:02:13.580> all<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:14.030> there's<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.450> many<00:02:14.569> paths<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
at all like there's so many paths to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.460 
at all like there's so many paths to
take<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> wisps<00:02:16.250> presence<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.000> pretty

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
take but the wisps presence is pretty

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.420 
take but the wisps presence is pretty
superfluous<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.770> would<00:02:18.890> hardly<00:02:19.040> call<00:02:19.220> this

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
superfluous I would hardly call this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.520 
superfluous I would hardly call this
Sonic<00:02:19.940> Colors<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.720> some<00:02:20.930> people<00:02:21.170> were

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
Sonic Colors to like some people were

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.979 
Sonic Colors to like some people were
worried<00:02:21.860> about<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.250> being<00:02:22.430> um<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.599> like<00:02:23.900> that

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
worried about it being um I like that

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.000 
worried about it being um I like that
they're<00:02:24.140> bringing<00:02:24.410> back<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> lot<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.920> things

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
they're bringing back a lot of things

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.650 
they're bringing back a lot of things
from<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.280> classic<00:02:25.670> games<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.270> spinning

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
from the classic games like the spinning

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.330 
from the classic games like the spinning
log<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.140> spikes<00:02:27.440> on<00:02:27.680> them<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
log with spikes on them and the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.360 
log with spikes on them and the
crumbling<00:02:28.790> terrain<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.450> well<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.980> think

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
crumbling terrain and well I do think

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.680 
crumbling terrain and well I do think
they<00:02:31.459> are<00:02:31.580> actually<00:02:31.880> taking<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.420> little<00:02:32.569> too

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
they are actually taking it a little too

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.660 
they are actually taking it a little too
far<00:02:33.080> because<00:02:33.260> they're<00:02:33.500> using<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.370> many

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
far because they're using so many

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.940 
far because they're using so many
badniks<00:02:35.330> but<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.569> do<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.260> way<00:02:36.530> some<00:02:36.590> of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
badniks but I do like the way some of

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.620 
badniks but I do like the way some of
them<00:02:37.099> are<00:02:37.220> being<00:02:37.430> implemented<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:38.000> 3d<00:02:38.360> like

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
them are being implemented in 3d like

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.050 
them are being implemented in 3d like
that<00:02:38.810> snail<00:02:39.200> enemy<00:02:39.590> from<00:02:39.860> launch<00:02:40.220> base<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.730> like

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
that snail enemy from launch base I like

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.380 
that snail enemy from launch base I like
how<00:02:41.269> they<00:02:41.510> function<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:43.760> thing<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.000> kind

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
how they function here one thing I kind

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.610 
how they function here one thing I kind
of<00:02:44.420> wish<00:02:44.569> they<00:02:44.720> didn't<00:02:44.959> include<00:02:45.170> where<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
of wish they didn't include where the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.539 
of wish they didn't include where the
round<00:02:46.069> checkered<00:02:46.940> cannons<00:02:47.480> from<00:02:47.750> oil<00:02:48.200> lotion

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
round checkered cannons from oil lotion

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.070 
round checkered cannons from oil lotion
just<00:02:49.549> because<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.790> never<00:02:50.510> really<00:02:50.810> liked<00:02:51.049> that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
just because I never really liked that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.780 
just because I never really liked that
gimmick<00:02:51.530> because<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.799> area<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.280> give<00:02:52.459> give

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
gimmick because the area so to give give

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
gimmick because the area so to give give
up<00:02:52.940> control<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.630> game<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.290> ten

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
up control of the game for like ten

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.020 
up control of the game for like ten
seconds<00:02:54.980> while<00:02:55.130> they<00:02:55.220> show<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> next

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
seconds while they show you to the next

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
seconds while they show you to the next
to<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.150> next<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.569> next<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.080> well<00:02:57.709> we

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
to the next to the next and well we

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.020 
to the next to the next and well we
apparently<00:02:58.310> see<00:02:58.790> those<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.769> anyway<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:01.910> a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
apparently see those here anyway it's a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.000 
apparently see those here anyway it's a
good<00:03:02.209> first<00:03:02.480> zone<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:03.200> just<00:03:03.410> got<00:03:03.590> some<00:03:03.799> bits

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
good first zone it's just got some bits

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.589 
good first zone it's just got some bits
that<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.220> kind<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.730> wish<00:03:04.910> weren't<00:03:05.150> there<00:03:05.390> but

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
that I kind of wish weren't there but

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.910 
that I kind of wish weren't there but
whatever<00:03:05.989> i'm<00:03:06.230> pretty<00:03:06.500> sure<00:03:06.650> i'll<00:03:06.769> enjoy

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
whatever i'm pretty sure i'll enjoy

stages<00:03:10.630> well<00:03:11.630> okay<00:03:12.230> here's<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.099> thing<00:03:13.250> i<00:03:13.340> like

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
stages well okay here's one thing i like

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.130 
stages well okay here's one thing i like
about<00:03:13.549> i<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.269> each<00:03:14.480> stage<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
about i like that each stage is

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.229 
about i like that each stage is
something<00:03:15.610> completely<00:03:16.610> different<00:03:16.880> from<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
something completely different from the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.180 
something completely different from the
last<00:03:17.390> one<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.810> expected<00:03:18.470> each<00:03:18.590> stage<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.980> kind

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
last one I expected each stage to kind

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.800 
last one I expected each stage to kind
of<00:03:19.250> play<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.549> same<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.060> I'll<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.180> beyond

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
of play the same so I'll just beyond

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.830 
of play the same so I'll just beyond
these<00:03:20.959> tubes<00:03:21.380> but<00:03:22.280> while<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.060> don't<00:03:23.570> think<00:03:23.750> I'm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
these tubes but while I don't think I'm

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
these tubes but while I don't think I'm
going<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> like<00:03:24.290> every<00:03:24.709> single<00:03:25.040> stage<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.549> do

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
going to like every single stage I do

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.800 
going to like every single stage I do
appreciate<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.329> they're<00:03:26.420> trying<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.720> make

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
not really passing judgment on the game

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.900

they're<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.380> keep<00:03:33.620> making<00:03:33.859> each

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
they're going to keep making each

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
different stage we see you know just

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.340 
different stage we see you know just
something<00:03:37.519> different<00:03:37.910> something<00:03:38.299> new<00:03:38.450> that's

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
not going to be like the previous stage

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.059 
not going to be like the previous stage
before<00:03:41.510> it's<00:03:41.959> just<00:03:42.170> going<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.680> be<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.859> game

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
before it's just going to be a game

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.280 
before it's just going to be a game

chemical<00:03:48.530> plant<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.130> game<00:03:49.370> you're<00:03:49.549> just

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
chemical plant of this game you're just

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.000 
chemical plant of this game you're just
careening<00:03:50.120> forward<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.989> whatnot<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:51.680> it

looks kind of cool i do like seeing
these<00:03:54.500> fleets<00:03:55.100> of<00:03:55.280> all<00:03:55.430> these<00:03:55.549> bendix<00:03:56.000> just

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
these fleets of all these bendix just

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.210 
these fleets of all these bendix just
flying<00:03:56.540> around<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.260> makes<00:03:57.410> for<00:03:57.560> some<00:03:57.709> cool<00:03:57.920> set

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
flying around it makes for some cool set

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.170 
flying around it makes for some cool set
pieces<00:03:58.810> as<00:03:59.810> for<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.139> candy<00:04:00.530> level<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.100> get<00:04:02.030> it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
pieces as for the candy level I get it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.750 
pieces as for the candy level I get it
it's<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.569> 2d<00:04:02.989> centric<00:04:03.500> stage<00:04:03.799> we're<00:04:04.519> mainly

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
it's a 2d centric stage we're mainly

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.460 
it's a 2d centric stage we're mainly
just<00:04:04.880> here<00:04:05.090> look<00:04:05.299> at<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.480> nice<00:04:05.660> backgrounds

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
just here look at the nice backgrounds

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.789 
just here look at the nice backgrounds
and<00:04:06.650> platforming<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.459> okay<00:04:08.109> again<00:04:09.109> just<00:04:09.350> it

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
and platforming is okay again just it

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.110 
and platforming is okay again just it
doesn't<00:04:09.920> look<00:04:10.130> like<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.340> stage<00:04:10.639> that<00:04:10.670> I'm<00:04:10.880> gonna

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
doesn't look like a stage that I'm gonna

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.990 
doesn't look like a stage that I'm gonna
be<00:04:11.989> nearly<00:04:12.200> as<00:04:12.410> invested<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.130> say<00:04:13.370> windy

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
be nearly as invested in I say windy

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.240 
be nearly as invested in I say windy
hill<00:04:14.209> just<00:04:14.660> because<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.109> went<00:04:15.440> fully<00:04:15.769> 3d

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
hill just because I went fully 3d

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.159 
hill just because I went fully 3d
gameplay<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:16.940> want<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> look<00:04:17.840> for<00:04:18.049> things

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
gameplay and I want to look for things

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.399 
gameplay and I want to look for things
but<00:04:19.039> it's<00:04:19.519> okay<00:04:20.030> like<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.750> said<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.169> at<00:04:21.289> least

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
but it's okay like I said it at least

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.500 
but it's okay like I said it at least
each<00:04:21.979> new<00:04:22.400> stay<00:04:22.700> seems<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.150> be<00:04:23.270> something

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
each new stay seems to be something

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.260 
each new stay seems to be something
different<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:25.640> we<00:04:25.849> can't<00:04:26.120> really

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
different so you know we can't really

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.040 
different so you know we can't really
predict<00:04:26.690> what's<00:04:26.840> going

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
predict what's going

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.600 
predict what's going
happen<00:04:27.409> next<00:04:27.650> I'm<00:04:27.860> sure<00:04:28.039> we're<00:04:28.190> going<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.460> be

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
happen next I'm sure we're going to be

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.490 
happen next I'm sure we're going to be
surprised<00:04:29.090> again<00:04:29.270> again<00:04:29.810> again<00:04:29.960> by<00:04:30.259> whatever

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
surprised again again again by whatever

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.520 
surprised again again again by whatever
they<00:04:30.800> show<00:04:30.979> next<00:04:31.250> time<00:04:31.930> how<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:32.960> said<00:04:33.500> I

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
they show next time how that said I

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.409 
they show next time how that said I
don't<00:04:33.860> really<00:04:34.009> see<00:04:34.129> what<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:34.699> level<00:04:35.180> and

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
don't really see what this level and

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.839 
don't really see what this level and
this<00:04:35.659> level<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.379> this<00:04:36.979> will<00:04:37.280> really<00:04:37.550> have<00:04:37.819> to

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
this level and this will really have to

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.580 
this level and this will really have to
do<00:04:38.120> with<00:04:38.270> each<00:04:38.389> other<00:04:38.569> i'm<00:04:38.840> pretty<00:04:39.080> sure<00:04:39.319> this

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
do with each other i'm pretty sure this

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.890 
do with each other i'm pretty sure this
level<00:04:40.069> was<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.490> from<00:04:40.699> the<00:04:40.819> forest<00:04:41.330> area<00:04:41.690> and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
level was just from the forest area and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.930 
level was just from the forest area and
they<00:04:42.020> accidentally<00:04:42.979> threw<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.550> with<00:04:43.580> it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
they accidentally threw it in with it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.309
