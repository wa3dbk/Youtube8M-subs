00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.970
 sad story samba at the beginning of the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.340
 70s there were many people fighting 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.560
 for a different country so there's no 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.390
 poverty so that we all have the right 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.140
 to education to work but 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.300
 unfortunately they were persecuted in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.880
 1976 a group of military took to the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.290
 democratic government and took power by 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.260
 the force then 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.840
 the dictators used all the power of the 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.450
 been to capture those who thought 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 different student workers 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.800
 guerrilla intellectual merchants 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.400
 artists parents and mothers many of them 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.710
 pregnant 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.050

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 little ones took them off and they 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.550
 other families gave them 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.790
 they invented new names and so they 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.310
 they assured that they never knew the truth 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.700
 they were stolen more if it's a child that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.040
 knows all that is called appropriation and it's 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.740
 a crime not only kidnapped their 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.110
 parents but they took away their children 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.970
 the right to identity and how 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.160

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.610
 grandmothers we fight to find 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.750
 our grandchildren that were appropriate 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.600
 by other families illegally 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
 they met after many 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.270
 years of searching and research we 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.860

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.400
 plaza de mayo 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.740
 telling this samba story we should 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.280
 make our grandchildren know their 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 True identity 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.959

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.080
 never again violates the right to 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.830
 identity of any child in the country or 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.830
 in the world 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.439
 our grandchildren are already over 30 years old 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.709
 but we are still here and not 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:20.610
 we lose hope of finding them 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.970
 hug them and maybe meet their children 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.910
