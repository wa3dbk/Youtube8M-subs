inverse<00:02:10.569> shadow<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.140> actually<00:02:11.620> useless<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
inverse shadow is actually useless and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.880 
inverse shadow is actually useless and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
infusion is pretty close to it so if

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.559
