00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 you the viewers videos of the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.190
 people 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.770
 Look 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.210
 to me when I see these images always 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.350
 It strikes me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.660
 noise 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.750
 caused by water and the force of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.750
 Water 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.020
 if a box gives 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.450
 another one of the images this morning 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.520
 good about panamericana there was so 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.080
 least there in Pan-American exams ten 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.790
 cars that had been stranded with 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.600
 beacons for at least one hour 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 without anyone being towed without a cone 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 navalist assigns a warning and this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.000
 that is a common with him also not with a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.250
 subsoil does not look like one of a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.700
 parking of a building or the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.049
 entry 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.049
 below and a car 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 clear as a hall at the exit the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.990
 forgiveness on the street is the way out from the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.939
 hall of the building 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.939
 which marks how far the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:37.020
 time in the morning we are in the air 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 I already saw this 5 or 6 in the morning 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.200
 [Music] 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.240
 and the other car that was not seen until 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.030
 that are being guarded 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.810
 we still did not know there was a stick 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.000
 collective 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.000
 the car did not even see the floor 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.280
 and as we say the areas of always 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.710
 we know them memory 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.020
 now there was there was an alert 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.939
 meteorological because there was no defense 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.500
 civilian to prevent this situation for 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.160
 help these people because there was no 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.110
 no one 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.150
 if we already know the neighborhoods more 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.870
 affected these carranza this radio of 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 auto carranza 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.459
 this was the worst moment 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.120
 I want to say the following about 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 cross very well said I say is parana 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 just as I say we add you 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.930
 you have to be very prudent to 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.660
 cross not diego exactly but in this 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.490
 case now when they made the decision to 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.120
 Cross 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.360
 Do it 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.519
 because much more serious is to stop in the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.909
 middle of the lagoons because there are cars 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.950
 behind a car caravan then 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.250
 when crossed bush cross if you do not 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 you do 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.820
 prudence indicates how it says they operate 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.330
 is that you do not have to do what there is not 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.960
 to cross and here look at a collective 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.590
 at the risk of this driver and 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.590
 amazed 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.240
 they can not deny whoever is with the mirror 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.240
 rearview 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.760
 until the images 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.490
 and then I'm surprised how it got animated 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.490
 to cross in those conditions 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.500
 and there you could see the first images of 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.870
 the life 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.080
 martÃ­nez 4 and 25 in the morning at the bottom of 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.080
 the league 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.760
 there was in future again
