 Water is the number one food, whether it's from the bottle or out of the bottle 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.310
 Lead comes 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.580
 ecologically there is a difference drinking water is 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.580
 more environmentally friendly than water from the bottle 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.300
 One liter of drinking water from the pipe needed for delivering up to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.559
 1000 times less energy than water from the bottle 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.090
 such an account is called Blancco balance on the creation of such

 Life Cycle Assessment is the Swiss ISU Services specializing in calculated there 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.949
 the effort for providing drinking water in mineral water 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.780
 Bottles from the domestic region and imported within a half 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.520
 Yearly mineral water which one buys in the shop closes only once packed

 that means he has to decorate worldcup-points 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.830
 and it is often transported relatively far up to 20 consumers 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.220
 comes with the little Lara still stored and so on 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.490
 and all of these processes and percent production steps we consume 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.440
 Energy ultimately causes the mineral water to fall 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.450
 the Nati after standing more consumes than tester drinking water 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.450
 the cock comes 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.830
 The energy expenditure can be a lot of talent with the Kombi Lanzen in the earthquake area 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.880
 to be converted 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 A liter of drinking water from the line no longer demands as a newcomer three 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 Military Academy Equivalent a favorable balance representative of his maxima 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 goes back because there is no packaging essential to that Pacult 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.670
 also the transport over pipelines must be before the association 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 as if the truck had 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.790
 and that's probably not a big distance 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.660
 much more value laid the valente must be calculated comes that 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.930
 Water from the bottle 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.140
 a big item is the energy required for the production of the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.410
 Criticism the bottle 94 millimeters 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.729
 Added to this is the consumption for the entire production process 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.450
 Flushing the bottle from 5 reviews and much more 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.509
 for that fall 13 millimeters of the Nikkei lost per liter 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.909
 then the bottles have to reach the consumers as well 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.799
 The supermarket is located at most 50 kilometers from the production site 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.400
 away, four come nine millimeters for transportation 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.379
 "All this effort is rehabilitated for a liter of mineral water from the 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 own region at 103 10 milliliters 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.689
 so if the water was out of the section he could still be so relatively out of the sea 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.039
 could this be the most important thing for the pet bottle pet bottles? 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:46.349
 and that's why it's so much of a part of one's life 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.189
 so important is Dr Transport 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.129
 Switzerland imports around one third of the consumed within Germany 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.749
 long transport routes devour a lot of energy 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.449
 at a transport of the dance of up to 1000 kilometers instead of the 4com 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:06.569
 on new milliliters of bottles from the local region 97 Military Academy 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.739
 equivalent consumed 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.789
 this beats strongly on the life cycle assessment 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:16.659
 imported from the EU to Switzerland that requires mineral water 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.899
 highest energy expenditure per liter 209 Mediator he fatally imposed the CFI 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.079
 It will also increase more and more lifestyle products so one does not 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.349
 that you have enough time in Nepal to get further away from violence hate 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.219
 it like that 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.779
 more exclusive is that Tesla gets more expensive it will not stay that way getting better 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.539
 bought more or settle could give qualitative reason for it 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.840
 This development criticizes the conservative Swiss 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.839
 National Councilor City of New York 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.059
 in environmental policy, fights for every gram of co2 and within 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.629
 Water could be relieved with the simplest means the environment 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.869
 Twitter makes beautiful blonde is a billion dollar market 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:02.969
 but also a market where only 7 or 8 percent of the bottles are returned 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.019
 that means that 220 million PC bottles will end up in nature or 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.629
 burned and that is what people have to pay for in the end 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.920
 Genscher if you rule a priority burns this co2 produced 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.430
 and to an effort our policy to avoid co2 production 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.470
 There must also be a limit to the PID thrown the bottles 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.029
 Percent in the basement 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:31.289
 In the Swiss parliament, therefore, Park brought me a request for mineral water 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.289
 Kata bottles of course wants to ban 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 in the first chamber, the conservative MP failed 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.289
 but he is first and foremost about a public discussion of what effort 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.629
 may operate a society for a simple product like water 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.120
 Precise gamekeepers make it impossible to take such an initiative 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 Getting through the first time is more about it 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.540
 first of all to draw attention to the problem mood you have to sail 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.840
 a discussion to trigger that piece by piece an awareness of 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.240
 This theme does not calm down where in Parliament but also in the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.229
 public opinion and when that happened we had better chances 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.539
 to get a positive vote a lot and sooner or later the price of oil again 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.660
 which means that the price of the bottles will continue to rise 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.050
 will the financial crisis and unemployment will force us 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.380
 anyway, no consumption to end the absolutely superfluous 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.210
 For consumers, a ban on minarets would be the Serengeti bottles 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.509
 make sense 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.629
 because tap water is priced at not even one cent per liter 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.520
 completely unrivaled and the price has already been quite a product 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.590
 enforced
