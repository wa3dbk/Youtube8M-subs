00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.200
 hello friends how are i am worth sailing 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 and this week I have a very project 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.939
 funny you will remember that does some 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.540
 weeks we converted some peak shoes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 in split ends this week I'm going to 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.880
 teach how to make a loom flower 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.130
 what is a very concrete touch for this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.130
 type of shoes or any other time 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.580
 for this project I transformed some 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.530
 shoes peak split ends 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.710
 cutting the sole was a little easier 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.330
 with hacksaw because it was very hard and the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.330
 rest if I carry it with a cutter 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.079
 since it has the desired shape it is time to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.079
 decorate 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.890
 for the flower we are going to use three 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.390
 circles one of five centimeters other 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.310
 of four and one more than two scissors 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 pins 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.829
 which in this case I'm going to use a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.010
 translucent that is a silk siphon and 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:20.690
 one more opaque 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.690
 glue or thread and needle 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 we must remember nine circles of five 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 centimeters one of four and one of two 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.280
 to cut the fabric will be easier 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 if we cut a strip and doubled it is in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.230
 several sections 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.840
 up to the top we are going to put the circle of 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.840
 paper holding it with pins 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.939
 and then we can cut several 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.939
 circles at a time 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.060
 we take a circle of 5 centimeters on 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.840
 what will be our base and about this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.269
 we will form the flower 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.720
 we put some glue on it 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.720
 center 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.480
 another circle we fold in half and 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.840
 new in half and we paste or sew 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.209
 in the center of the first 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.910
 we put the thick cloth 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.629
 glue before folding it so that it does not 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.629
 unfold 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.530
 so we fold and paste the first 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.400
 four circles in each quadrant of 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.400
 base circle 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.060
 the next four circles the 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.599
 we paste in outdated quadrants to the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.599
 first 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.180
 the four centimeter circle will be the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.150
 center of our flower we bend it to the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.150
 half we roll it over the center 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.990
 and we stick it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.349
 finally the smallest circle the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.840
 two centimeters we stick it in the part 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.410
 below to cover the glue or the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.410
 seams 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.469
 and so we have the flower 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.510
 I recommend you to know the flora of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.849
 shoe so we can change it 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.849
 easily and will be well subject 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.900
 you can experiment with different fabrics 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.720
 and colors to give it a very 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.940

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.580
