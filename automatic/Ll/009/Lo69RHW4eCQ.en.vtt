because I think that it's all the same I
think<00:01:27.600> there's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> machine<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
think there's a machine there's a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
think there's a machine there's a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to become a butterfly and then there's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
to become a butterfly and then there's
imagination<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.240> allows<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> human<00:01:34.020> being<00:01:34.259> to

experience reality and the idea is that
there<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> field<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.440> consciousness<00:02:13.040> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
there is a field of consciousness that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.820 
there is a field of consciousness that
we<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:14.090> like<00:02:14.420> water<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.170> fish<00:02:15.200> swimming

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830

we are in like water like fish swimming
in<00:02:15.980> water<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.489> field<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.970> consciousness<00:02:17.599> is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
in water the field of consciousness is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.290 
in water the field of consciousness is
like<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.989> thing<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.920> flowing<00:02:19.400> through<00:02:19.970> us

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
like a thing that is flowing through us

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.630 
like a thing that is flowing through us
and<00:02:20.540> we're<00:02:20.810> flavoring<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:21.980> our

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
and we're flavoring it with our

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.600 
and we're flavoring it with our
experiences<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.500> experiences<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.459> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
experiences so the experiences that you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.320 
experiences so the experiences that you
have<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> person<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.380> dropping<00:02:27.860> dye<00:02:28.850> in

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
have as a person is like dropping dye in

have as a person is like dropping dye in
the<00:02:29.480> water<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.080> there's<00:02:30.230> these<00:02:30.440> temporary

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
the water and there's these temporary

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.940 
the water and there's these temporary
colorings<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.840> field<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.290> consciousness

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
colorings of this field of consciousness

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.070 
colorings of this field of consciousness
and<00:02:34.069> that's<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.459> human<00:02:34.760> experience<00:02:35.269> if<00:02:35.630> you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
and that's the human experience if you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.220 
and that's the human experience if you
begin<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.590> watch<00:02:36.830> you'll<00:02:37.489> start<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.090> notice

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
begin to watch you'll start to notice

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.430 
begin to watch you'll start to notice
that<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.580> experience<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.910> broken<00:02:41.660> down<00:02:42.049> into

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
that your experience is broken down into

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
that your experience is broken down into
bits<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.099> they're<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.459> these<00:02:43.610> little<00:02:43.819> beads

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
bits and they're like these little beads

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.080 
bits and they're like these little beads
or<00:02:44.690> moments<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.410> experience<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.910> between

each of these beats or moments of

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.910 
each of these beats or moments of
experience<00:02:49.040> there's<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.299> pause<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.230> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
experience there's this pause and that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.759 
experience there's this pause and that
pause<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.569> field<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.049> pure<00:02:54.230> consciousness

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
pause is the field of pure consciousness

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.699 
pause is the field of pure consciousness
which<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.670> what<00:02:55.849> we<00:02:56.000> actually<00:02:56.209> are<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:57.230> person

Joe Rogan but that's not what you are
you're<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.660> consciousness<00:03:12.319> flowing

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
you're just consciousness flowing

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.670 
you're just consciousness flowing
through<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.310> like<00:03:13.489> water<00:03:13.880> through<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.390> sea<00:03:15.380> cave

the<00:03:16.220> idea<00:03:16.609> is<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.870> more<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.230> let<00:03:18.440> go<00:03:18.680> of

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
the idea is that the more you let go of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.860 
the idea is that the more you let go of
this<00:03:19.040> identity<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.910> self<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.540> more<00:03:20.750> you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
this identity of the self the more you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.440 
this identity of the self the more you
move<00:03:21.140> into<00:03:21.380> this<00:03:21.530> expansiveness<00:03:22.489> it's<00:03:23.180> this

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
move into this expansiveness it's this

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.190 
move into this expansiveness it's this
open<00:03:24.489> field<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.880> freedom<00:03:26.630> that's<00:03:26.930> very
