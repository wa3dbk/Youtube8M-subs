a<00:02:17.420> MacCabe<00:02:17.959> needs<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.130> defenses<00:02:19.820> up

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
a MacCabe needs to get some defenses up

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.850 
a MacCabe needs to get some defenses up
now<00:02:20.180> especially<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.320> Apollo<00:02:21.590> fire

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
now especially with the Apollo fire

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.920 
now especially with the Apollo fire
being<00:02:22.100> over<00:02:22.370> these<00:02:22.490> base<00:02:22.700> you'll<00:02:23.420> see<00:02:23.720> that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
being over these base you'll see that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.610 
being over these base you'll see that
they're<00:02:24.140> 0<00:02:24.380> unit<00:02:24.739> simply<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:27.260> hairs<00:02:27.470> of

coming<00:02:29.570> straight<00:02:30.020> down

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.070 

we'll<00:02:32.990> see<00:02:33.170> how<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.410> does<00:02:33.530> against<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:35.080> looks

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
we'll see how it does against that looks

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.840 
we'll see how it does against that looks
like<00:02:36.410> something's<00:02:36.950> been<00:02:37.130> built<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.670> mecca

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
like something's been built in the mecca
