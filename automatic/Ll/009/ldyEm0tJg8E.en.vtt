we've also reduced the linearity of the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.140 
we've also reduced the linearity of the
product<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.250> these<00:02:32.400> stars<00:02:32.790> you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
product so as you get these stars you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.180 
product so as you get these stars you
unlock<00:02:33.450> different<00:02:33.690> movies<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.010> go<00:02:35.130> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
unlock different movies so you can go to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.160 
unlock different movies so you can go to
different<00:02:35.370> levels<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.540> get<00:02:36.630> stuck<00:02:37.020> on

different levels so if you get stuck on

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.680 
different levels so if you get stuck on
one<00:02:37.230> level<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:38.459> fine<00:02:38.790> stop<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:39.480> try

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
one level that's fine stop go try

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
one level that's fine stop go try
something<00:02:39.959> else<00:02:40.200> come<00:02:40.739> back<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.190> try<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
something else come back and we try it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.720 
something else come back and we try it
again<00:02:41.580> later

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.300 

in<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.390> first<00:02:47.569> game<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.200> car<00:02:48.440> happening<00:02:48.950> was

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
in the first game the car happening was

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.449 
in the first game the car happening was
really<00:02:50.120> realistic<00:02:50.420> hi<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.739> guys<00:02:51.799> are<00:02:52.370> you

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
really realistic hi you guys are you

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.089 
really realistic hi you guys are you
going<00:02:52.670> for<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:52.909> same<00:02:53.090> approach<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:54.830> kind<00:02:55.040> of

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
going for the same approach we kind of

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.589 
going for the same approach we kind of
started<00:02:55.489> with<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.790> but<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:56.120> we<00:02:56.209> started<00:02:56.450> to

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
started with that but then we started to

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.470 
started with that but then we started to
pull<00:02:56.780> back<00:02:56.980> what<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.099> felt<00:02:58.310> was<00:02:58.459> more<00:02:58.909> of<00:02:59.239> a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
pull back what we felt was more of a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.170 
pull back what we felt was more of a
kind<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.409> gig<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:01.099> hold<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.640> play<00:03:01.879> kind

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
kind of gig like hold it and play kind

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.940 
kind of gig like hold it and play kind
of<00:03:02.239> mentality<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.500> pulled<00:03:03.739> back

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
of mentality so we kind of pulled back

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.460 
of mentality so we kind of pulled back
on<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.489> aspects<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.209> we<00:03:05.750> smooth<00:03:06.200> out

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
on some of the aspects and we smooth out

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.229 
on some of the aspects and we smooth out
some<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.280> jumps<00:03:07.730> made<00:03:07.940> them<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> little

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
some of the jumps made them a little

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.270 
some of the jumps made them a little
more<00:03:08.330> consistent<00:03:09.049> we're<00:03:09.650> really<00:03:09.799> working<00:03:10.069> on

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
more consistent we're really working on

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.100 
more consistent we're really working on
the<00:03:10.430> trip<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.940> engage<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.480> with<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> simple

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
the trip to engage it with a simple

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.740 
the trip to engage it with a simple
button<00:03:12.319> press<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.730> kind<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.239> feels

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
button press and just kind of it feels

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.300 
button press and just kind of it feels
natural<00:03:15.049> when<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.620> get<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.890> there<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.069> play

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
natural when you get in there and play

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.670 
natural when you get in there and play
it<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:16.909> that<00:03:17.209> was<00:03:17.360> pretty<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.959> was<00:03:18.530> an

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it so that was pretty that was an

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.050 
it so that was pretty that was an
important<00:03:19.069> factor<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.610> really<00:03:19.790> getting<00:03:20.000> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
important factor and really getting that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.509 
important factor and really getting that
pick-up-and-play<00:03:20.510> kind<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.019> feel<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:22.310> first

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
pick-up-and-play kind of feel the first

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.640 
pick-up-and-play kind of feel the first
game<00:03:22.819> had<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> very<00:03:23.540> entertaining<00:03:24.079> mission

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650

editor yo guys going to do a similar
approach<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:28.340> stun<00:03:28.640> constructor<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.480> going

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
approach the stun constructor is going

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.199 
approach the stun constructor is going
to<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.109> this<00:03:30.230> title<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.890> can't<00:03:31.879> really<00:03:32.060> talk

to be in this title I can't really talk

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.360 
to be in this title I can't really talk
much<00:03:32.269> about<00:03:32.599> that<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.079> yes<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.530> we're<00:03:33.769> making

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
much about that but yes and we're making

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.860 
much about that but yes and we're making
it<00:03:34.609> bigger<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.879> better<00:03:35.090> we're<00:03:35.480> adding<00:03:35.599> more

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
it bigger and better we're adding more

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.569 
it bigger and better we're adding more
elements<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.859> it's<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.430> be<00:03:37.549> a

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
elements to it and it's going to be a

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.140 
elements to it and it's going to be a
little<00:03:37.700> bit<00:03:37.910> stronger<00:03:38.200> another<00:03:39.200> very<00:03:39.500> popular

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
little bit stronger another very popular

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.599 
little bit stronger another very popular
mechanic<00:03:41.150> was<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.690> ability<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.230> cut<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.829> save
