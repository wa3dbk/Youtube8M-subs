00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 hi to all friends produces to the exar sound 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 and welcome a new tutorial today though 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.340
 I show the basic core agreements of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.720
 base that you can do with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 any midi keyboard 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.030
 piano whatever we say that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.479
 these are the first things you do 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.600
 they would teach if you went to school of 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:45.269
 plan ok maybe not really the first but 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.649
 we say we are there then like you all 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:54.600
 you know the piano is composed of the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.049
 solid scale doremifasol la sigo and then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 there are the notes that are to support the 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:07.020
 flat the sharp and so on 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.039
 ok and we're going to see now 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.829
 let's say the first scale that observing 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.710
 here where I am with the mouse or you will see 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.479
 what I do on the keyboard 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.479
 or this is a do 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:36.220
 and so on king makes me alone yes no 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.130
 ok the piano composed of these 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.130
 stairs or starting from the bottom 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.520
 coming again aldo for later 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.520
 start over from dr 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:02.780
 but you know where you go 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.600
 yes no and so on ok the scale is only 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.850
 by do re soles it yes no ok later though 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.800
 the agreements come or what they are 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.850
 the agreements the agreements means 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:28.300
 agree those notes that together forms 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:28.300
 they form a single or do do major 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 re minor 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.819
 re major e minor 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.709
 me major 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.750
 does 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.470
 is major 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.470
 sol 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.800
 G major 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 there 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.550
 the major 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.550
 and finally yes 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.090
 if you have cats under me they kill themselves 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.730
 if you saw what I did above 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.730
 my keyboard you will have more or less 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.880
 learn them by heart because they are 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.400
 the cat's dog and dog are important 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.530
 the dog also dies anyway 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.990
 guys from the agreements you can do 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.990
 there are too many things to remember 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.330
 that is the piano that goes badly 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.019
 because I have problems and unfortunately here 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.019
 I'm with the speakers 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.690
 and unfortunately no keyboard problem 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.280
 still very active, it is unique 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.670
 agreements we can really do anything 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.670
 boys 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.969
 oh well it's a little uncomfortable anyway 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.550
 you guys make agreements with 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.879
 all 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.990
 study well what is the scale e 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.219
 the agreements 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.659
 I leave for the moment because 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:08.029
 however, there is not much to say about 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.919
 those are the ones and that's all 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.960
 obviously there are more advanced than 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.529
 ie agreements we can make any 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:22.289
 this agreement is also short 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:24.300
 this is also an agreement to use this is 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.710
 an agreement but obviously two 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.710
 hands to make that deal ok 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.069
 later on we will see them for now 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:41.669
 this here and there climbing and you have to 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:44.219
 practice with this one well indeed 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.250
 today is all I greet you and see you at 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.250
 next
