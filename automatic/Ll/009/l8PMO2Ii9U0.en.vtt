00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
new school be zero carbon but in the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
new school be zero carbon but in the
meantime<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.629> make

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
meantime we're going to get on and make

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.630 
meantime we're going to get on and make
a<00:00:57.809> difference<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> we're<00:00:59.190> giving<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> half

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
a difference now and we're giving a half

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
a difference now and we're giving a half
a<00:00:59.789> million<00:00:59.940> pounds<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.020> think<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> couple<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a million pounds to I think a couple of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.599 
a million pounds to I think a couple of
hundred<00:01:02.010> schools<00:01:02.219> around<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> country

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
hundred schools around the country

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
hundred schools around the country
including<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.300> school<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.019> find<00:01:04.739> ways<00:01:04.920> which

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
including this school to find ways which

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.679 
including this school to find ways which
they<00:01:05.309> could<00:01:05.460> improve<00:01:05.549> their<00:01:06.210> buildings<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
they could improve their buildings to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.429 
they could improve their buildings to
make<00:01:06.780> them<00:01:06.900> better<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> environment

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
make them better for the environment

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.010 
make them better for the environment
it's<00:01:08.280> part<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.640> Jim<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> largest

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it's part as Jim said at the largest

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's part as Jim said at the largest
capital<00:01:10.380> investment<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.430> we've<00:01:11.580> ever<00:01:11.790> seen

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
capital investment which we've ever seen

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
capital investment which we've ever seen
in<00:01:12.270> our<00:01:12.390> schools<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
in our schools and I think the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.289 
in our schools and I think the
investment<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.700> important<00:01:15.150> part

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
investment is a really important part

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
investment is a really important part
transforming<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> life<00:01:16.110> chances<00:01:16.290> of
