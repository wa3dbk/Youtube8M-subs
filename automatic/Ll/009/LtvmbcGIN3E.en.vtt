00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.319 

butch<00:01:07.149> butch<00:01:08.979> which<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.100> a<00:01:10.159> bitch<00:01:10.369> what<00:01:11.180> are

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
butch butch which is a bitch what are

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:22.359 
butch butch which is a bitch what are
the<00:01:11.420> bitch<00:01:11.600> okay<00:01:20.439> what's<00:01:21.439> been<00:01:21.619> going<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:22.009> with

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
the bitch okay what's been going on with

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.380 
the bitch okay what's been going on with
butch<00:01:22.810> with<00:01:23.810> her<00:01:23.990> painting<00:01:24.470> attack<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.329> took

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
butch with her painting attack so I took

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.690 
butch with her painting attack so I took
a<00:01:26.509> look<00:01:26.630> at<00:01:26.750> our<00:01:26.780> ECG<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:28.310> looks<00:01:28.490> as<00:01:28.640> though

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
a look at our ECG and it looks as though

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.760 
a look at our ECG and it looks as though
butch<00:01:29.420> has<00:01:30.039> second-degree<00:01:31.039> AV<00:01:31.310> block<00:01:31.579> type<00:01:32.030> 2

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
butch has second-degree AV block type 2

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.889 
butch has second-degree AV block type 2
are<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.920> sure<00:01:34.220> because<00:01:34.670> i<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.060> type<00:01:35.299> 1<00:01:35.600> and

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
are you sure because i have type 1 and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.499 
are you sure because i have type 1 and
could<00:01:36.740> she<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:36.950> gone<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.310> for<00:01:37.460> me<00:01:37.579> well

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
could she have gone it for me well

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.600 
could she have gone it for me well
that's<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.289> really<00:01:39.590> excellent<00:01:39.890> thought<00:01:40.250> but

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
that's a really excellent thought but

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.600 
that's a really excellent thought but
it's<00:01:40.849> really<00:01:41.060> not<00:01:41.330> all<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.569> contagious<00:01:42.610> so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it's really not all that contagious so

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.330 
it's really not all that contagious so
it's<00:01:44.270> really<00:01:44.539> more<00:01:44.929> like<00:01:45.259> an<00:01:45.709> electrical

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's really more like an electrical

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.279 
it's really more like an electrical
problem<00:01:46.700> um<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.250> yeah<00:01:49.720> let's<00:01:50.720> take<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.899> look<00:01:51.170> at

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
problem um so yeah let's take a look at

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.480 
problem um so yeah let's take a look at
her<00:01:51.409> ECG<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:52.670> year<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:54.200> P<00:01:54.709> wave<00:01:54.860> which<00:01:55.310> is

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
her ECG this year is the P wave which is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.059 
her ECG this year is the P wave which is
caused<00:01:55.729> by<00:01:56.060> contraction<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.810> atria<00:01:57.289> which

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
caused by contraction of the atria which

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.319 
caused by contraction of the atria which
is<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.729> top<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.329> heart<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:01.729> here<00:02:02.179> is

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
is the top of the heart and this here is

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.639 
is the top of the heart and this here is
kind<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.700> okay<00:02:04.700> QRS<00:02:05.630> complex<00:02:06.259> which<00:02:06.500> is

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
kind of a okay QRS complex which is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.100 
kind of a okay QRS complex which is
caused<00:02:06.890> by<00:02:07.220> contraction<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.119> ventricles

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
caused by contraction of the ventricles

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.340 
caused by contraction of the ventricles
or<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.100> bottom<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.789> heart<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.390> what<00:02:12.230> we

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
or the bottom of the heart and what we

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.590 
or the bottom of the heart and what we
normally<00:02:12.680> want<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:13.220> see<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:15.430> p-wave

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
normally want to see is a p-wave

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.599 
normally want to see is a p-wave
followed<00:02:17.600> by<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> QRS<00:02:18.590> complex<00:02:19.190> because<00:02:19.340> that's

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
followed by a QRS complex because that's

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.970 
followed by a QRS complex because that's
telling<00:02:20.000> us<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.540> butch<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.500> heart<00:02:21.799> is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
telling us that butch is heart is

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.309 
telling us that butch is heart is
actually<00:02:22.370> getting<00:02:22.549> blood<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.959> rest<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
actually getting blood to the rest of

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.500 
actually getting blood to the rest of
her<00:02:24.410> body<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> problem<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.480> with

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
her body so the problem that we see with

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.229 
her body so the problem that we see with
butch<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.139> her<00:02:27.260> fainting<00:02:27.680> attacks<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.370> what

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
butch is her fainting attacks and what

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.809 
butch is her fainting attacks and what
that's<00:02:29.450> caused<00:02:29.810> by<00:02:30.079> and<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.489> all<00:02:31.670> these

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
that's caused by and we have all these

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.370 
that's caused by and we have all these
contractions<00:02:32.420> at<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.690> top<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.139> heart

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
contractions at the top of the heart

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.330 
contractions at the top of the heart
without<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.609> corresponding<00:02:36.250> contraction<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
without a corresponding contraction the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.849 
without a corresponding contraction the
bottom<00:02:37.639> of<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> heart<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.690> not<00:02:39.410> enough<00:02:39.620> blood

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
bottom of the heart so not enough blood

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.470 
bottom of the heart so not enough blood
getting<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> her<00:02:40.370> brain<00:02:40.459> or<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> rest<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.389> her

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
getting to her brain or the rest of her

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.300 
getting to her brain or the rest of her
body<00:02:41.799> um<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.880> calls<00:02:44.150> her<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.720> st.<00:02:45.290> all<00:02:46.100> right

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
body um so it calls her to st. all right

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.610 
body um so it calls her to st. all right
doc<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.819> have<00:02:47.150> an<00:02:47.329> x-ray<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:47.989> pocket<00:02:48.470> at<00:02:48.560> all

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
was talking about we have your instance

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.050 
was talking about we have your instance
there's<00:03:15.829> two<00:03:16.010> things<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.579> are<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:16.909> on

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.119 
there's two things that are going on
with<00:03:17.480> your<00:03:17.690> ECG<00:03:18.049> or<00:03:18.879> x-ray<00:03:19.879> if<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.510> will<00:03:21.129> you

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
with your ECG or x-ray if you will you

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.100 
with your ECG or x-ray if you will you
have<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:24.010> space<00:03:25.010> between<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:26.150> PA<00:03:26.390> which<00:03:26.930> we

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
have your space between the PA which we

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.860 
have your space between the PA which we
said<00:03:27.290> was<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.849> top<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.120> arc<00:03:29.209> attracting

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
said was the top of the arc attracting

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.890 
said was the top of the arc attracting
and<00:03:30.079> our<00:03:30.980> way<00:03:31.370> which<00:03:31.760> is<00:03:31.910> part<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.299> QRS

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
and our way which is part of the QRS

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.569 
and our way which is part of the QRS
which<00:03:33.349> we<00:03:33.560> said<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:34.069> ventricles

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
which we said is the ventricles

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.119 
which we said is the ventricles
contracting<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.629> we<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.620> space<00:03:36.890> is

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
contracting and we see this space is

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.319 
contracting and we see this space is
getting<00:03:37.430> longer<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.910> longer<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.910> over<00:03:40.910> here

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
getting longer and longer and over here

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.009 
getting longer and longer and over here
it<00:03:41.930> eventually<00:03:42.370> results<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:44.060> drop<00:03:44.690> in<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
it eventually results in a drop in the

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.059 
it eventually results in a drop in the
QRS<00:03:45.530> complex<00:03:46.450> diagnosis<00:03:47.450> won't<00:03:47.750> get<00:03:47.959> back<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
QRS complex diagnosis won't get back and

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.860 
QRS complex diagnosis won't get back and
that's<00:03:49.609> usually<00:03:49.879> not<00:03:50.090> going<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.420> cause<00:03:50.599> any

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
that's usually not going to cause any

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.710 
that's usually not going to cause any
trouble<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:52.609> actually<00:03:52.790> be<00:03:53.120> kind<00:03:53.629> of

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
trouble so this can actually be kind of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.750 
trouble so this can actually be kind of
a<00:03:53.810> normal<00:03:54.049> trace<00:03:54.470> if<00:03:54.769> we<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.129> somebody<00:03:55.549> like

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
a normal trace if we see somebody like

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.059 
a normal trace if we see somebody like
yourself<00:03:55.940> who<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:57.019> clearly<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.440> top<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.709> what<00:03:58.040> a

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
yourself who is clearly in top of what a

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.460 
yourself who is clearly in top of what a
condition<00:03:58.670> like<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:59.540> won't<00:03:59.780> will<00:04:00.049> be<00:04:00.200> seen

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
condition like a won't will be seen

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.250 
condition like a won't will be seen
right<00:04:00.769> exactly<00:04:01.569> well<00:04:02.569> what<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.019> do<00:04:03.230> about

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
right exactly well what can we do about

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.150 
right exactly well what can we do about
Butch's<00:04:03.859> condition<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:06.019> what<00:04:06.470> does<00:04:06.620> condition

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
Butch's condition so what does condition

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
Butch's condition so what does condition
is<00:04:07.310> actually<00:04:07.700> quite<00:04:07.880> severe<00:04:08.419> yeah<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:11.150> i

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
is actually quite severe yeah but so i

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.440 
is actually quite severe yeah but so i
would<00:04:11.690> say<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.410> our<00:04:13.040> best<00:04:13.819> option<00:04:14.329> it's

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
would say that our best option it's

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:32.740 
would say that our best option it's
installed<00:04:14.930> pacemaker<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:19.030> butch<00:04:20.030> look<00:04:31.750> don't

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
installed pacemaker I butch look don't

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.490 
installed pacemaker I butch look don't
