the Presto high speed handpiece you're

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.240 
the Presto high speed handpiece you're
going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> need<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> new<00:00:18.900> colic<00:00:19.500> if<00:00:19.710> your

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
going to need a new colic if your

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.859 
going to need a new colic if your
handpiece<00:00:20.670> won't<00:00:20.970> hold<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> burs

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
handpiece won't hold the burs

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.320 
handpiece won't hold the burs
if<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.590> turbine<00:00:22.980> seems<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.430> running<00:00:23.760> okay

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
if your turbine seems to be running okay

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.990 
if your turbine seems to be running okay
but<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> burs<00:00:25.170> come<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.340> after<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> lot

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
but the burs come out on you after a lot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630 
but the burs come out on you after a lot
of<00:00:27.029> use<00:00:27.560> then<00:00:28.560> you're<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> need<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> new

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
of use then you're going to need a new

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.089 
of use then you're going to need a new
caller<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> process<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.439> change<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> call

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
caller so the process to change the call

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
caller so the process to change the call
it<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.399> pretty<00:00:32.790> simple<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.510> long<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.930> follow

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it is pretty simple as long as we follow

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
it is pretty simple as long as we follow
the<00:00:34.290> steps<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.550> let's<00:00:35.730> take<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> through

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the steps so let's take you through

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.709 
the steps so let's take you through
those<00:00:36.360> steps<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:37.820> first<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
those steps now first thing I have is I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.740 
those steps now first thing I have is I
have<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:40.850> presto<00:00:41.850> handpiece<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
have my presto handpiece here and the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
have my presto handpiece here and the
dummy<00:00:43.110> burr<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.520> turbine<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.329> going

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
dummy burr is in the turbine I'm going

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
dummy burr is in the turbine I'm going
to<00:00:45.570> take<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.989> cartridge<00:00:46.469> wrench<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> I'm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to take my cartridge wrench and I'm

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.690 
to take my cartridge wrench and I'm
going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> loosen<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.140> counterclockwise<00:00:49.739> just

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
going to loosen it counterclockwise just

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
going to loosen it counterclockwise just
put<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> front<00:00:51.809> tabs<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
put it on the front tabs here on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
put it on the front tabs here on the
turbine<00:00:53.210> break<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.390> loose<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
turbine break it loose then I can

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
turbine break it loose then I can
continue<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> thread<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> off<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.550> my

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
continue to thread it off with my

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.849 
continue to thread it off with my
fingers<00:00:59.539> what<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> separates

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
fingers what that does is that separates

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
fingers what that does is that separates
the<00:01:02.309> turbine<00:01:02.640> cartridge<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> handpiece

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the turbine cartridge from the handpiece

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
the turbine cartridge from the handpiece
so<00:01:04.949> let's<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> handpiece<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.090> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so let's just get the handpiece out of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.250 
so let's just get the handpiece out of
the<00:01:06.270> way<00:01:06.390> here<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the way here we're just going to be

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
the way here we're just going to be
working<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> turbine<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.760> we're

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
working with the turbine because we're

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
working with the turbine because we're
gonna<00:01:09.119> replace<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.689> call<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.439> up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
gonna replace this call it that's up

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
gonna replace this call it that's up
inside<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> turbine<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> actual<00:01:12.240> part<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
inside the turbine the actual part that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
inside the turbine the actual part that
holds<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> burs<00:01:13.320> itself<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.090> going

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
holds the burs itself so what I'm going

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.609 
holds the burs itself so what I'm going
to<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> hold<00:01:19.229> this

to do now is I'm going to hold this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
to do now is I'm going to hold this
black<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.610> black<00:01:20.850> rotor<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> plastic

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
black the black rotor here the plastic

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
black the black rotor here the plastic
rotor<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.560> fingers<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
rotor with my fingers and I'm going to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.080 
rotor with my fingers and I'm going to
use<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.689> wrench<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> came<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.680> my

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
use the little wrench that came with my

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.210

nut<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.659> front<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> collet

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
nut here on the front of the collet

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
nut here on the front of the collet
there's<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.960> flats<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
there's little flats right here on the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.319 
there's little flats right here on the
very<00:01:38.100> front<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> collet<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:38.970> hoping<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
very front of the collet I'm hoping you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.819 
very front of the collet I'm hoping you
can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.810> good<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.380> you've<00:01:40.470> got<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> get

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
can see this good but you've got to get

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149 
can see this good but you've got to get
the<00:01:41.009> wrench<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.759> those<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.899> flats<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the wrench on those little flats and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
the wrench on those little flats and
it'll<00:01:44.460> break<00:01:44.700> loose<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> same<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it'll break loose just the same way that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.030 
it'll break loose just the same way that
the<00:01:46.259> turbine<00:01:47.189> did<00:01:47.430> from<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> handpiece<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the turbine did from the handpiece so we

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.910 
the turbine did from the handpiece so we
put<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> wrench<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.759> those<00:01:51.000> flats<00:01:51.740> twist<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
put the wrench on those flats twist it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.410 
put the wrench on those flats twist it
to<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> left<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.820> we're<00:01:53.970> doing<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.270> we're

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
to the left and all we're doing is we're

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.499 
to the left and all we're doing is we're
taking<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:54.990> nut<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.399> once<00:01:57.329> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
taking off a little nut here and once I

BER<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.540> turban<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.790> keeps

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
BER in the turban because then it keeps

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.699 
BER in the turban because then it keeps
all<00:02:16.299> my<00:02:16.450> parts<00:02:16.780> together<00:02:16.989> they<00:02:17.349> slide<00:02:17.680> right

all my parts together they slide right

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.149 
all my parts together they slide right
over<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.400> ber<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.950> nut

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
over the ber so here we have the nut

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.640 
over the ber so here we have the nut
coming<00:02:21.549> off<00:02:22.349> first

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
coming off first

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.229 
coming off first
that's<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.099> little<00:02:24.310> nut<00:02:24.519> here<00:02:24.909> that<00:02:25.120> we're

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
talking about it's very tiny and then we

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.390 
talking about it's very tiny and then we
got<00:02:28.359> an<00:02:28.450> even<00:02:28.659> smaller<00:02:29.019> part<00:02:29.890> called<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
that's a very important part so we have

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.849 
that's a very important part so we have
the<00:02:37.000> nut<00:02:37.209> here<00:02:37.629> and<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.109> have<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.379> guide<00:02:38.590> bush

seeing this good but you have the nut
the<00:02:42.879> guide<00:02:43.090> bush<00:02:43.389> and<00:02:43.659> before<00:02:44.170> your<00:02:44.409> call<00:02:44.620> it

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the guide bush and before your call it

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.339 
the guide bush and before your call it
comes<00:02:44.980> out<00:02:45.329> then<00:02:46.329> your<00:02:46.569> caller<00:02:46.810> will<00:02:47.019> come<00:02:47.170> out

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
comes out then your caller will come out

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.039 
comes out then your caller will come out
of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> tool<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.389> a<00:02:49.450> little<00:02:49.659> bit<00:02:49.810> hard

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
of the tool now it's a little bit hard

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.800 
of the tool now it's a little bit hard
now<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> can't<00:02:50.620> get<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.940> collet<00:02:52.359> out<00:02:52.510> of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
now I can't get the the collet out of

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.949 
now I can't get the the collet out of
the<00:02:52.900> tool<00:02:53.139> or<00:02:53.920> out<00:02:54.099> of<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.430> old<00:02:55.120> chuck<00:02:55.450> itself

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the tool or out of the old chuck itself

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.869 
the tool or out of the old chuck itself
because<00:02:56.439> this<00:02:56.590> Chuck's<00:02:57.010> not<00:02:57.220> worn<00:02:57.519> out<00:02:57.730> if

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
because this Chuck's not worn out if

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.490 
because this Chuck's not worn out if
you're<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.209> worn<00:02:58.389> out<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:59.200> bird<00:02:59.379> is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
you're just worn out the bird is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.929 
you're just worn out the bird is
probably<00:02:59.769> going<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> come<00:03:00.189> right<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.639> it

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
probably going to come right out of it

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.059 
probably going to come right out of it
but<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.720> one's<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.109> good<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.799> I'm<00:03:03.010> just

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
but this one's a good one so I'm just

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.789 
but this one's a good one so I'm just
going<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.340> push<00:03:03.549> it<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.909> bench<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:05.500> kind<00:03:05.709> of

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
going to push it on the bench to kind of

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.160 
going to push it on the bench to kind of
pop<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.069> out<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.549> there<00:03:09.930> actually<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> better

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
pop it out of there actually a better

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.869 
pop it out of there actually a better
way<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.439> do<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.889> I'm<00:03:12.099> just<00:03:12.250> gonna<00:03:12.400> thread<00:03:12.760> it

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
way to do it I'm just gonna thread it

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.379 
way to do it I'm just gonna thread it
back<00:03:12.909> in<00:03:13.389> the<00:03:13.540> hand<00:03:13.750> piece<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.879> push<00:03:16.180> the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
back in the hand piece here and push the

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.000 
back in the hand piece here and push the
Boro<00:03:16.569> out<00:03:16.780> again<00:03:17.230> yours<00:03:17.440> will<00:03:17.620> probably<00:03:17.889> come

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
Boro out again yours will probably come

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.580 
Boro out again yours will probably come
out<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.160> lot<00:03:18.400> easier<00:03:19.049> because<00:03:20.049> if<00:03:20.379> you're<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
out a lot easier because if you're a

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.080 
out a lot easier because if you're a
place<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.190> collet<00:03:21.579> your<00:03:21.699> call<00:03:21.879> it's<00:03:22.060> going

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
place in the collet your call it's going

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.039 
place in the collet your call it's going
to<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.359> worn<00:03:22.599> out<00:03:22.810> II<00:03:22.840> anyways<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:25.150> at<00:03:25.840> that

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
to be worn out II anyways so at that

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.890 
to be worn out II anyways so at that
point<00:03:26.349> we<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.829> pull<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
point we can just pull that out and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.349 
point we can just pull that out and
we've<00:03:29.139> got<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.440> get<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.739> old<00:03:30.069> Colin<00:03:31.000> out<00:03:31.180> of

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
we've got to get that old Colin out of

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.539 
we've got to get that old Colin out of
there<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.230> from<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.590> back<00:03:32.859> of<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.159> turbine<00:03:33.489> I

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
there so from the back of the turbine I

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.300 
there so from the back of the turbine I
just<00:03:33.730> turned<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.000> turbine<00:03:34.329> back<00:03:34.980> around<00:03:35.980> so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
just turned the turbine back around so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.729 
just turned the turbine back around so
we're<00:03:36.579> see<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:36.970> back<00:03:37.169> we've<00:03:38.169> got<00:03:38.199> our

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
we're see in the back we've got our

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.800 
we're see in the back we've got our
dummy<00:03:39.280> burn<00:03:39.579> just<00:03:39.849> push<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.299> through<00:03:40.419> the<00:03:40.569> back

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
dummy burn just push it through the back

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.580 
dummy burn just push it through the back
bearing<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.419> pops<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.629> collet<00:03:44.109> out<00:03:44.290> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
bearing and that pops the collet out the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
front so as you can see my college just

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.830 
front so as you can see my college just
came<00:03:47.709> out<00:03:47.949> of<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.370> front<00:03:48.609> of<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:48.790> turbine<00:03:49.180> so

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
came out of the front of the turbine so

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.710 
came out of the front of the turbine so
there's<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.229> column<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.650> I've<00:03:50.769> taken<00:03:50.979> out

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
the dummy BER at this point it's just a

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.290 
the dummy BER at this point it's just a
matter<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.830> holding<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.670> nut<00:04:31.910> with<00:04:32.120> my

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
back on to the turbine itself so I'm

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.260 
back on to the turbine itself so I'm
going<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.070> hold<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.430> nut<00:04:37.610> here<00:04:37.850> with<00:04:38.120> my

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270

soon<00:04:46.400> as<00:04:46.640> I<00:04:46.760> have<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.030> nut<00:04:47.330> snugged<00:04:48.200> up

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
soon as I have that nut snugged up

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.720 
soon as I have that nut snugged up
pretty<00:04:48.680> good<00:04:48.770> I'm<00:04:49.160> going<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.520> take<00:04:49.670> my

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
pretty good I'm going to just take my

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.280 
pretty good I'm going to just take my
wrench<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.270> just<00:04:50.390> snug<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.810> up<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.260> little

wrench and just snug it up just a little

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.580 
wrench and just snug it up just a little
bit<00:04:51.530> more<00:04:52.240> that's<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.420> process<00:04:53.720> right<00:04:54.110> there

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
bit more that's the process right there

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.190 
bit more that's the process right there
of<00:04:55.490> replacing<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.150> collet<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:56.750> now<00:04:56.870> our<00:04:56.900> new

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
of replacing the collet so now our new

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.520 
of replacing the collet so now our new
collet<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.890> in<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.820> turbine<00:04:59.210> cartridge<00:04:59.720> and

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
collet is in the turbine cartridge and

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.930 
collet is in the turbine cartridge and
now<00:05:00.740> all<00:05:00.920> we<00:05:00.950> got<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:01.250> do<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.460> put<00:05:01.760> the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
now all we got to do is put the

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.560 
now all we got to do is put the
cartridge<00:05:02.360> back<00:05:02.600> into<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:03.380> handpiece<00:05:04.010> I

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
cartridge back into the handpiece I

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.000 
cartridge back into the handpiece I
showed<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.750> in<00:05:05.930> another<00:05:06.170> video<00:05:06.470> but<00:05:06.830> what

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
showed this in another video but what

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.710 
showed this in another video but what
I'm<00:05:07.130> going<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.340> do<00:05:07.490> before<00:05:07.730> I<00:05:07.910> put<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.330> turbine

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
I'm going to do before I put the turbine

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.420 
I'm going to do before I put the turbine
back<00:05:08.930> into<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.530> handpiece<00:05:09.980> is<00:05:10.010> I'm<00:05:10.250> going<00:05:10.370> to
