00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
screen and below that here we have the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.880 
screen and below that here we have the
magic<00:02:00.479> trackpad<00:02:00.750> which<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.649> sometimes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
magic trackpad which I do use sometimes

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.709 
magic trackpad which I do use sometimes
and<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.549> use<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> computer<00:02:03.329> clan

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and I do use it in the computer clan

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.679 
and I do use it in the computer clan
live<00:02:03.930> studio<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.710> doing<00:02:04.979> our<00:02:05.070> live<00:02:05.219> streams

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
live studio for doing our live streams

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.419 
live studio for doing our live streams
and<00:02:06.689> next<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.039> external<00:02:08.399> hard

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and next to that I have an external hard

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.720 
and next to that I have an external hard
drive<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> firewire<00:02:09.899> 250<00:02:10.619> gigs<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.069> use<00:02:11.610> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
drive this is firewire 250 gigs I use it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.370 
drive this is firewire 250 gigs I use it
to<00:02:11.760> store<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> video<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:12.629> i<00:02:12.660> import

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to store a video when i import

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.160 
to store a video when i import
because<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.580> HD<00:02:14.970> format<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.480> i<00:02:15.510> use<00:02:15.840> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
because the HD format that i use is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.990 
because the HD format that i use is
really<00:02:16.770> high<00:02:16.920> quality<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.490> takes<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.820> lot

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
really high quality and takes up a lot

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.540 
really high quality and takes up a lot
of<00:02:18.030> space<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.690> since<00:02:19.470> firewires<00:02:19.920> faster<00:02:20.430> than

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
of space and since firewires faster than

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.970 
of space and since firewires faster than
USB<00:02:20.790> 2<00:02:21.120> i<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.560> Final<00:02:22.830> Cut<00:02:22.860> Pro

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
USB 2 i can use that in Final Cut Pro

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.340 
USB 2 i can use that in Final Cut Pro
and<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> lot<00:02:24.090> easier<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.600> edit<00:02:24.720> because<00:02:25.110> of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
and it's a lot easier to edit because of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.310 
and it's a lot easier to edit because of
its<00:02:25.710> speed<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:27.540> next<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.290> have

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
its speed and then next to that we have

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.040 
its speed and then next to that we have
the<00:02:28.470> other<00:02:28.620> creative<00:02:29.040> speaker<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:30.050> right

planning<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.440> selling<00:02:46.800> this<00:02:46.890> machine<00:02:47.280> soon

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
planning on selling this machine soon

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.670 
planning on selling this machine soon
and<00:02:47.730> getting<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.000> new<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:49.080> typically

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and getting a new one because typically

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.200 
and getting a new one because typically
Apple<00:02:50.040> refreshes<00:02:50.490> them<00:02:50.610> every<00:02:50.790> nine<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> ten

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
Apple refreshes them every nine to ten

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.700 
Apple refreshes them every nine to ten
months<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> predict<00:02:52.080> them<00:02:52.200> coming<00:02:52.500> up<00:02:52.590> in

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
months so I predict them coming up in

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.250 
months so I predict them coming up in
november<00:02:53.100> december<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.840> i<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.990> need<00:02:55.140> an

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
november december and i just need an

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.960 
november december and i just need an
overall<00:02:55.590> faster<00:02:56.010> machine<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> stuff<00:02:56.850> i

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
overall faster machine to do the stuff i

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.010 
overall faster machine to do the stuff i
need<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.270> these<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.660> thing<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.930> still

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
need to do these this thing is still

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.740 
need to do these this thing is still
dual-core<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.250> older<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.630> was

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
dual-core because it's older and it was

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.450 
dual-core because it's older and it was
a<00:03:00.900> lower<00:03:01.200> end<00:03:01.440> model<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:01.920> i<00:03:01.950> need<00:03:02.220> something

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
a lower end model so i need something

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.830 
a lower end model so i need something
faster<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.100> behind<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.580> we<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.600> some

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
faster and behind that here we have some

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.730 
faster and behind that here we have some
more<00:03:07.250> devices<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:09.990> they<00:03:10.350> are<00:03:10.380> two

control the g4 cube
so<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.850> basically<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.540> three<00:04:27.570> screens<00:04:28.170> here

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
so I basically have three screens here

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.520 
so I basically have three screens here
one<00:04:29.100> is<00:04:29.130> for<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.820> g4<00:04:30.390> which<00:04:30.690> does<00:04:31.020> run<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.320> few

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
one is for the g4 which does run a few

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.510 
one is for the g4 which does run a few
things<00:04:31.680> really<00:04:31.920> well<00:04:32.130> because<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.400> can

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
things really well because you can

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.860 
things really well because you can
connect<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> internet<00:04:33.090> they<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.750> run

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
connect to the internet they can run

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.710 
connect to the internet they can run
teamviewer<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.980> run<00:04:35.100> skype<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.390> it's<00:04:36.630> a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
teamviewer it can run skype so it's a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.540 
teamviewer it can run skype so it's a
good<00:04:36.900> machine<00:04:37.050> just<00:04:37.470> use<00:04:37.680> for<00:04:37.890> other<00:04:37.980> apps<00:04:38.250> and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
good machine just use for other apps and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.190 
good machine just use for other apps and
for<00:04:38.970> instance<00:04:39.090> if<00:04:39.360> you're<00:04:39.510> rendering<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.050> big

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
for instance if you're rendering a big

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.690 
for instance if you're rendering a big
video<00:04:40.380> or<00:04:40.650> something<00:04:40.770> on<00:04:41.040> your<00:04:41.160> main<00:04:41.280> system

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
video or something on your main system

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.860 
video or something on your main system
and<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.150> want<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.390> use<00:04:42.450> something

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
and you just want to use something

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.460 
and you just want to use something
that's<00:04:42.900> more<00:04:43.770> resource<00:04:44.220> free<00:04:44.840> because<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:46.320> I'm

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
that's more resource free because if I'm

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.840 
that's more resource free because if I'm
rendering<00:04:46.680> something<00:04:47.100> big<00:04:47.400> in<00:04:47.550> my<00:04:47.580> laptop

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
rendering something big in my laptop

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.730 
rendering something big in my laptop
I'll<00:04:48.330> have<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.600> another<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.500> another

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
I'll have it another of it another

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.350 
I'll have it another of it another
available<00:04:50.160> computer<00:04:50.550> just<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.940> use<00:04:51.150> because

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
available computer just to use because

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.920 
available computer just to use because
it<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.690> pretty<00:04:51.870> fast<00:04:52.170> even<00:04:52.710> though<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:52.980> all

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
it is pretty fast even though it's all

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.120 
it is pretty fast even though it's all
so<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.260> main<00:04:55.440> screen<00:04:55.830> for<00:04:56.100> that

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
so that's the main screen for that

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.000 
so that's the main screen for that
computer<00:04:56.490> obviously<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.180> then<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:58.010> the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
computer obviously and then I have the

built-in<00:04:59.220> screen<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> laptop<00:05:00.210> for<00:05:00.390> a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
built-in screen on the laptop for a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.080
