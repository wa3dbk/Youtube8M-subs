00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the Nexus phones we hope at least that's

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.360 
the Nexus phones we hope at least that's
what<00:03:07.600> we're<00:03:07.690> expecting<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.560> obviously<00:03:09.220> this

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
what we're expecting but obviously this

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.610 
what we're expecting but obviously this
is<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.580> 650<00:03:10.180> dollar<00:03:10.570> phone<00:03:10.960> compared<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
is a 650 dollar phone compared to the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.320 
is a 650 dollar phone compared to the
Nexus<00:03:11.890> support<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.250> cost<00:03:12.430> only<00:03:12.610> 300<00:03:13.090> bucks

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
Nexus support that cost only 300 bucks

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.000 
Nexus support that cost only 300 bucks
so<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.170> leads<00:03:14.290> me<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.620> question<00:03:14.710> of<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
so that leads me to the question of the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.920 
so that leads me to the question of the
day<00:03:15.070> are<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.940> disappointed<00:03:16.360> with<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> fact

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
day are you disappointed with the fact

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.600 
day are you disappointed with the fact
that<00:03:17.020> Google<00:03:17.290> Isle<00:03:17.620> didn't<00:03:18.100> bring<00:03:18.340> anything

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that Google Isle didn't bring anything

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.160 
that Google Isle didn't bring anything
that<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.940> were<00:03:19.090> actually<00:03:19.239> expecting<00:03:19.989> like<00:03:20.110> a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
that you were actually expecting like a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.320 
that you were actually expecting like a
new<00:03:20.350> version<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.739> Android<00:03:21.160> or<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.700> know<00:03:21.850> new

hardware<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:23.440> our<00:03:23.590> particular<00:03:23.739> case<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.489> do

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
hardware in our particular case we do

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.890 
hardware in our particular case we do
believe<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.209> there<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.450> sort<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.810> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
believe that there is sort of a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.720 
believe that there is sort of a
conspiracy<00:03:26.170> theory<00:03:26.770> here<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.220> do<00:03:27.430> believe

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
conspiracy theory here we do believe

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.370 
conspiracy theory here we do believe
that<00:03:27.880> Android<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:28.540> Google<00:03:28.570> are<00:03:28.930> waiting<00:03:29.350> for
