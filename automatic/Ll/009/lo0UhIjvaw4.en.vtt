it to be smooth and perfect and painted
and<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:24.840> stuff<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:26.250> was<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:26.699> a<00:03:26.790> really

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
and all that stuff I was in a really

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.319 
and all that stuff I was in a really
simple<00:03:27.750> rollover<00:03:28.530> accident<00:03:29.159> maybe<00:03:29.699> six<00:03:30.030> years

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
simple rollover accident maybe six years

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.659 
simple rollover accident maybe six years
ago<00:03:30.479> I<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.199> literally<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:31.799> like<00:03:32.009> 25<00:03:32.430> miles

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.179 
beforehand
so<00:04:02.019> there's<00:04:02.200> two<00:04:02.379> things<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.769> want<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:03.010> talk

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
so there's two things I want to talk

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.360 
so there's two things I want to talk
about<00:04:03.400> their<00:04:03.930> one<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.349> find<00:04:05.709> mechanics

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
about their one is to find mechanics

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.149 
about their one is to find mechanics
that<00:04:06.459> can<00:04:06.879> come<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.629> these<00:04:08.349> are<00:04:08.530> mechanics

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
that can come to you these are mechanics

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.309 
that can come to you these are mechanics
who<00:04:09.459> are<00:04:09.819> basically<00:04:10.299> moonlighting<00:04:11.019> most<00:04:11.200> of

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
who are basically moonlighting most of

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.929 
who are basically moonlighting most of
the<00:04:11.379> time<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.069> that<00:04:12.220> means<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.579> don't<00:04:12.700> have

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
the time so that means they don't have

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.580 
the time so that means they don't have
to<00:04:13.090> pay<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.420> government<00:04:13.540> taxes<00:04:14.319> they<00:04:14.439> don't

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
to pay the government taxes they don't

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.080 
to pay the government taxes they don't
have<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.799> pay<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.099> government<00:04:15.220> permits<00:04:15.939> and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
have to pay the government permits and

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.729 
have to pay the government permits and
they<00:04:16.359> don't<00:04:16.510> have<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.870> pay<00:04:17.079> for<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.440> space

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
they don't have to pay for the space

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.039 
they don't have to pay for the space
that<00:04:17.979> big<00:04:18.220> garage<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.940> pull<00:04:19.180> into<00:04:19.389> now

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
that big garage that you pull into now

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.569 
that big garage that you pull into now
whether<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.410> agree<00:04:20.769> with<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.039> first<00:04:21.250> or<00:04:21.549> the

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
whether you agree with the first or the

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.950 
whether you agree with the first or the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
second thing that these people are not

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.900 
second thing that these people are not
paying<00:04:23.229> for<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.620> besides<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.190> point<00:04:24.310> it's

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
paying for is besides the point it's

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.490 
paying for is besides the point it's
going<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.240> save<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:25.720> money<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.139> the<00:04:26.199> long<00:04:26.289> run

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
going to save you money in the long run

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.640 
going to save you money in the long run
because<00:04:27.100> their<00:04:27.520> costs<00:04:28.090> are<00:04:28.210> your<00:04:28.630> costs<00:04:29.139> so

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
because their costs are your costs so

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.409 
because their costs are your costs so
when<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.889> pull<00:04:30.130> into<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.460> garage<00:04:30.729> you're

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
when you pull into that garage you're

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.210 
when you pull into that garage you're
paying<00:04:31.750> them<00:04:32.080> for<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.560> cost<00:04:32.889> of<00:04:33.070> their

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
paying them for that cost of their

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.100 
paying them for that cost of their
garage<00:04:33.520> rental<00:04:34.030> if<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.510> can<00:04:34.630> get<00:04:34.750> someone<00:04:35.050> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
garage rental if you can get someone to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.659 
garage rental if you can get someone to
come<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:35.770> fix<00:04:36.010> your<00:04:36.070> vehicle<00:04:36.520> that's

going to save you an arm and a leg the
other<00:04:39.100> thing<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.340> want<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.610> say<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.060> if<00:04:40.360> you

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
other thing I want to say is that if you

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
can do the repairs yourself go for it

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.969 
can do the repairs yourself go for it

one time you're going to remember it
from<00:04:48.580> there<00:04:48.850> on<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.530> did<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> door

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
from there on in so I did the door

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.310 
from there on in so I did the door
myself<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.820> had<00:04:51.970> no<00:04:52.270> clue<00:04:52.539> how<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.870> do<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.199> before

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
myself I had no clue how to do it before
