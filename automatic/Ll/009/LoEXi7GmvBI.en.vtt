things the gas line was broken on it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.850 
things the gas line was broken on it
rotted<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.719> also<00:00:39.719> needed<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> gas<00:00:40.320> tank<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
rotted out also needed a gas tank for

rotted out also needed a gas tank for
that<00:00:40.890> matter<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.360> couple

bucks we spent at Walmart problem solved
the<00:00:46.739> trailers<00:00:47.160> hurting<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the trailers hurting a little bit the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
the trailers hurting a little bit the
tires<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.750> dry<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> little

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
tires are kind of dry right a little

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
tires are kind of dry right a little
rusty<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> trailer<00:00:50.850> hitch<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> missing<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
rusty and the trailer hitch is missing a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
rusty and the trailer hitch is missing a
few<00:00:51.719> parts<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.829> aside<00:00:53.039> from<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:54.090> thing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
few parts but aside from that this thing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
few parts but aside from that this thing
floats<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.260> catches<00:00:55.440> bass<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.550> all

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
floats and it catches bass so that's all

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.800 
floats and it catches bass so that's all
that's<00:00:56.850> important

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.840 

one<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:02.800> first<00:01:03.040> things<00:01:03.310> that<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.520> wanted<00:01:03.760> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
one of the first things that I wanted to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.000 
one of the first things that I wanted to
build<00:01:04.000> for<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:04.360> boat<00:01:04.540> was<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> deck<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.710> put<00:01:05.920> in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
build for the boat was a deck to put in

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.830 
build for the boat was a deck to put in
the<00:01:06.100> bow<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:07.150> we<00:01:07.240> could<00:01:07.360> have<00:01:07.510> something<00:01:07.780> to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
the bow so we could have something to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.140 
the bow so we could have something to
stand<00:01:08.080> on<00:01:08.350> place<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.770> chair<00:01:09.160> like<00:01:09.730> most<00:01:09.940> bass

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
stand on place a chair like most bass

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.290 
stand on place a chair like most bass
boats<00:01:10.450> have<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:11.530> did<00:01:11.770> this<00:01:11.979> by<00:01:12.580> taping

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
boats have we did this by taping

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.719 
boats have we did this by taping
together<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.750> bunch<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.110> pieces<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.410> newspaper

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
together a bunch of pieces of newspaper

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.010 
together a bunch of pieces of newspaper
holding<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.820> flat<00:01:16.120> over<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.450> surface<00:01:16.870> where

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
holding it flat over the surface where

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.450 
holding it flat over the surface where
we<00:01:17.050> wanted<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.740> deck<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.130> actually

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
we wanted to have the deck and actually

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.880 
we wanted to have the deck and actually
just<00:01:18.640> tracing<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.479> outline<00:01:19.869> of<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.380> boat<00:01:20.590> so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
just tracing the outline of the boat so

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.010 
just tracing the outline of the boat so
we<00:01:20.920> could<00:01:21.100> have<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> template<00:01:21.790> we<00:01:22.630> went<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:22.960> got

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
we could have a template we went and got

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.950 
we could have a template we went and got
a<00:01:23.110> large<00:01:23.440> piece<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.800> marine<00:01:24.400> plywood<00:01:25.000> sent

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
a large piece of marine plywood sent

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.540 
a large piece of marine plywood sent
down<00:01:26.170> over<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.060> cut<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.360> shape<00:01:29.550> there

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
down over it and cut out the shape there

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.130 
down over it and cut out the shape there
wasn't<00:01:30.880> any<00:01:31.030> real<00:01:31.240> engineering<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:31.900> went

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
wasn't any real engineering that went

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.880 
wasn't any real engineering that went
into<00:01:32.320> this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
into this

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.280 
into this
so<00:01:33.490> we<00:01:34.060> had<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.390> little<00:01:34.570> extra<00:01:34.780> sanding

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
so we had to do little extra sanding

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.080 
so we had to do little extra sanding
little<00:01:35.680> extra<00:01:35.920> cutting<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.729> make<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:36.910> all

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
little extra cutting just to make it all

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.109 
little extra cutting just to make it all
fit<00:01:37.740> keep<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.890> mind<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.399> also<00:01:39.550> designed

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
fit keep in mind that we also designed

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.700 
fit keep in mind that we also designed
this<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.479> that<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.990> take<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.440> out<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.680> we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this so that we can take it out if we

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.380 
this so that we can take it out if we
have<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.040> clean<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.399> boat<00:01:42.610> or<00:01:42.910> pressure

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
have to clean the boat or pressure

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.790 
have to clean the boat or pressure
washing<00:01:43.660> something<00:01:43.990> like<00:01:44.170> that<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.619> pops

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
washing something like that so it pops

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.010 
washing something like that so it pops
out<00:01:45.100> we<00:01:45.759> needed<00:01:46.000> some<00:01:46.119> extra<00:01:46.360> support<00:01:46.899> in

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
out we needed some extra support in

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.499 
out we needed some extra support in
between<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.979> two<00:01:48.430> seats<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:49.000> we<00:01:49.060> gained<00:01:49.330> that

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
between the two seats and we gained that

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.450 
between the two seats and we gained that
by<00:01:50.140> actually<00:01:50.500> taking<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> couple<00:01:51.399> of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
by actually taking just a couple of

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.219 
by actually taking just a couple of
pieces<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.759> wood<00:01:52.000> drilling<00:01:52.450> some<00:01:52.600> holes<00:01:52.660> and

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
pieces of wood drilling some holes and

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.440 
pieces of wood drilling some holes and
taking<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.130> few<00:01:54.280> screws<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.880> constructing

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
taking a few screws and constructing

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.670 
taking a few screws and constructing
something<00:01:55.660> that<00:01:55.930> kind<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.200> looked<00:01:56.350> like<00:01:56.380> this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
something that kind of looked like this

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.310 
something that kind of looked like this
we<00:01:57.550> reinforced<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.539> also<00:01:58.750> put<00:01:58.930> some<00:01:58.960> foam

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
we reinforced it and also put some foam

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.779 
we reinforced it and also put some foam
padding<00:01:59.740> on<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.920> bottom<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.520> wouldn't

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
padding on the bottom so it wouldn't

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.820 
padding on the bottom so it wouldn't
damage<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.149> aluminum<00:02:01.780> underneath<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:02.649> when

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
damage the aluminum underneath that when

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.090 
damage the aluminum underneath that when
we<00:02:02.979> put<00:02:03.190> weight<00:02:03.369> on<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:04.680> after<00:02:05.680> we<00:02:05.770> built<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
we put weight on it after we built the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.070 
we put weight on it after we built the
bracing<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.880> attached<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.869> first

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
bracing we attached it to that first

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.590 
bracing we attached it to that first
piece<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.380> ply<00:02:08.649> wouldn't<00:02:09.040> look<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
piece of ply wouldn't look like this the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.240 
piece of ply wouldn't look like this the
next<00:02:10.810> step<00:02:10.929> was<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.410> put<00:02:11.440> some<00:02:11.769> carpet<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
next step was to put some carpet on the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.310 
next step was to put some carpet on the
platform<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.269> went<00:02:13.420> out<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> Home<00:02:13.840> Depot<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.039 
carpet
it's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.190> UV<00:02:18.580> resistant<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.299> it's<00:02:19.480> also<00:02:19.660> good

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
it's a UV resistant and it's also good

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.509 
it's a UV resistant and it's also good
with<00:02:20.230> getting<00:02:20.410> wet<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.769> it'll<00:02:21.310> be<00:02:21.370> pretty

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
with getting wet so it'll be pretty

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.610 
with getting wet so it'll be pretty
tough<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:22.000> we're<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.209> on<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.390> water<00:02:22.660> we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
tough when we're out on the water we

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
spots just to make sure everything was

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.040 
spots just to make sure everything was
perfectly<00:03:27.860> sealed<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.910> has<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.330> rest<00:03:29.540> for<00:03:29.750> 24

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
perfectly sealed this has to rest for 24

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.380 
perfectly sealed this has to rest for 24
hours<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.370> can't<00:03:31.580> really<00:03:31.820> test<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.210> motor

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
hours so we can't really test the motor

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.390 
hours so we can't really test the motor
out<00:03:32.630> until<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:32.960> dries<00:03:33.170> out<00:03:33.440> I've<00:03:34.010> got<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> couple

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
out until it dries out I've got a couple

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.620 
out until it dries out I've got a couple
other<00:03:34.610> things<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.880> need<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> take<00:03:35.210> care<00:03:35.480> of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
other things we need to take care of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.530 
other things we need to take care of
though<00:03:36.430> remember<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.550> trailer<00:03:37.940> hitch<00:03:38.120> it

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
though remember that trailer hitch it

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.690 
though remember that trailer hitch it
was<00:03:38.750> missing<00:03:39.110> everything<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.310> we<00:03:40.430> took<00:03:40.580> a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
was missing everything so we took a

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.520 
was missing everything so we took a
dremel<00:03:41.060> tool<00:03:41.210> and<00:03:41.420> actually<00:03:41.540> modified<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
dremel tool and actually modified it a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.320 
dremel tool and actually modified it a
little<00:03:42.560> bit<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.130> make<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.310> fit<00:03:43.460> these<00:03:43.880> new<00:03:44.090> kind

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
little bit to make it fit these new kind

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.520 
little bit to make it fit these new kind
of<00:03:44.450> trailer<00:03:44.780> hitches<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.410> today<00:03:47.530> we

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
of trailer hitches that you see today we

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.440 
of trailer hitches that you see today we
also<00:03:48.710> installed<00:03:49.490> the<00:03:49.610> chair<00:03:49.880> onto<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
also installed the chair onto the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.420 
also installed the chair onto the
platform<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.470> final<00:03:51.800> result<00:03:52.100> for<00:03:52.160> it

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
platform and the final result for it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.820 
platform and the final result for it
looks<00:03:52.760> like<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:57.230> next<00:03:57.500> thing<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.650> we

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
looks like this the next thing that we

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.220 
looks like this the next thing that we
wanted<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.190> do<00:03:58.340> was<00:03:58.520> clean<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.970> thing<00:03:59.030> out<00:03:59.450> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
wanted to do was clean this thing out it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.500 
wanted to do was clean this thing out it
had<00:04:00.470> years<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.040> neglect<00:04:01.400> grown<00:04:01.820> on<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.180> bottom

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
had years of neglect grown on the bottom

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.420 
had years of neglect grown on the bottom
of<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:02.810> was<00:04:02.900> pretty<00:04:03.140> nasty<00:04:03.320> so<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.250> took<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
of it it was pretty nasty so we took a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.160 
of it it was pretty nasty so we took a
pressure<00:04:04.760> washer<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.630> can<00:04:05.780> actually

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
pressure washer to and you can actually

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.130 
pressure washer to and you can actually
see<00:04:06.470> all<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.800> dirts<00:04:07.160> being<00:04:07.520> blasted<00:04:07.850> off<00:04:08.240> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
see all the dirts being blasted off the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.840 
see all the dirts being blasted off the
water<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.560> was<00:04:09.710> draining<00:04:09.980> out<00:04:10.190> was<00:04:10.340> pretty

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
water that was draining out was pretty

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.680 
water that was draining out was pretty
nasty<00:04:11.090> but<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:13.280> cleaned<00:04:13.640> up<00:04:13.820> fairly<00:04:14.360> well<00:04:14.480> for

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
nasty but it cleaned up fairly well for

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.710 
nasty but it cleaned up fairly well for
what<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.930> was<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:16.250> inside<00:04:16.670> still<00:04:17.510> has<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
what it was the inside still has a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.270 
what it was the inside still has a
little<00:04:17.930> extra<00:04:18.140> stuff<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.620> we<00:04:18.859> can't<00:04:19.100> take

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
little extra stuff that we can't take

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.640 
little extra stuff that we can't take
off<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:20.600> really<00:04:20.870> shined<00:04:21.170> when<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.470> start

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
off it really shined when you start

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.170 
off it really shined when you start
taking<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:21.920> polish<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:23.000> before

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
taking the polish to it this is before

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.260 
taking the polish to it this is before
the<00:04:23.570> Polish<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:25.160> this<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:25.490> after<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.940> Polish

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
the Polish and this is after the Polish

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.180 
the Polish and this is after the Polish
the<00:04:26.540> entire<00:04:27.200> side<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.650> boat<00:04:27.890> looks

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
the entire side of the boat looks

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.940 
the entire side of the boat looks
something<00:04:28.400> like<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:32.500> cleaning<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:33.710> thing

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
something like this cleaning this thing

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.280 
something like this cleaning this thing
off<00:04:34.130> took<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.490> lot<00:04:34.730> of<00:04:34.760> time<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.510> don't<00:04:36.140> think

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
off took a lot of time I don't think

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.840 
off took a lot of time I don't think
it's<00:04:36.500> ever<00:04:36.740> been<00:04:36.980> polished<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:37.580> when<00:04:37.730> we

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
it's ever been polished so when we

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's ever been polished so when we
started<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.270> wax<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.900> actually<00:04:39.230> took<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.470> lot

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
started to wax it it actually took a lot

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.760 
started to wax it it actually took a lot
of<00:04:39.860> arm<00:04:40.010> work<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.460> get<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.730> shiny<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:42.410> also<00:04:42.560> had

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
of arm work to get it shiny we also had

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.200 
of arm work to get it shiny we also had
to<00:04:42.860> do<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.980> lot<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.220> research<00:04:43.490> on<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.000> motor

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
to do a lot of research on the motor

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.360 
to do a lot of research on the motor
itself<00:04:44.570> because<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.290> vintage<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.010> lot<00:04:46.220> of

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
itself because it is vintage so a lot of

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.920 
itself because it is vintage so a lot of
marine<00:04:46.670> stores<00:04:47.030> around<00:04:47.210> here<00:04:47.420> didn't<00:04:47.780> really

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
marine stores around here didn't really

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.450 
marine stores around here didn't really
have<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.110> whole<00:04:48.290> lot<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.440> information<00:04:49.040> for<00:04:49.280> us

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
have a whole lot of information for us

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.760 
have a whole lot of information for us
but<00:04:50.360> stay<00:04:50.570> tuned<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.229> we're<00:04:51.410> going<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.590> show

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
but stay tuned and we're going to show

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.020 
but stay tuned and we're going to show
you<00:04:51.830> some<00:04:52.100> more<00:04:52.130> about<00:04:52.490> how<00:04:52.640> we<00:04:52.700> get<00:04:52.910> this

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
you some more about how we get this

you some more about how we get this
