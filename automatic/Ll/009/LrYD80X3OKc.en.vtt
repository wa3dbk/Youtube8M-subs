00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.349
 to make this piece a little bit good 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.510

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.360

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:27.720
 teacher, they only look for so many 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:27.720
 papers that I would like our 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.050
 students 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.810
 I will accommodate the pieces yes because 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.750
 It's super super simple to perform 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.600
 we have these 100 appointments and that with the 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.900
 I do not know if I can call for now 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.199
 they already have reason to climb a little 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.949
 so they can see that way 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.320
 we always have the part of you 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.750
 come here comes the little face 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.409
 apparently they are two in a few more 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.110
 as we know all around 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.969
 leaves the vegetable by the neck but not 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.849
 are going to leave for the hat for the 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.789
 we have those who visit us 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.309
 here it is clear we are going to cut 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.580
 leaving the way you also visit 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:21.999
 vegetable inside to pass what is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.529
 the belt with a strip of we can 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.039
 do it from any shit that we 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.039
 like 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.080
 and we have here 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.430
 the little arm these three green pieces that 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.160
 you see here if I'm just going to place 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.250
 I'm going to move it a little bit, let's play 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.790
 these three green pieces are going to form the 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.370
 cap what we're going to make the cap myself 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.400
 I'll tell you how they're going to be more step by step 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.130
 the hat and then the completion of 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.650
 clear egg I'm just teaching going to 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.570
 be this way but I 'm going to 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.220
 explain how 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.960
 this piece above I'm also going to 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.880
 show I'm going to take off is super 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.280
 simple all that the guide brings the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.550
 step by step how is the process for 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.490
 cut important is already I'm going to 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.520
 remove because I need them to see 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.010
 what is the baba time that they have to 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.920
 look for in any florist in 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.460
 any store that you see that 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.100
 they sell glass or bowl they have to have a 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.160
 cover in this way although with this 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.040
 What is important 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.750
 that's super important because you know 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:44.830
 who do not know 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:47.350
 well then I will set aside 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.390
 notice that all this is simple these 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.689
 are the pieces we have another piece that is 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.059
 the circle that will be erasing 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.909
 in the part of the lid part well 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:07:01.089
 that we will be working little by little 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:04.269
 and this piece that takes the hat towards 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:06.699
 above, this is the same as the polar command 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:09.819
 what we do and we do clear curves this 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:12.429
 pattern is in the guides and you what 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.110
 What they do is cut with their scissors and 

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:16.589
 they get to know it with the coasts 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.739
 hands around the contour or gives a 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:24.819
 little dot of a triple to be 

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:28.739
 adhere to this one from which you 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.739
 come here the felt hat 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:38.079
 this plan to arrive is fine because but 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:40.869
 all of that because let him have to 

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:42.309
 be a little bit hard there is a certain 

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:44.139
 It is very watery that you are going to buy 

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:45.699
 the durito think it 's super super 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.949
 spectacular 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.330
 up here in my pretty teacher we are going to 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:53.669
 make a small cut this look 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.689
 a little kiss like this on the bed we make a 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.689
 small cut already returns
