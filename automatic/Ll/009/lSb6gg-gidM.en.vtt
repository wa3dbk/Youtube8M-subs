00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and we're just we're just kind of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
and we're just we're just kind of
getting<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> know<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.689> getting

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
getting this is you know just getting

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
getting this is you know just getting
started<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.579> give<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.880> more

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
started so you know give a little more

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.910 
started so you know give a little more
time<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:03.840> it'll<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.320> spread

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
time and I think it'll kind of spread

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
time and I think it'll kind of spread
slowly<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.610> surely<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:06.540> nice<00:02:06.689> wine<00:02:06.869> is
