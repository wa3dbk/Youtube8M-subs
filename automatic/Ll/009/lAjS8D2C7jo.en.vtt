00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 very good gentlemen now stayed health 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 educational and today we are going to talk 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.000
 about a couple of things but let's talk 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.670
 well I will leave the best for last 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.309
 let's start first with xbox one what happens 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.320
 with the people of xbox one remember that it is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.529
 110 back the microsoft people confirmed 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 that they were going to do a test selling 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.180
 digital games at very low prices 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 well it seems that this test is going to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 start tomorrow and one of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 games that have been greatly reduced will 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.820
 be the rise are backgrounds the rice children of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 Roman to put the rais as the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 Rising also good as me 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 I'm going to repeat it micro are to start 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 the test tomorrow to see if people buy 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.649
 digital games at very low prices and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 they're going to start with the crytek game 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.329
 race so you know already from the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.420
 tomorrow Tuesday, February 18 until the day 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.030
 February 24th that is Monday if I do not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070
 mistaken 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.290
 so these games are going to be cheap 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.980
 but it costs 40 dollars and it's going to be 40 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.560
 dollars the digital version of rise 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.330
 unlike the physical version that you 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.800
 it's worth 60 with all taxes put 64 in 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.210
 physics and also the same in digital 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.010
 you will also pay taxes so 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.840
 put him up to 40 by the 44 43 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.110
 depending on where you live not 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.250
 but so you already know and obviously 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.200
 they are going to put more games and so on 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.870
 do the test but you know if you want 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.870
 share the game wait until tomorrow 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 so now we go with the following and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.540
 the following this is about the walking 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 dead the walking dead season 2 the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.980
 episode 2 we all know that in this month 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.010

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.470
 taltal game people already put a small 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.900
 teaser or a screenshot not of this new 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.390
 episode that should come out in this month 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.210
 there is no exact date yet but as you see in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 the image can move clementine with 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.170
 a hammer trying to kill a zombie and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.480
 the one behind is one of the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.210
 survivors of episode 1 so no 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 no spoiler did not say anything so now 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.440
 you know this is what has been shown 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.950
 so far from season two 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.610
 episodes of walking dead ' 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 so you already know it most likely 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.430
 is that this good tlc that the episode 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.650
 come out next Tuesday since the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.320
 developer and head of 30 who said 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 that the walking dead episodes is at 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.370
 around the corner most likely that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 come out suddenly this Tuesday or in the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.360
 worst case you go out and make ends meet 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 February since they always give a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.650
 episode for every month not but good 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 just wait and see what happens 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.550
 so you already know the huge me 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.920
 dismissal fills the favorite's comments 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.540
