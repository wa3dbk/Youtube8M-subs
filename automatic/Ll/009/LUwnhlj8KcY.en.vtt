for<00:00:04.830> void<00:00:05.069> keys<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.549> warframe<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.509> you

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
for void keys in warframe so if you

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.030 
for void keys in warframe so if you
don't<00:00:06.750> know<00:00:06.839> what<00:00:06.990> tower<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.410> void<00:00:07.620> keys<00:00:07.859> are

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
don't know what tower for void keys are

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.009 
don't know what tower for void keys are
they<00:00:08.519> are<00:00:08.670> an<00:00:08.760> even<00:00:09.059> higher<00:00:09.269> tier<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> void

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
they are an even higher tier of the void

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
they are an even higher tier of the void
that<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.260> can<00:00:10.380> access<00:00:10.830> by<00:00:11.010> using<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:11.550> keys

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.759 
missions across the solar system do note
these<00:00:27.420> interception<00:00:28.019> missions<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> be

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
these interception missions have to be

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.009

above the level of enemy level of 10 or

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.659 
above the level of enemy level of 10 or
you<00:00:31.470> will<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.980> able<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> key<00:00:32.640> from

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
third round that third round reward can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.389 
third round that third round reward can
be<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.780> tower<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.530> void<00:00:55.829> key<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> any

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
be a tower for void key and any

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
be a tower for void key and any
subsequent<00:00:56.850> rounds<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> complete<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.079> also

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
subsequent rounds you complete it also

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
subsequent rounds you complete it also
has<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> chance<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> tower<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.879> void<00:01:00.149> key

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
has a chance to be a tower for void key

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
has a chance to be a tower for void key
so<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> round<00:01:01.890> 3

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so you're gonna have to get to round 3

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
so you're gonna have to get to round 3
and<00:01:02.460> keep<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.120> fighting<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.229> things

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and keep on fighting to get these things

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
and keep on fighting to get these things
now<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.489> weird<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.060> did

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
now it's a little weird how they did

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
now it's a little weird how they did
this<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.659> depending<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> enemy<00:01:07.650> level<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this but depending on the enemy level in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
this but depending on the enemy level in
the<00:01:08.369> mission<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.790> playing<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.600> get

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the mission you're playing you will get

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
the mission you're playing you will get
different<00:01:10.080> types<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.710> tower<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.520> void<00:01:11.729> keys

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
