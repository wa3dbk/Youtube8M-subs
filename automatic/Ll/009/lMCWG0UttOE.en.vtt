planting element a sandy cove with water
in<00:00:10.980> Sydney<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.059> go<00:00:12.259> there<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> picture

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
in Sydney here we go there is a picture

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
in Sydney here we go there is a picture
I'm<00:00:14.160> using<00:00:14.540> and<00:00:16.340> right<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> Sydney<00:00:17.910> Harbour

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I'm using and right in Sydney Harbour

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm using and right in Sydney Harbour
itself<00:00:19.170> now<00:00:19.949> we're<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> paint<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
itself now we're going to paint this and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.529 
itself now we're going to paint this and
that<00:00:21.480> water<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:23.279> find<00:00:23.699> ourselves<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.300> water

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that water so we find ourselves a water

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.650 
that water so we find ourselves a water
color<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.220> this<00:00:26.220> turquoise<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
color and this turquoise with a bit of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
color and this turquoise with a bit of
yellow<00:00:28.250> really<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> beautiful<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.820> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
yellow really is a beautiful and it's so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.590 
yellow really is a beautiful and it's so
typical<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.899> those<00:00:34.469> coves<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.160> Sydney<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.510> I'll

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
typical of those coves in Sydney so I'll

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
typical of those coves in Sydney so I'll
just<00:00:36.780> move<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.920> against<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> hillock

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
just move it in up against the hillock

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.959 
just move it in up against the hillock
there<00:00:39.180> push<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.640> now

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
there push it up in there now

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
there push it up in there now
some<00:00:42.239> reflection<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.530> base<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
some reflection at the base of that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
some reflection at the base of that
because<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.940> hill<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.510> strain<00:00:45.780> reflection

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
because this hill is strain reflection

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.580 
because this hill is strain reflection
there<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:48.180> pretty<00:00:48.390> easy<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.350> just

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
there and that's pretty easy we just

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.250 
there and that's pretty easy we just
pull<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:49.890> from<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> top<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.899> push<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
pull it down from the top and push it in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.250 
pull it down from the top and push it in
where<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.690> purely<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
where that water is just purely a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
where that water is just purely a
reflective<00:00:55.920> surface<00:00:56.329> that<00:00:57.329> goes<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.750> there

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
reflective surface that goes from there

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.950 
reflective surface that goes from there
blue<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.039> nice<00:00:59.460> brown<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.719> sort<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
blue to that nice brown that's sort of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.359 
blue to that nice brown that's sort of
orangey<00:01:01.140> bring<00:01:01.620> up

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.789 

I'm<00:01:07.000> gonna<00:01:07.179> push<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.600> bit<00:01:07.630> further<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.259> clip

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
I'm gonna push it a bit further and clip

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.499 
I'm gonna push it a bit further and clip
some<00:01:09.009> more<00:01:09.159> yellow<00:01:09.399> in<00:01:09.520> there<00:01:09.850> that's<00:01:10.359> gonna

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
some more yellow in there that's gonna

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.080 
some more yellow in there that's gonna
really<00:01:10.899> make<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.380> eye<00:01:11.409> pop<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:12.850> now

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
really make the eye pop because now

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.270 
really make the eye pop because now
we're<00:01:13.299> just<00:01:13.450> not<00:01:13.719> seeing<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.439> brown<00:01:14.740> but<00:01:15.250> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
we're just not seeing one brown but a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.130 
we're just not seeing one brown but a
range<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:16.000> colors<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.569> there<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.020> they're

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
range of colors in there and they're

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.559 
range of colors in there and they're
warm<00:01:17.350> colors<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.130> they<00:01:18.609> balance<00:01:19.060> perfectly

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
warm colors and they balance perfectly

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.949 
warm colors and they balance perfectly

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
bit of white and notice how sloppy I've

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.169 
bit of white and notice how sloppy I've
got<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.590> mix<00:01:44.829> I<00:01:45.099> just<00:01:45.219> want<00:01:45.579> to<00:01:45.640> lay<00:01:45.849> it<00:01:46.030> in

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
got that mix I just want to lay it in

got that mix I just want to lay it in
and<00:01:46.390> get<00:01:46.569> it<00:01:46.689> covered<00:01:46.929> first<00:01:47.349> so<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.679> can<00:01:47.829> work

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
and get it covered first so I can work

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.990 
and get it covered first so I can work
on<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.250> later

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.609 

isn't<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:52.030> fresh<00:01:52.450> just<00:01:52.780> perfect<00:01:53.229> for<00:01:53.289> all

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
isn't that fresh just perfect for all

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.130 
isn't that fresh just perfect for all
these<00:01:53.920> things<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.479> don't<00:01:55.689> know<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.899> I'd<00:01:55.989> do

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
these things so I don't know what I'd do

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.459 
these things so I don't know what I'd do
without<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:57.179> little<00:01:58.179> bit<00:01:58.360> over<00:01:58.599> there<00:01:58.780> skip

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
without it a little bit over there skip

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.249 
without it a little bit over there skip
that<00:01:59.649> in<00:01:59.829> back<00:02:00.459> in<00:02:00.729> against<00:02:01.179> that<00:02:01.329> reflective

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
that in back in against that reflective

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.740 
that in back in against that reflective
brown<00:02:05.459> and<00:02:06.459> you<00:02:06.549> can<00:02:06.729> hear<00:02:06.969> that<00:02:07.000> brush<00:02:07.509> to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
brown and you can hear that brush to

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.919 
brown and you can hear that brush to
thing<00:02:08.319> its<00:02:08.440> way<00:02:08.649> across<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:09.220> canvas<00:02:09.929> that's

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
thing its way across the canvas that's

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.650 
thing its way across the canvas that's
pushing<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.590> cat<00:02:11.859> the<00:02:12.069> pigment<00:02:12.519> now<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.389> few

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
pushing the cat the pigment now a few

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.569
