00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.130 
of temperature there are no warnings
here<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.390> know<00:01:41.509> you've<00:01:41.660> connected<00:01:41.899> up

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
here then you know you've connected up

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.680 
here then you know you've connected up
the<00:01:42.229> heatsink<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.709> fan<00:01:42.800> correctly<00:01:43.640> over<00:01:44.509> here

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
the heatsink and fan correctly over here

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.749 
the heatsink and fan correctly over here
you<00:01:44.869> can<00:01:45.050> also<00:01:45.319> check<00:01:45.709> the<00:01:45.770> individual<00:01:46.429> fans

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
you can also check the individual fans

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.999 
you can also check the individual fans
of<00:01:47.119> running<00:01:47.420> properly<00:01:47.660> too<00:01:48.470> much<00:01:48.619> heat<00:01:48.830> can

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
of running properly too much heat can

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.130 
of running properly too much heat can
kill<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> PC<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.209> it's<00:01:50.330> essential<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.840> check

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
kill a PC so it's essential to check

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.980 
kill a PC so it's essential to check
that<00:01:51.289> these<00:01:51.440> are<00:01:51.560> working<00:01:51.890> properly<00:01:51.920> first

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
that these are working properly first

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.809 
that these are working properly first
all<00:01:53.990> looks<00:01:54.229> good<00:01:54.349> to<00:01:54.649> me<00:01:54.679> can<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.280> use<00:01:55.310> IE

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
all looks good to me can I use IE

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.719 
all looks good to me can I use IE
creation<00:01:56.390> then<00:01:56.569> almost<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:58.190> first<00:01:58.489> need<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
creation then almost we first need to

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.760 
creation then almost we first need to
install<00:01:59.090> windows<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.780> then<00:02:00.140> we're<00:02:00.530> ready<00:02:00.709> to

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
install windows and then we're ready to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.190 
install windows and then we're ready to
go<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.429> put<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.670> disk<00:02:01.880> in<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:02.509> reboot<00:02:02.869> to

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
go so put the disk in and then reboot to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.199 
go so put the disk in and then reboot to
start<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.530> installation<00:02:03.770> process<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:05.060> will

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
start the installation process this will

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.910 
start the installation process this will
take<00:02:05.239> a<00:02:05.390> while<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.899> let's<00:02:06.349> go<00:02:06.500> make<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.679> cup<00:02:06.860> of

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
take a while so let's go make a cup of

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.080 
take a while so let's go make a cup of
tea<00:02:07.009> we'll<00:02:07.550> see<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.759> when<00:02:07.849> it's<00:02:07.880> finished

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
that came with the motherboard now

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.320 
that came with the motherboard now
there's<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.099> install<00:02:28.459> all<00:02:28.670> option<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.300> which

there's an install all option here which

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.660 
there's an install all option here which
helps<00:02:29.810> speed<00:02:30.020> things<00:02:30.080> up<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:31.310> need<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> run

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
helps speed things up we need to run

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.550 
helps speed things up we need to run
this<00:02:31.700> first<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.360> drivers<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
this first for the drivers and then the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.680 
this first for the drivers and then the
utilities<00:02:34.100> said<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:34.940> going<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.420> then<00:02:35.570> we're

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
utilities said it going and then we're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.360

AI<00:02:42.760> suite<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.599> application<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:44.860> what<00:02:45.040> does

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
AI suite to application so what does

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.399 
AI suite to application so what does
this<00:02:45.250> let<00:02:45.459> me<00:02:45.579> do<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.989> basically<00:02:46.989> gives<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
this let me do it basically gives you

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.220 
this let me do it basically gives you
control<00:02:47.590> over<00:02:48.150> fine-tuning<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.209> PC<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.079> it's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
control over fine-tuning your PC so it's

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.380 
control over fine-tuning your PC so it's
set<00:02:50.409> up<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> best<00:02:50.829> way<00:02:51.069> for<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.430> for<00:02:51.970> example

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390

can<00:04:53.620> use<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.160> Smart<00:04:54.460> digi+<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.450> overclock<00:04:56.110> the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
can use the Smart digi+ to overclock the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.740 
can use the Smart digi+ to overclock the
pc<00:04:56.680> by<00:04:57.070> adjusting<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.490> voltages<00:04:58.000> but<00:04:58.570> more

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
pc by adjusting the voltages but more

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.390 
pc by adjusting the voltages but more
interestingly<00:04:58.960> we<00:04:59.590> can<00:04:59.740> also<00:04:59.920> use<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.370> to

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
interestingly we can also use it to

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.700 
interestingly we can also use it to
reduce<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.210> total<00:05:01.420> power<00:05:01.810> consumption<00:05:02.290> which

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
reduce the total power consumption which

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.990 
reduce the total power consumption which
will<00:05:02.860> save<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.190> money<00:05:03.340> on<00:05:03.490> your<00:05:03.610> electricity
