00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
everybody or while my solar wind system

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.810 
everybody or while my solar wind system
has<00:00:06.540> been<00:00:06.960> without<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.950> wind<00:00:08.280> part<00:00:09.230> I<00:00:10.820> really

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
has been without the wind part I really

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.709 
has been without the wind part I really
wanted<00:00:12.150> this

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
wanted this

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.250

so<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.240> got<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.930> 50<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:19.830> unit<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.939> gear<00:00:24.269> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so I got this 50 what unit the gear in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.669 
so I got this 50 what unit the gear in
the<00:00:25.019> motor<00:00:25.230> strip<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:28.550> got<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.900> new<00:00:30.900> model

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the motor strip and I got this new model

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.750 
the motor strip and I got this new model
a<00:00:32.189> pickle<00:00:32.910> unit<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.960> supposed<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.800> 125

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
a pickle unit was supposed to be 125

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.000 
a pickle unit was supposed to be 125
what<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:37.190> really<00:00:38.190> wanted<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> make<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.940> own<00:00:38.989> but

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
what I really wanted to make my own but
you<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.850> worry<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.270> years<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you need to worry about years and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.000 
you need to worry about years and
frictions<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.399> pulleys<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.890> advocate<00:00:46.890> an

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
frictions and pulleys and advocate an

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.900 
frictions and pulleys and advocate an
engineering<00:00:47.550> degree<00:00:47.850> also<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> ended<00:00:50.760> up

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
engineering degree also so I ended up

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.889 
engineering degree also so I ended up
with<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.469> unit<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.600> no<00:00:54.600> wind

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
with this unit I just put it up no wind

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.510 
with this unit I just put it up no wind
yet<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.469> can't<00:00:56.039> say<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.210> working<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.050> not

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
yet I can't say if it's working or not

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.010 
yet I can't say if it's working or not
if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.910> hear<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.690> again

if you hear from me again
that<00:01:01.350> means<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.920> working<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that means it's working if not then it's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.700 
that means it's working if not then it's
not<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.240> also<00:01:06.260> got<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:08.900> new<00:01:09.900> blue<00:01:10.350> neon
