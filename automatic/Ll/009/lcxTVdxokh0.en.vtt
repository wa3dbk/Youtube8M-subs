is<00:01:43.530> supposed<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.549> side<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
is supposed to be the right side and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
is supposed to be the right side and
yeah<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:47.040> does<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> look<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.799> don't

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
irregularly is to just look when you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
irregularly is to just look when you
invert<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.470> occasions

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
invert them over and on some occasions

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.859 
invert them over and on some occasions
you<00:01:56.040> even<00:01:56.310> get<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:56.520> felt<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.240> having<00:01:57.479> holes

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you even get your felt like having holes

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.109 
you even get your felt like having holes
in<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.880> too

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
in them or you know some of it are too

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.880 
in them or you know some of it are too
close<00:02:00.360> together<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> others<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.560> far

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
close together and the others I like far

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
close together and the others I like far
apart<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.850> isn't<00:02:03.030> professional

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
apart and it isn't professional

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840 
apart and it isn't professional
especially<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:04.860> hand<00:02:05.189> sewing<00:02:05.520> your

plushies and not machine sewing them if
your<00:02:08.700> machine<00:02:08.879> sewing<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.479> flashes<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
your machine sewing your flashes it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.250 
your machine sewing your flashes it
should<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.580> a-okay<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
should be a-okay and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.929 
should be a-okay and
but<00:02:12.590> then<00:02:12.709> they<00:02:12.860> look<00:02:12.980> really<00:02:13.159> neat<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
want to show you a comparison with the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.500 
want to show you a comparison with the
blanket<00:02:16.340> stitches<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.760> I've<00:02:16.879> done<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
pieces that we cut out and as you can

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.960 
pieces that we cut out and as you can
see<00:02:21.799> I've<00:02:22.129> done<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.489> small<00:02:22.760> blanket

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
see I've done really small blanket

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.490 
see I've done really small blanket
stitches<00:02:23.420> here<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.019> doesn't<00:02:24.379> really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
stitches here but it doesn't really

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.050 
stitches here but it doesn't really
matter<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.099> even<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.400> medium<00:02:25.849> size

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
matter you can even do medium size

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.449 
matter you can even do medium size
blanket<00:02:26.329> stitches<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.769> we<00:02:27.890> still<00:02:28.159> okay

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
blanket stitches and if we still okay

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.280 
blanket stitches and if we still okay
when<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.849> turn<00:02:29.030> them<00:02:29.150> around<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.629> I'm<00:02:30.140> gonna

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
when you turn them around and I'm gonna

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.020 
when you turn them around and I'm gonna
invert<00:02:30.650> them<00:02:30.829> right<00:02:30.980> now<00:02:33.489> now<00:02:34.489> as<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:34.970> see

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
invert them right now now as you can see

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.270 
invert them right now now as you can see
there<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.690> big<00:02:35.959> difference<00:02:36.170> between<00:02:36.680> how

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
there is a big difference between how

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.430 
there is a big difference between how
neat<00:02:37.579> they<00:02:37.790> are<00:02:37.970> even<00:02:38.599> though<00:02:38.780> your<00:02:39.109> stitches

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
neat they are even though your stitches

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.649 
neat they are even though your stitches
can't<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.859> seen<00:02:40.069> on<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.400> outside<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:41.420> they

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
can't be seen on the outside but they

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.809 
can't be seen on the outside but they
are<00:02:41.689> very<00:02:42.109> even<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.739> it's<00:02:43.220> sort<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> like

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
are very even and it's sort of like

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.119 
are very even and it's sort of like
neater<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:45.019> don't<00:02:45.200> even<00:02:45.379> have<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.769> be<00:02:46.099> a

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
neater and you don't even have to be a

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.699 
neater and you don't even have to be a
gap<00:02:46.519> or<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.150> know<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.450> little<00:02:47.720> things<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.409> I

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
gap or you know the little things that I

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.349 
gap or you know the little things that I
don't<00:02:48.829> really<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.250> when<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.909> do<00:02:50.090> three

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
don't really like when you do three

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.970 
don't really like when you do three
machines<00:02:50.870> okay<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:51.440> we're<00:02:51.560> gonna<00:02:51.650> start<00:02:51.889> by

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
machines okay so we're gonna start by

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.410 
machines okay so we're gonna start by
putting<00:02:52.099> everything<00:02:52.549> together<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.150> as<00:02:53.269> you

can see I've already put these two

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.140 
can see I've already put these two
pieces<00:02:54.680> together<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.519> it's<00:02:55.879> really<00:02:56.090> really

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
pieces together and it's really really

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.819 
pieces together and it's really really

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
things like bones I'm done okay so this

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.520 
things like bones I'm done okay so this
is<00:07:13.240> how<00:07:13.390> this<00:07:13.570> fountain<00:07:13.810> looks<00:07:14.020> like<00:07:14.200> once<00:07:14.410> a

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
is how this fountain looks like once a

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.350 
is how this fountain looks like once a
computer<00:07:14.920> and<00:07:15.100> once<00:07:15.280> again<00:07:15.400> is<00:07:15.730> really<00:07:15.910> unique

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
computer and once again is really unique

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.690 
computer and once again is really unique
it<00:07:17.320> might<00:07:17.620> take<00:07:17.800> you<00:07:17.920> some<00:07:17.950> practice<00:07:18.460> to<00:07:18.580> get

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
it might take you some practice to get

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.030 
it might take you some practice to get
that<00:07:19.210> is<00:07:19.360> to<00:07:19.390> just<00:07:19.510> this<00:07:19.840> small<00:07:20.200> but<00:07:20.860> don't

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
that is to just this small but don't

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.440 
that is to just this small but don't
worry<00:07:21.130> it<00:07:21.520> really<00:07:21.850> really<00:07:22.090> just<00:07:22.210> needs

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
worry it really really just needs

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.350 
worry it really really just needs
practice<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:23.230> yeah<00:07:24.220> I<00:07:24.400> guess<00:07:24.520> this<00:07:24.850> is<00:07:25.120> how

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
practice and yeah I guess this is how

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.090 
practice and yeah I guess this is how
the<00:07:25.690> snow<00:07:26.080> should<00:07:26.350> look<00:07:26.470> like<00:07:26.500> and<00:07:26.890> we're<00:07:27.010> just

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
the snow should look like and we're just

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.860 
the snow should look like and we're just
gonna<00:07:27.280> move<00:07:27.490> on<00:07:27.670> and<00:07:27.820> do<00:07:28.120> the<00:07:28.300> eyes<00:07:28.480> as<00:07:28.840> well

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
gonna move on and do the eyes as well

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.840 
gonna move on and do the eyes as well
the<00:07:29.590> eyes<00:07:29.770> can<00:07:29.950> get<00:07:30.100> a<00:07:30.130> little<00:07:30.340> bit<00:07:30.490> tricky

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
the eyes can get a little bit tricky

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.940 
the eyes can get a little bit tricky
because<00:07:31.000> it's<00:07:31.300> smaller<00:07:31.630> but<00:07:31.930> again<00:07:32.650> it's

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
because it's smaller but again it's

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.980 
because it's smaller but again it's
practice<00:07:33.490> you're<00:07:33.970> going<00:07:34.150> to<00:07:34.240> put<00:07:34.630> them<00:07:34.780> on

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
practice you're going to put them on

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.990 
practice you're going to put them on
using<00:07:35.590> a<00:07:35.710> blanket<00:07:36.130> stitch<00:07:36.280> you<00:07:36.490> can<00:07:36.640> find<00:07:36.850> it

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
using a blanket stitch you can find it

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.610 
using a blanket stitch you can find it
really<00:07:37.150> hard<00:07:37.360> to<00:07:37.480> do<00:07:37.780> another<00:07:38.170> stitch<00:07:38.440> with

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
really hard to do another stitch with

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.800 
really hard to do another stitch with
the<00:07:38.710> eyes<00:07:38.830> you<00:07:39.010> can<00:07:39.070> just<00:07:39.340> use<00:07:39.880> ifelse<00:07:40.360> it<00:07:40.630> fur

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.810 
the eyes you can just use ifelse it fur

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.960 
the eyes you can just use ifelse it fur
is<00:07:41.050> really<00:07:41.260> a<00:07:41.380> personal<00:07:41.770> preference<00:07:42.100> and<00:07:42.640> I'm

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970
