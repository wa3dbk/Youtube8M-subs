00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
because of all these different pieces

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.830 
because of all these different pieces
that<00:02:25.220> stick<00:02:25.550> out<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> shape<00:02:26.690> is

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
that stick out for me but the shape is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.190 
that stick out for me but the shape is
there<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.780> you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
there and you can use it for that if you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.790 
there and you can use it for that if you
want<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.220> main<00:02:31.400> thing<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.260> hear

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
want to but the main thing is to hear

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
want to but the main thing is to hear
the<00:02:34.690> squealing<00:02:35.690> mascot<00:02:36.410> squeal<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.580> my

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
the squealing mascot squeal so my

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.140 
the squealing mascot squeal so my
opinion<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.990> toy<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:39.920> an<00:02:40.040> OK<00:02:40.670> toy

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
opinion of this toy is it is an OK toy

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.510 
opinion of this toy is it is an OK toy
maybe<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.480> little<00:02:41.690> overpriced<00:02:42.350> for<00:02:43.130> what<00:02:43.190> you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
maybe a little overpriced for what you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.380 
maybe a little overpriced for what you
get<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.600> think<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.190> squeal<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:47.180> toy

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
get and I think the squeal of this toy

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.360 
get and I think the squeal of this toy
is<00:02:47.600> going<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:48.020> be<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> novelty<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:48.890> first<00:02:49.190> but

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
is going to be a novelty at first but

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.660 
is going to be a novelty at first but
then<00:02:49.580> will<00:02:49.850> become<00:02:50.030> very<00:02:50.959> boring<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.070> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
then will become very boring so then the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.090 
then will become very boring so then the
main<00:02:53.180> objective<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.260> will<00:02:54.620> then<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:54.980> be

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
main objective of this will then to be

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.780 
main objective of this will then to be
use<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.459> as<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.970> throwing<00:02:56.780> ball<00:02:57.020> but<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:57.470> again

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
use it as a throwing ball but then again

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.510
