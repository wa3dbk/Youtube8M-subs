there you go from new concepts are sit
there<00:00:15.780> guys<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.529> boxes<00:00:17.010> are<00:00:17.039> pretty<00:00:17.820> heavy

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
there guys these boxes are pretty heavy

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.660 
there guys these boxes are pretty heavy
I<00:00:18.270> don't<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:22.160> fairly<00:00:23.160> heavy<00:00:23.310> holds

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I don't know this one fairly heavy holds

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.650 
I don't know this one fairly heavy holds
about<00:00:23.869> 10<00:00:24.869> kilos<00:00:25.260> Oh<00:00:26.180> open<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.390> quickly

about 10 kilos Oh open these up quickly
i<00:00:27.810> hope<00:00:28.109> look<00:00:28.230> what's<00:00:28.410> inside

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:19.270 

hey<00:00:56.600> guys<00:01:14.979> let's<00:01:15.979> see<00:01:16.160> what<00:01:16.310> got<00:01:16.490> near<00:01:16.670> our<00:01:18.280> got

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
hey guys let's see what got near our got

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.230 
hey guys let's see what got near our got
a<00:01:19.550> line<00:01:20.119> fuse<00:01:20.540> hole<00:01:23.110> let's<00:01:24.110> mop<00:01:24.350> all<00:01:25.340> gauge<00:01:25.640> it

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
a line fuse hole let's mop all gauge it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.719 
a line fuse hole let's mop all gauge it
is<00:01:26.509> for<00:01:26.900> gage<00:01:27.110> oh<00:01:29.830> yeah<00:01:30.830> if<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.430> can<00:01:31.550> focus

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
is for gage oh yeah if you can focus

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.210 
is for gage oh yeah if you can focus
camera<00:01:32.180> focus<00:01:32.810> very<00:01:32.899> well<00:01:33.190> yeah

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.680 

full<00:01:37.910> gauge<00:01:38.120> flex<00:01:38.740> cable<00:01:39.740> where<00:01:43.240> did<00:01:44.240> not<00:01:44.420> want

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
full gauge flex cable where did not want

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.410 
full gauge flex cable where did not want
that<00:01:44.750> much<00:01:46.750> marine<00:01:47.750> terminals<00:01:49.060> quite<00:01:50.060> do<00:01:50.240> them

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
that much marine terminals quite do them

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.920 
that much marine terminals quite do them
think<00:01:50.960> about<00:01:51.220> five<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.370> each<00:01:55.630> speaker<00:01:56.630> boots

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
think about five of each speaker boots

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.980 
think about five of each speaker boots
to<00:01:57.560> go<00:01:57.710> at<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.890> end<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.040> my<00:01:58.160> speakers<00:02:04.690> my<00:02:05.690> 0

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to go at the end of my speakers my 0

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.910 
to go at the end of my speakers my 0
gauge<00:02:07.960> ground<00:02:08.960> wire<00:02:10.000> stuff<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.440> fire<00:02:12.440> it's

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
gauge ground wire stuff is fire it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:24.390 
gauge ground wire stuff is fire it's
pretty<00:02:13.730> heavy<00:02:19.570> today<00:02:20.570> goes

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.570 

what<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:27.130> don't<00:02:28.130> even<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.370> what<00:02:28.490> this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
what is this don't even know what this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.470 
what is this don't even know what this
is<00:02:29.770> that's<00:02:30.770> my<00:02:30.920> silver<00:02:31.220> plated<00:02:31.610> speaker<00:02:32.330> wire

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
is that's my silver plated speaker wire

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.800 
is that's my silver plated speaker wire
just<00:02:32.810> from<00:02:32.960> my<00:02:33.080> arm<00:02:34.330> sub<00:02:35.330> 2<00:02:35.660> amp<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.510> my

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
just from my arm sub 2 amp and that's my

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
just from my arm sub 2 amp and that's my
0<00:02:39.320> gauge<00:02:42.040> oxygen<00:02:43.040> free<00:02:43.250> copper<00:02:43.600> power<00:02:44.600> while

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
0 gauge oxygen free copper power while

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.110 
0 gauge oxygen free copper power while
it<00:02:46.430> stops<00:02:46.640> real<00:02:46.940> thick<00:02:47.240> bet<00:02:48.080> either<00:02:48.880> 0<00:02:49.880> gauge

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it stops real thick bet either 0 gauge

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.050 
it stops real thick bet either 0 gauge
on<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.360> market<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:52.130> definitely<00:02:52.580> worth<00:02:52.850> it

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
on the market so it definitely worth it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.280 
on the market so it definitely worth it
if<00:02:53.240> you're<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.190> want<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:56.050> invest<00:02:57.050> money

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
if you're if you want to invest money

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.630 
if you're if you want to invest money
it's<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.560> sound<00:02:57.770> system<00:02:57.890> I'll<00:02:58.220> definitely<00:02:58.370> go

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
it's a sound system I'll definitely go

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.750 
it's a sound system I'll definitely go
with<00:02:58.670> new<00:02:59.210> concepts<00:02:59.690> wiring<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.580> was<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760

together and hopefully my system should

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.250 
together and hopefully my system should
be<00:04:56.789> running<00:04:57.620> really<00:04:58.620> really<00:04:58.860> soon
