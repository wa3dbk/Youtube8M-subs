reintroduced<00:00:04.410> my<00:00:04.589> fast<00:00:04.980> rods<00:00:05.310> which<00:00:05.700> I

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
reintroduced my fast rods which I

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.550 
reintroduced my fast rods which I
considered<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.330> best<00:00:06.540> rod<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:07.049> ever<00:00:07.230> used

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560

on a skeet Reese rod okay

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.130 
on a skeet Reese rod okay
because<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.930> sensitivity<00:00:45.930> that's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
because you need that sensitivity that's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.330 
because you need that sensitivity that's
the<00:00:46.350> number<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.739> thing<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.039> keep<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.280> mind

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the number one thing to keep in mind

the number one thing to keep in mind
here<00:00:47.700> while<00:00:47.879> I'll<00:00:47.940> talk<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.149> those<00:00:48.719> rods

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
here while I'll talk about those rods

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
here while I'll talk about those rods
are<00:00:49.200> super<00:00:49.770> sensitive<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.270> fishing

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
are super sensitive and if I'm fishing

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080 
are super sensitive and if I'm fishing
any<00:00:51.930> bait<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.949> strike<00:00:53.340> occurs<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.940> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
any bait that a strike occurs with your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
any bait that a strike occurs with your
zucchini<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> strike<00:00:55.440> occurs<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
zucchini and the strike occurs on a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.819 
zucchini and the strike occurs on a
slack<00:00:56.309> line<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.170> high-tech

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
slack line that you need high-tech

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
slack line that you need high-tech
that's<00:00:59.699> sensitivity<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.899> here's<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's sensitivity but now here's the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.720 
that's sensitivity but now here's the
other<00:01:01.320> key<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.859> glass<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> here's<00:01:02.550> where

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
other key with glass and here's where

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.050 
other key with glass and here's where
the<00:01:02.760> science<00:01:03.180> started<00:01:03.570> glass<00:01:04.820> when<00:01:05.820> most

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the science started glass when most

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.030 
the science started glass when most
injure<00:01:06.330> strikes<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.780> currently<00:01:07.140> tightline

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
injure strikes are currently tightline

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940 
injure strikes are currently tightline
okay<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.840> want<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> sensitivity

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
okay you do not want that sensitivity

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.740 
okay you do not want that sensitivity
and<00:01:11.310> gives<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> story<00:01:12.210> behind<00:01:12.479> it

- semicircle like Guntersville Alabama I
was<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.619> third<00:01:34.950> place<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> 10<00:01:36.330> pitch

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
was in third place it was a 10 pitch

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
was in third place it was a 10 pitch
limit<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.289> I<00:01:37.560> only<00:01:37.920> had<00:01:38.130> seven<00:01:38.490> fish<00:01:38.700> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
limit back then I only had seven fish I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
limit back then I only had seven fish I
lost<00:01:39.210> six<00:01:39.570> fish<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.020> day

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
lost six fish that day

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
lost six fish that day
and<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:41.130> blew<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.640> brain<00:01:41.880> away<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and he blew my brain away because I

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.819 
and he blew my brain away because I
didn't<00:01:42.539> lose<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> many<00:01:43.079> fish<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> year

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
didn't lose that many fish in the year

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.550 
didn't lose that many fish in the year
but<00:01:44.670> here's<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.119> happened<00:01:45.539> right<00:01:46.110> before<00:01:46.289> we

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
but here's what happened right before we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.880 
but here's what happened right before we
left<00:01:46.740> for<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> classic<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.179> broke

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
left for the classic I was so broke

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.309 
left for the classic I was so broke
then<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.190> had<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.549> hock<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> shotgun<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.080> the

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
then I had to hock a shotgun to get the

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.130

sitting there and that fish starts to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
trying to move it in that split second

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.410 
trying to move it in that split second
to<00:04:08.989> die<00:04:09.140> last<00:04:09.440> now<00:04:09.830> in<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.190> hidden<00:04:10.519> class<00:04:11.060> didn't

to die last now in a hidden class didn't
have<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.630> sensitivity<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:13.099> that's<00:04:13.310> this

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
have that sensitivity so that's this
