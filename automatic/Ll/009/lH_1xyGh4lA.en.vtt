00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:36.980 

okay<00:01:20.570> no<00:01:21.570> auto<00:01:21.750> correction<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:35.720> all<00:01:36.720> right

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
so apart from fight not being able to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
so apart from fight not being able to

instead of dass or the other miss types

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.910 
instead of dass or the other miss types
were<00:01:47.040> pretty<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.439> pretty<00:01:49.439> accurately

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
were pretty pretty pretty accurately

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
were pretty pretty pretty accurately
corrected<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> will

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
corrected that's a good thing I will

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.620 
corrected that's a good thing I will
just<00:01:52.409> delete<00:01:53.280> everything<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.329> hop

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
just delete everything and now let's hop

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
just delete everything and now let's hop
into<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> settings<00:01:55.399> now<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.460> go<00:01:56.640> into<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
into the settings now we go into the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.039 
into the settings now we go into the
settings<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.329> themes<00:02:00.329> it

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
settings and we see the themes it

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.539 
settings and we see the themes it
actually<00:02:01.439> provides<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> things<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
actually provides a lot of things I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.999 
actually provides a lot of things I
believe<00:02:02.790> close<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> say

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
looks really horrible when you swipe

prediction<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.849> auto<00:02:32.060> correction<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.349> just

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
prediction is auto correction is I just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.610 
prediction is auto correction is I just
saw<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.580> good<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.300> mean<00:02:35.540> all<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:36.049> as<00:02:36.260> good<00:02:36.470> as

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
saw it's good I mean all not as good as

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.280 
saw it's good I mean all not as good as
Swift<00:02:36.920> key<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:37.849> thing<00:02:38.060> that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
Swift key that is the one thing that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.370 
Swift key that is the one thing that
swipe<00:02:39.290> can<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.799> improve<00:02:40.250> upon<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
swipe can really improve upon is the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.990 
swipe can really improve upon is the
auto<00:02:42.380> correction<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:43.010> good<00:02:43.340> I'm<00:02:43.610> not<00:02:43.670> saying

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
auto correction it's good I'm not saying

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.650 
auto correction it's good I'm not saying
it's<00:02:44.120> not

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
it's not

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's not
but<00:02:45.080> again<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.830> leader<00:02:46.069> in<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:46.760> aspect<00:02:47.239> of

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
but again the leader in this aspect of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.020 
but again the leader in this aspect of
SwiftKey<00:02:48.019> hands<00:02:48.470> down<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.340> auto<00:02:49.519> spacing<00:02:49.910> is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
SwiftKey hands down and auto spacing is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.440 
SwiftKey hands down and auto spacing is
fine

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
fine

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.600 
fine
next<00:02:50.840> word<00:02:51.230> prediction<00:02:51.500> okay<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.519> of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
next word prediction okay this is one of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.190 
next word prediction okay this is one of
the<00:02:52.700> other<00:02:53.480> thing<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.780> wanted<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.019> talk<00:02:54.170> about

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the other thing I wanted to talk about

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.550 
the other thing I wanted to talk about
is<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.849> next<00:02:56.269> word<00:02:56.540> prediction<00:02:56.870> in

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
is that the next word prediction in

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.270 
is that the next word prediction in
swipe<00:02:58.250> is<00:02:58.610> really<00:02:59.200> actually<00:03:00.200> below<00:03:00.470> par<00:03:00.739> quite

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
swipe is really actually below par quite

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.420 
swipe is really actually below par quite
frankly<00:03:01.640> it's<00:03:02.360> really<00:03:02.510> really<00:03:03.470> amazing<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:04.010> 50

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
frankly it's really really amazing in 50

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.900 
frankly it's really really amazing in 50
I<00:03:04.459> mean<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.360> 50<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.470> seems<00:03:06.769> as<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.730> can

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
I mean it's 50 it seems as if it can

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.620 
I mean it's 50 it seems as if it can
read<00:03:08.090> your<00:03:08.209> mind

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
read your mind

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.130 
read your mind
all<00:03:08.750> right<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.170> will<00:03:09.620> swipe<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:11.630> next<00:03:11.989> word

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
all right I will swipe the next word

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080 
all right I will swipe the next word
prediction<00:03:12.319> is<00:03:12.769> basically<00:03:13.130> non-existent<00:03:13.459> you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
prediction is basically non-existent you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.340 
prediction is basically non-existent you
know<00:03:14.180> although<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.600> there<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:14.959> option

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
know although it's there in the option

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.680 
know although it's there in the option
but<00:03:15.560> when<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.920> use<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.370> don't<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
but when you use it I don't think you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.490 
but when you use it I don't think you
will<00:03:17.810> be<00:03:18.019> able<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.530> find<00:03:18.769> much<00:03:19.190> help<00:03:19.459> in<00:03:19.609> this

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
will be able to find much help in this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.750 
will be able to find much help in this
when<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.620> comes<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:22.010> voice<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.489> handwriting

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
when it comes to voice and handwriting

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000 
when it comes to voice and handwriting
now<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.989> best<00:03:24.380> features

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
now this is what are the best features

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.500 
now this is what are the best features
okay<00:03:25.430> not<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.850> best<00:03:26.030> features<00:03:26.359> but

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
okay not the best features but

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.660 
okay not the best features but
personally<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.139> feature<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.190> find<00:03:28.519> it

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
personally the feature that I find it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.699 
personally the feature that I find it
very<00:03:28.700> useful<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.600> will<00:03:30.079> basically<00:03:30.230> do

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
very useful is and I will basically do

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.699 
very useful is and I will basically do
not<00:03:30.859> use<00:03:31.130> voice<00:03:32.109> voice<00:03:33.670> typing<00:03:34.670> or<00:03:34.970> voice

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
not use voice voice typing or voice

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.949 
not use voice voice typing or voice
speech<00:03:36.709> or<00:03:36.920> whatever<00:03:37.190> like<00:03:37.880> never<00:03:38.299> III<00:03:38.660> never

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
speech or whatever like never III never

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.800 
speech or whatever like never III never
use<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.590> never<00:03:40.010> ever<00:03:40.220> use<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.630> most

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
use it never ever use it and the most

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.660 
use it never ever use it and the most
irritating<00:03:42.079> part<00:03:42.620> about<00:03:42.889> other<00:03:43.100> keyboards<00:03:43.579> is

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
irritating part about other keyboards is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.509 
irritating part about other keyboards is
that<00:03:43.880> they<00:03:44.329> also<00:03:44.540> don't<00:03:44.840> use<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.200> but<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.560> that

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
that they also don't use it but the that

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.670 
that they also don't use it but the that
voice<00:03:46.790> keeps<00:03:47.120> still<00:03:47.480> there<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.019> in<00:03:48.530> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
voice keeps still there in the in the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.379 
voice keeps still there in the in the
main<00:03:48.859> keyboard<00:03:49.280> layout<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.519> really<00:03:50.030> hogs<00:03:50.269> up

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
main keyboard layout and really hogs up

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.479 
main keyboard layout and really hogs up
that<00:03:50.600> space<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.620> most<00:03:51.829> irritating<00:03:52.100> part

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
that space and the most irritating part

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.949 
that space and the most irritating part
is<00:03:52.579> when<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.730> actually<00:03:52.910> tap<00:03:53.269> on<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.660> you

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
is when I actually tap on it and you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.410 
is when I actually tap on it and you
know<00:03:54.139> it's<00:03:54.799> really<00:03:55.069> irritating<00:03:55.160> now<00:03:56.090> if<00:03:56.239> this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
know it's really irritating now if this

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.729 
know it's really irritating now if this
are<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.989> gives<00:03:57.139> me<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.380> option<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.680> actually

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
are it gives me the option to actually

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.129 
are it gives me the option to actually
remove<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.329> can<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.630> replaced<00:03:59.959> by

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
remove it so that it can be replaced by

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.610 
remove it so that it can be replaced by
a<00:04:00.549> comma<00:04:01.549> or<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.910> full<00:04:02.150> stop<00:04:02.450> or<00:04:02.569> whatever<00:04:02.840> so
