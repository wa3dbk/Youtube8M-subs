00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
this area right here so this is this is

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.029 
this area right here so this is this is
for<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.039> media<00:01:04.039> communication<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.149> so<00:01:05.299> on

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
the navigation is in the virtual screen

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.000 
the navigation is in the virtual screen
but<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:10.790> three-dimensional<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.630> can<00:01:11.810> see

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.219 

this<00:01:16.010> is<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.970> replacement<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:17.900> all<00:01:18.049> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
switches and so on Brown would be so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.020 
switches and so on Brown would be so
much<00:01:26.720> in<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.990> year
