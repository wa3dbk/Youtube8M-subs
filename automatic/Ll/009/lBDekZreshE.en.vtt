00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.510
 horrible 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.360
 it is that they pose them without laden 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.580
 the over 50 hours 6 back 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.110

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.610
 more normal than wanting to live his 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.610
 life 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.730
 they will be cops or officials 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.730

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.030
