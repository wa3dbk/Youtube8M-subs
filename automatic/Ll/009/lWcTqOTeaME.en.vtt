00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.949
 It is a flower to ia people This time the effect of the savanna diet 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.300
 I want to talk about it 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.420
 It is sold out that banana if it is that several times of the golden butterfly 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.329
 It seems that I did a table of such a while 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.960
 Right 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.009
 To reach 7 Asaba 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.839
 I think that the decider feels like to do anything 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.220
 I wonder if I would like to talk about that from the front 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.400
 previous 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 It seems like a river hero like eating bananas in the morning 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 It's a normal story 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.390
 Another minute 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.140
 Such a looking type 47 would not want a cylinder 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.560
 It's only about screaming, so it's general next to beauty 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.120
 I can not help you 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.240
 I'm thinking of getting the story of the second story gone 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.990
 First of all 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.140
 There is a story that it is not good for this stage 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 Though 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 Certainly it seems to be diversion 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.760
 Other usual condition 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 Sudden cancellation 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.900
 It is totally different from the study as it is generally said 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.950
 For example, it is a race that eats over 90% 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.290
 Because that distance is the people who eat meat 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.770
 That we are 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.080
 What is the common sense of nutrition that you already think is correct? 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.070
 Most of the exhibits were on display, but are not valid 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.520
 For example, Japan and Korea in the US 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 It is not necessary to cut the part of the mouth that can be covered with 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 I will refrain 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.470
 Two birds considerably 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.260
 It's forestry, so you're a merry forest nowadays 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.380
 Because it is a company that you want to listen to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.190
 But you are a provider right away 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.350
 Reading comprehension always falls into the category of the chairman 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.450
 But that season or land pattern 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.950
 Because Hino will by all means take a banana for one year 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.980
 Can sing 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.960
 It can not be said that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.890
 I can do it if I make a heart shape 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.140
 It is a stent 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.860
 Two banana tree industry group 1 who wins 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.640
 I'm sorry but it's not so good 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.380
 I think that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.219
 But it's a big event, that petite diet 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.189
 You mean people who succeed in a short period of time 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.340
 It's impossible if you don't get fat enough to succeed in a short period of time 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.019
 Just because I drew a banana diet this morning 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.509
 I can not expect it if I did not 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.509
 The reason is that there is no healthy shaft 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.589
 Good entertainment for the first year 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.339
 Please apply but I think there is an effect 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.319
 If there is entertainment 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.130
 Yeah 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.860
 The reason I think it's not particularly good in Akihabara is possible 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.459
 Bought life balance hidden balance force etc read and read 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.209
 I'm tired but I have a balanced nutrition 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.510
 The effects of nutrient balance are carbohydrate and lipid proteins 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.819
 And vitamin and mineral people have been included since 2005 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.909
 I'm going to give a dietary fiber, but this includes Western music 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.989
 The point is nutrition balance 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 This is the end of the nutrition balance, but if it is born, it will be in summer 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.469
 It is other site chemical that I am including in selfishness 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.149
 It is the dividend which is suppressing the color pcm of the fruit of the leader recently 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.019
 The rest seems to be high with that enzyme 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.509
 I've been doing that lately well nowadays 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.319
 Seven basic and seven 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.179
 Matsushita red and green 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.599
 It was a way of life not to get sick 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.430
 And Mr. Koichi Tanaka of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from Michido Works is Atsugi 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.819
 The research theme of the is being studied 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.439
 Every single human cell 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.319
 Sugar content 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.639
 There is balance 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.819
 There is no rise talking with children 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.900
 Besides that, it is a hormone 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.359
 Autonomic function 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.559
 No before entering 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:42.340
 Environmental videos also have debate 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.980
 Where the kit is included 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.139
 It is a loss, our 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.589
 By the time we live 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.289
 Nutritional balance in the village 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:52.569
 Gokgokgok 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.889
 It is that it is only part of the country 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.949
 For example, say recently, it is a fight chemical 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.359
 What does alcohol mean? 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.899
 It is exactly catechin or polyphenol 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:05.999
 f 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.399
 Flavonoid isoflavones were in the US but from the fiscal year 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.399
 Of love 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.399
 From the battle included in the core of the annual performed by the architect 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:14.960
 Nutritionist is official 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.170
 If this is included, they will be called students 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.540
 It's impossible, so even magazines and other equipment look at titles 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.090
 Management dietitian is saying freely with the fight chemical 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.999
 If 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.999
 That teacher is a teacher who is really studying really 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.480
 Can you give me a common name and talk about my home country? 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.890
 Also, if you are p2p then those who are studying to become a dietitian 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.879
 you know 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.029
 You can be an expert if you search for 400 people in the fight chemical circle. 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.840
 US titles lined up and featured in stores 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.729
 It is the best antioxidant action 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.749
 Anti-aging high but well reactive oxygen removal 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.990
 Then 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.400
 But degree 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.449
 If Deno speaks by mouth, it will be a place of activity 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.460
 There is vitamin k2 Hey hey CC by all south Station 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.779
 I'm sorry 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.270
 Polyphenol and the river 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.189
 The point is if you are in the fight chemical army 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.749
 Has an antioxidant effect of 70,000 sheets 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:11.169
 It is clear that there is 7 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.620
 Even if it is revealed under Niwada, 7 types of companies are about 100 types 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.169
 More than 10,000 types are evident from outside the prefecture if I want to 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.080
 It is said that 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.270
 So already 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.830
 If you think which one is more, think about boo from the site 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.139
 There is no nutritional balance at the point 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.490
 In the field of eating 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
 It is not only learning 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.830
 Any fruit late from the archipelago 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.629
 It seems to be in the field of view even in a stretch from the lawsuit 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.629
 It means that 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.050
 I can not say that each layer 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.940
 It is 108.75 inches that comes before can not expect high speed growth several times 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.900
 I suppose you were singing 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.460
 For example, if you show your body 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.470
 Vitamin or mineral and leather are only products 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.960
 It's a paced material and it's a product 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.319
 Well it is also the case with amino acids 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.630
 Make it a product 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.699
 Pre-act 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.699
 But it is an appeal that is necessary at that time 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:12.990
 That's why it's not thick 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.310
 There is a lot of stocking, but there is not enough water due to it 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.710
 Is it 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.779
 That's right I'm in public debt 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.080
 Investigate 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.559
 I'm sure the music is balanced when I broadcast it again 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.699
 When it's time to work, it's clear that it's sake and sake 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:28.819
 It has become 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.159
 Also along 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.270
 It's a completely different story from on balance 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.270
 Speaking of nutrition in today 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.850
 When it says fugitive diary unification, it is such an expression especially like plateau 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.360
 That's not the same as the glucose man's strike 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.360
 It is divided into more than 2003 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:50.879
 In the countryside 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:55.099
 It is divided into 200 kinds on the day and until that night cherry blossoms are also unified 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.259
 I'm brand Ishigiri 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.150
 Even if I think from now on, 30 types become clear in the first half 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.800
 From 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.029
 1st no matter what you think 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.730
 It's a magazine 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.780
 That one 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.260
 If it is temptation that is small, it will be cross country way 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.259
 What you can do naturally because you are not 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.770
 Than the same outside 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.840
 Originally made up of your area 1 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.779
 Drinks that were made 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.240
 Please be a fighting king 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.369
 That's what I wanted to say yesterday 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.909
 It is said that let's eat banana because this ingredient is good 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.249
 I'm not going at all, so the nutrition's too high 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.639
 I think I'll make it and get consent 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:34.839
 However 

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:35.910
 That's it 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.660
 Let's cherish what we can do quickly It is a word 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.440
 Already an expert we see from us January as an expert 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.509
 than 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:49.090
 Including many things naturally due to foreign-funded performance 

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:50.789
 is 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.360
 Natural things that are actually made more than experts at one time 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.569
 Because it is excellent 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.389
 Please take care of me. 

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:01.699
 fps so thank you very much
