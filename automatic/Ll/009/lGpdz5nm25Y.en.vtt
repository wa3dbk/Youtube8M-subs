 a scooter apron so it's a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.250
 product that may seem stupid but 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 in fact not so much here and there for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 winter 2015 and so baxter one of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.189
 OEMs who proposed apron 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.859
 for French scooters besides who 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.880
 offers us the winzip model and who 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.920
 brings a small batch of novelties 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 so here I present it to you on an mp3 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.670
 2014 so was lent sympathetically 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 by the confluence store team costs 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 and this winzip model actually is a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 apron says all season so the big 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.590
 more of this product so eddy multi 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.360
 season by its manufacturer 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.100
 it's actually you have the part 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 main apron the hot part 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.340
 who covers the legs she is actually 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.600
 removable what does when you go 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.579
 install on the apron on your 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 vehicle you go after being able to keep 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.699
 all year long even in summer while on 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 other models like you come in 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.870
 been fo to retype the disassembly and to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.399
 the following winter reassembly and these facts 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 in a very simple way actually 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 winter party so a classic apron 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.519
 with a big nylon exterior and a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.910
 inner fleece lining well 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.160
 hot 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 this part there in fact you can the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.450
 disconnected from the rest of the deck via a 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 big petanque there that makes all the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.030
 tower which in addition protected by a small 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.860
 low rat nylon 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.210
 so you take that off and you 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.260
 go into configuration was then 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.730
 obviously the bad languages ​​are going to me 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.250
 to say it's great it's even more 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.390
 simple flew that before that's not all to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.440
 true they still planned the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 blow they put two little eyelets 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.010
 in which you can place a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.360
 little padlock for the winter so on the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.360
 winter apron itself a few 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.580
 points emphasized 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.350
 first of all you have small strap 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 adjustment for whatever whatever 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.690
 your morphology 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 apron still snug on your 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780
 legs for not that cold air 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 rush inside you have 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.690
 also on the sides of the big 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.040
 reflective inserts for 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.590
 improve visibility what is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.570
 useless in winter or in the rain 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.860
 and then you also hid in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.450
 the doublet of heresy difficulties that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.560
 will prevent the apron from beating when 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 you are driving on fast lane 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.240
 note also that compared to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.620
 previous models the coating 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.570
 exterior has been improved for better 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.010
 resist uv avoid your apron 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.770
 take a little weird hues 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.690
 purple purplish pink then so when 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.040
 you are in summer you that there is a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 part of the apron that remain installed 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.210
 on the machine will as much put it to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.580
 profit you have a small dwelling that 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.960
 hide a small rain cover 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.700
 so like that even when you're in 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.489
 is and if ever 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 a little downpour you can go out and 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.459
 put it back just as easily 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.209
 little news to protect you people 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.680
 and finally two little details 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.640
 you have one covers the one that was 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.660
 hidden in the apron that will you 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.129
 allow to protect your this one 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.090
 you leave the vehicle out at night 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.069
 for example who will avoid you 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.239
 put your butt on a wet scene 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.720
 for example in the morning when you take 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.099
 the vehicle you have a small hatch 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.300
 to access the key switch and then 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.069
 there on our models on the mp3 and a 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.019
 small transparent window that allows 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.099
 to keep accessibility to different 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.819
 buttons so there on our models by 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.410
 example you have everything that is anti 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.989
 skating trunk lock etc

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.530
 something new to this category of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.690
