an<00:00:11.160> alpha<00:00:11.429> 65<00:00:12.000> Sony<00:00:12.360> camera<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.290> slap<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
an alpha 65 Sony camera and we slap on a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.609 
an alpha 65 Sony camera and we slap on a
Tamron<00:00:14.429> lens<00:00:14.750> we<00:00:15.750> use<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> hundred<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
Tamron lens we use the hundred and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.550 
Tamron lens we use the hundred and
eighty<00:00:16.710> millimeter<00:00:17.449> lens<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> one-to-one

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560

eighty millimeter lens it's a one-to-one
macro<00:00:20.160> works<00:00:20.430> great<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> base

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
macro works great it's got a base

which<00:00:24.420> makes<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> really<00:00:24.960> handy<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.710> us<00:00:25.910> it's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
which makes it really handy for us it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.450 
which makes it really handy for us it's
focusing<00:00:27.539> distance<00:00:27.930> again<00:00:28.260> 180<00:00:28.859> millimetres

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
focusing distance again 180 millimetres

focusing distance again 180 millimetres
its<00:00:30.119> apertures<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.560> F<00:00:31.710> 3.5<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
its apertures about an F 3.5 I think the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.569 
its apertures about an F 3.5 I think the
angle<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.200> view<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.829> about<00:00:35.070> fourteen

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
angle of view on this is about fourteen

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.350 
angle of view on this is about fourteen
degrees<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:37.309> think<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> overall<00:00:38.700> length<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
degrees I think the overall length is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920 
degrees I think the overall length is
somewhere<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:40.460> 167<00:00:41.460> 65<00:00:42.059> millimetres<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
somewhere around 167 65 millimetres and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
somewhere around 167 65 millimetres and
it<00:00:42.989> weighs<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.489> all<00:00:44.489> probably<00:00:45.390> close<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it weighs about all probably close to a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.760 
it weighs about all probably close to a
thousand<00:00:46.289> grams

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
thousand grams

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.510 
thousand grams

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
easy with a half of a turn here once I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.840

here in a second and then I'll even take
some<00:02:01.259> shots<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.640> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
some shots with it so that you can see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
some shots with it so that you can see
what<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.509> looks<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.140> here's<00:02:04.320> our<00:02:04.560> Sony

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what it looks like so here's our Sony

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.999 
what it looks like so here's our Sony
it's<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> slick<00:02:06.210> tripod<00:02:07.129> certainly<00:02:08.129> would

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it's on a slick tripod certainly would

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.240 
it's on a slick tripod certainly would
and<00:02:09.159> a<00:02:10.110> tripod<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.319> these<00:02:11.439> type<00:02:11.739> lenses

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and a tripod for these type lenses

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
and a tripod for these type lenses
otherwise<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.760> move<00:02:12.939> too<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.209> just<00:02:14.019> going

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
otherwise you move too much just going

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.479 
otherwise you move too much just going
to<00:02:14.230> take<00:02:14.379> off<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.709> one<00:02:14.829> on<00:02:15.010> there<00:02:15.220> that's<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to take off the one on there that's a

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.940 
to take off the one on there that's a
standard<00:02:15.879> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.349> 27<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.620> 100

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
standard I think 27 to about 100

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.580 
standard I think 27 to about 100
millimeter<00:02:18.310> lens<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.909> that's<00:02:19.569> also<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:20.019> Tamron

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
millimeter lens and that's also a Tamron

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.069 
millimeter lens and that's also a Tamron
I<00:02:21.129> particularly<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.360> Terrance<00:02:22.900> just

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
I particularly like Terrance just

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.149 
I particularly like Terrance just
because<00:02:23.349> they're<00:02:23.829> a<00:02:23.860> little<00:02:23.950> bit<00:02:24.129> more

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
because they're a little bit more

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.940 
because they're a little bit more
affordable<00:02:24.819> than<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.079> Sony's<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:26.349> icons<00:02:26.739> in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
affordable than the Sony's and icons in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.589 
affordable than the Sony's and icons in
the<00:02:27.040> Canon<00:02:27.489> actual<00:02:28.329> lenses<00:02:29.579> again<00:02:30.599> generic

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
the Canon actual lenses again generic

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.530 
the Canon actual lenses again generic
but<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.079> like<00:02:32.379> them<00:02:32.590> hooks<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.430> pretty<00:02:33.760> easy<00:02:34.060> one

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
but I like them hooks on pretty easy one

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.240 
but I like them hooks on pretty easy one
thing<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.870> want<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.109> do<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.709> when<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.159> hook

thing you want to do is when you hook

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.160 
thing you want to do is when you hook
these<00:02:36.459> on<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.030> want<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.299> move<00:02:37.480> over<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
these on is you want to move over to the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.470 
these on is you want to move over to the
mount<00:02:38.439> on<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.950> lens<00:02:39.299> balances<00:02:40.299> out<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
mount on the lens balances out the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.559 
mount on the lens balances out the
camera<00:02:40.989> better<00:02:41.170> makes<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.620> more<00:02:41.739> stable

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569
