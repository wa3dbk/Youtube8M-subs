 of our lives in the net the hammer game 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.700
 it was built around a goal 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.710
 the only thing that was to create a global base of 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.280
 games and we have a dedicated team 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.530
 that aspires to experience in everything 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.210
 which does the honor of developing a 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.090
 new call of duty for the next 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.240
 generation is a fact is a dream come true 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.090

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.979
 and is doing the work of our 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.780
 lives the next call of duty represents 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.420
 a new era for this incredible 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.299
 franchise we are anxious for 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.509
 share everything with what we have been 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.560
 working today is the beginning but there will be 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.500
 much more 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 The CEO of activision city leaders 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.579
 that it will be very complicated the name of 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.640
 electric hammer game sorry I'm telling you 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.310
 Well, you have full confidence that 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.170
 the title that you will develop can be 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.870
 the best tuti color that has been made 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.349
 never but good this is what always 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.769
 it is said not by his words can I 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.110
 deduce or we can deduce because it says 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.569
 very clear the next colloquium has 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.209
 presents a new era 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.400
 and in the first phase of the second paragraph 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.959
 it says quite clearly the honor of 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.469
 develop a new continent for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.109
 next generation does not talk about xbox 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.139
 360 and playstation3 so we can 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.420
 deduced lack of to explain it or 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.909
 more details than the next call of duty 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.790
 it has not happened and for playstation3 and xbox 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.639
 360 let's see this is a guess 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.930
 mine based on some statements that 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:58.930
 they really are quite definitive but 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.389
 I do not leave it quite clear and navigate 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.540
 you can compare them but that's what 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:08.280
 there are already you know commented like and favorites 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 and one thing next chao
