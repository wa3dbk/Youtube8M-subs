00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
but not rough at all it's super

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.110 
but not rough at all it's super
sensitive<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:22.160> made<00:03:22.489> for<00:03:22.700> sensitive<00:03:23.030> skin

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
sensitive it is made for sensitive skin

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.820 
sensitive it is made for sensitive skin
everything<00:03:23.810> about<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:24.530> beautiful

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
everything about it it's just beautiful

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.190 
everything about it it's just beautiful
and<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.580> used<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.880> use<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:26.300> harsher<00:03:26.840> cleansers

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
and I used to use like harsher cleansers

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.410 
and I used to use like harsher cleansers
but<00:03:27.410> since<00:03:27.800> my<00:03:27.980> skin<00:03:28.220> is<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.489> sensitive<00:03:28.670> this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
but since my skin is so sensitive this

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.479 
but since my skin is so sensitive this
is<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> one<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.019> really<00:03:30.260> works<00:03:30.739> for<00:03:31.010> me<00:03:31.160> from

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
is the one that really works for me from

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.759 
is the one that really works for me from
the<00:03:31.550> lush<00:03:31.820> line<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.050> ever<00:03:33.290> since<00:03:33.350> i've<00:03:33.650> been

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
the lush line and ever since i've been

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.170 
the lush line and ever since i've been
using<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.130> my<00:03:34.370> skin<00:03:34.640> has<00:03:34.760> been<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.120> much

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
using it my skin has been so much

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.120 
using it my skin has been so much
clearer<00:03:35.540> i<00:03:35.630> think<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.959> salt<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.739> helps<00:03:36.830> to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
clearer i think the salt really helps to

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.890 
clearer i think the salt really helps to
like<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.550> rid<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.820> acne<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.450> stuff<00:03:38.690> like

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
like get rid of the acne and stuff like

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.070 
like get rid of the acne and stuff like
that<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.400> after<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.730> i<00:03:40.970> use<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.720> bad

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
that and then after that i use this bad

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.860 
that and then after that i use this bad
boy<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.610> i<00:03:43.850> think<00:03:43.970> this<00:03:44.420> is<00:03:44.480> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
boy and this is so i think this is the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.800 
boy and this is so i think this is the
key<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.489> this<00:03:46.730> bar<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.299> split<00:03:47.600> into

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
key it is this bar that I split into

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.630 
key it is this bar that I split into
half<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.200> i<00:03:48.230> wouldn't<00:03:48.560> over<00:03:48.980> use<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.370> it's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
half so i wouldn't over use it it's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.039 
half so i wouldn't over use it it's
called<00:03:49.820> full<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.150> grace<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.900> a

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
called full of grace and it is a

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.190 
called full of grace and it is a
moisturizing<00:03:52.239> box<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.480> i<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:53.780> take<00:03:53.930> one<00:03:54.110> of

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
confused when they told me about this

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.060 
confused when they told me about this
but<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.660> was<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:49.229> free<00:04:49.380> sample<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:49.889> got

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
but it was just a free sample that I got

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.140 
but it was just a free sample that I got
but<00:04:50.220> I'm<00:04:50.310> definitely<00:04:50.520> going<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.060> be

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
but I'm definitely going to be

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.590 
but I'm definitely going to be
repurchasing<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:52.229> full-size<00:04:52.770> loaf<00:04:53.610> if<00:04:54.300> you
