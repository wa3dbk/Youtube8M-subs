point<00:00:02.790> out<00:00:02.970> something<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.929> don't<00:00:04.080> think<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.380> lot

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
point out something I don't think a lot

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.789 
point out something I don't think a lot

thousand that I own they're listed as
being<00:00:13.500> an<00:00:13.620> NPT<00:00:14.009> threading<00:00:14.580> which<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
being an NPT threading which is the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.730 
being an NPT threading which is the
American<00:00:15.509> Standard<00:00:16.550> but<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.760> look<00:00:18.740> that's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
American Standard but if you look that's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.529 
American Standard but if you look that's
exactly<00:00:20.400> parallel<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.029> each<00:00:21.060> other

exactly parallel with each other
that's<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.039> NPT<00:00:23.369> threading<00:00:23.939> head

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that's this is not an NPT threading head

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.980 
that's this is not an NPT threading head
NPT<00:00:25.019> stands<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.619> national<00:00:26.039> pipe<00:00:26.660> thread<00:00:27.660> or

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
NPT stands for national pipe thread or

NPT stands for national pipe thread or
national<00:00:28.830> pipe<00:00:29.010> tapers<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> lot<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.880> people

national pipe tapers a lot of people
call<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.720> reason<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.140> called<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.439> tapers

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
call it the reason it's called a tapers

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
call it the reason it's called a tapers
because<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> top<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.510> should<00:00:33.660> be

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
because here at the top it should be

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.139 
because here at the top it should be
smaller<00:00:34.200> than<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.460> base<00:00:35.670> that's

smaller than here at the base that's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.280 
smaller than here at the base that's
that's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> American<00:00:37.500> Standard<00:00:39.140> here's<00:00:40.140> what

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that's the American Standard here's what

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.130 
that's the American Standard here's what
happens<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.980> try<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.370> an<00:00:41.579> NPT

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
happens when you try and take an NPT

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.389 
happens when you try and take an NPT
fitting<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> screw<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> onto<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.800> well<00:00:46.800> I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
fitting and screw it onto this well I'm

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
fitting and screw it onto this well I'm
all<00:00:47.610> done<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:48.989> screws<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> got

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
all done that was what two screws I got

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.290 
all done that was what two screws I got
all<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> thread<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
all this thread this is not not what you

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
all this thread this is not not what you
do<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.910> BSP<00:00:56.910> adapter<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
do so what you need is a BSP adapter I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750 
do so what you need is a BSP adapter I
already<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.780> mine<00:00:58.020> glued<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> Union<00:00:59.579> but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
already have mine glued into a Union but

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.099 
already have mine glued into a Union but
I<00:00:59.820> figured<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> should<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> video

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I figured I should probably make a video

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
I figured I should probably make a video
for<00:01:01.320> other<00:01:01.620> people<00:01:02.070> here's<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.879> happens

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
for other people here's what happens

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329 
for other people here's what happens
when<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> screw<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> BSP<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.559> British<00:01:04.890> standard

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
when you screw a BSP or British standard

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.740 
when you screw a BSP or British standard
pipe<00:01:05.580> thread<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.770> G<00:01:07.950> balance<00:01:11.750> that's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pipe thread on to the G balance that's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
pipe thread on to the G balance that's
easy

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
easy

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.539 
easy

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
Wow it's going all the way down a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
Wow it's going all the way down a little
hard<00:01:20.700> doing<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.000> one-handed<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
hard doing this one-handed you get the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
hard doing this one-handed you get the
idea<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.740> down

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
idea this thing goes all the way down

finger<00:01:26.549> tight<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.600> left<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.229> an

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
finger tight you're left with about an

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
finger tight you're left with about an
inch<00:01:28.530> that's<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.520> torque<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> down<00:01:30.060> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
inch that's when you torque it down with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.740 
inch that's when you torque it down with
a<00:01:30.270> wrench

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
a wrench

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.319 
a wrench
what<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> people<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:31.920> doing<00:01:32.329> is

what a lot of people are doing is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.380 
what a lot of people are doing is
they're<00:01:33.570> taking<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.650> NPT<00:01:35.280> thread<00:01:35.579> right

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
they're taking the NPT thread right

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
they're taking the NPT thread right
they're<00:01:37.020> putting<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> BSP<00:01:38.159> male

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they're putting it on the BSP male

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
they're putting it on the BSP male
fitting<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.990> taking<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.650> wrench<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
fitting and just taking a wrench to it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bunch of stress on it don't do that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.160 
bunch of stress on it don't do that
get<00:01:46.439> yourself<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> BSP<00:01:47.280> adapter<00:01:47.930> screw<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.990> down

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
get yourself a BSP adapter screw it down

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.850 
get yourself a BSP adapter screw it down
with<00:01:50.100> finger<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.329> hand<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:52.470> easy
