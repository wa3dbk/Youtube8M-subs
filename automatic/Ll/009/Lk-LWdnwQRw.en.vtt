pretty<00:00:14.670> good<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.269> see<00:00:15.330> our<00:00:15.450> company

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
pretty good as you can see our company

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.939 
pretty good as you can see our company
on<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:15.990> bench<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.500> not<00:00:16.619> sure<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.859> I

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
on the bench so I'm not sure if I

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.500 
on the bench so I'm not sure if I
preferred<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> chemistry<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.090> mean<00:00:18.449> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
preferred out of the chemistry I mean I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.060 
preferred out of the chemistry I mean I
want<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.750> pop<00:00:18.900> them<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.109> team<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.680> but

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.590 
want to pop them in the team here but
then<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.250> goes<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.670> 72<00:00:21.000> chemistry<00:00:21.510> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
then it goes out of 72 chemistry it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540 
then it goes out of 72 chemistry it
looks<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.869> dirty<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.920> don't<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.369> really
