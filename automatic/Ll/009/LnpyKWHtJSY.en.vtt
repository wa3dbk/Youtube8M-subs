has kind of a gap worthy you know button

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.110 
has kind of a gap worthy you know button
goes<00:03:25.709> okay<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.860> far<00:03:27.099> as<00:03:27.190> for<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.610> topcoat

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120

goes okay as far as for the topcoat
which<00:03:28.150> goes<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.810> used<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.099> first<00:03:30.130> time<00:03:30.459> Mod

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
which goes I used for the first time Mod

Podge and I started with the iReal art
brush<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:34.690> as<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.590> saw<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:35.950> drawing<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:36.760> able

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
brush but as I saw it drawing I was able

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.960 
brush but as I saw it drawing I was able
to<00:03:37.269> just<00:03:37.720> see<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.049> lines<00:03:38.319> of<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.129> brush<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.910> I

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
to just see the lines of the brush so I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.059 
to just see the lines of the brush so I
decided<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.480> switch<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.260> last<00:03:41.470> moment<00:03:41.860> to

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
decided to switch in the last moment to

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.550 
decided to switch in the last moment to
using<00:03:42.519> my<00:03:42.849> sponge<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:44.140> applying<00:03:44.470> a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
was like this is after two days of

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.960 
was like this is after two days of
lighting<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.590> whole<00:04:32.620> thing<00:04:32.950> dry<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.760> was

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
lighting the whole thing dry it was

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.690 
lighting the whole thing dry it was
taking<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.450> long<00:04:34.720> time<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.050> dry<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.650> set<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.610> it

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
taking a long time to dry and set so it

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.180 
taking a long time to dry and set so it
just<00:04:37.000> decided<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.389> take<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.990> whole<00:04:38.200> sit<00:04:38.800> back

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
just decided to take the whole sit back

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.730 
just decided to take the whole sit back
away<00:04:39.849> so<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.630> how<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.840> final<00:04:41.080> product

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
away so this is how the final product

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.580 
away so this is how the final product
looks<00:04:42.099> like<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.490> really<00:04:42.910> like<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.389> sign<00:04:43.690> but

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
looks like I really like the sign but

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.490 
looks like I really like the sign but
again<00:04:45.220> with<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.880> finish<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.660> am<00:04:46.780> not<00:04:47.080> really

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
again with that finish I am not really

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.190 
again with that finish I am not really
sure<00:04:47.620> about<00:04:47.979> some<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.460> like<00:04:48.610> super<00:04:49.090> smooth<00:04:50.020> or

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
sure about some of like super smooth or

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.659 
sure about some of like super smooth or
anything<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.650> I'm<00:04:50.919> still<00:04:51.280> working

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669

this like last week

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.550 
this like last week
maybe<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:58.479> weather<00:04:58.930> has<00:04:59.080> been<00:04:59.260> like

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
maybe it's because weather has been like

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.709 
maybe it's because weather has been like
rainy<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.280> stuff
