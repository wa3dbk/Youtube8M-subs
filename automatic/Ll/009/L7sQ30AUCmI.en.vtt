she dropped another five seconds to

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.349 
she dropped another five seconds to
found<00:04:39.099> their<00:04:39.249> limit<00:04:39.549> just<00:04:39.879> a<00:04:39.969> little<00:04:40.149> bit<00:04:40.269> off

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:40.359 
found their limit just a little bit off

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:48.869 
found their limit just a little bit off
this

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.669 

I<00:04:48.909> think<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:49.629> back<00:04:49.779> wheels<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.319> little<00:04:50.559> bit

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:50.679 
I think the back wheels a little bit

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:53.699 
I think the back wheels a little bit
more<00:04:51.219> out<00:04:51.429> of<00:04:51.459> balance<00:04:52.179> and<00:04:52.629> it's<00:04:53.439> even<00:04:53.679> more

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:53.709 
more out of balance and it's even more

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:56.070 
more out of balance and it's even more
noticeable<00:04:54.279> and<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:55.539> then<00:04:55.629> obviously<00:04:55.779> it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
noticeable and and then obviously it

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.179 
noticeable and and then obviously it
overheated<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.889> little<00:04:57.069> bit<00:04:57.189> cooked<00:04:57.759> it<00:04:59.189> you

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:00.189 
overheated a little bit cooked it you

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.619 
overheated a little bit cooked it you
dropped<00:05:00.369> another<00:05:00.550> five<00:05:00.789> seconds<00:05:01.209> we've<00:05:01.509> got

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
dropped another five seconds we've got

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.299 
dropped another five seconds we've got
in<00:05:01.719> develop<00:05:02.020> money<00:05:02.139> money<00:05:02.349> so<00:05:02.919> that's

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:03.309 
in develop money money so that's

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.100 
in develop money money so that's
fantastic

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
fantastic

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.799 
fantastic
15<00:05:05.110> second<00:05:05.469> drop<00:05:05.649> from<00:05:05.770> yesterday<00:05:06.569> we<00:05:07.569> made<00:05:07.749> a

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 
15 second drop from yesterday we made a

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.139 
15 second drop from yesterday we made a
few<00:05:08.080> changes<00:05:08.110> from<00:05:08.740> this<00:05:08.860> morning<00:05:09.309> and<00:05:09.459> we

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.149 
few changes from this morning and we

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:12.449 
few changes from this morning and we
gave<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.509> pretty<00:05:11.199> much<00:05:11.349> full<00:05:11.589> power<00:05:11.830> for

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:12.459 
gave it pretty much full power for

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.519 
gave it pretty much full power for
everything<00:05:12.939> back<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.509> back<00:05:13.929> to<00:05:14.050> regen<00:05:14.409> off

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:14.529 
everything back to back to regen off

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.669 
everything back to back to regen off
because<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.699> really<00:05:15.909> didn't<00:05:16.119> feel<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.419> that

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:16.679 
because I really didn't feel that that

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:20.909 
because I really didn't feel that that
assisted<00:05:17.679> the<00:05:17.740> braking<00:05:18.129> anyway<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:20.020> we're

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
assisted the braking anyway and we're

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.230 
assisted the braking anyway and we're
still<00:05:21.099> in<00:05:21.129> a<00:05:21.219> few<00:05:21.429> issues<00:05:21.759> there<00:05:22.119> was

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
still in a few issues there was

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.329 
still in a few issues there was
suspension<00:05:22.689> and<00:05:22.809> obviously<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.860> overheated

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:24.339 
suspension and obviously it overheated

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:29.999 
suspension and obviously it overheated
but<00:05:27.059> ideally<00:05:28.059> it's<00:05:28.300> it's<00:05:28.749> you<00:05:29.619> know<00:05:29.769> three<00:05:29.919> or

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
but ideally it's it's you know three or

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.589 
but ideally it's it's you know three or
four<00:05:30.099> laps<00:05:30.459> it's<00:05:30.699> it's<00:05:31.059> getting<00:05:31.209> a<00:05:31.360> lot<00:05:31.479> better

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
four laps it's it's getting a lot better

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.619 
four laps it's it's getting a lot better
we've<00:05:31.839> got<00:05:31.959> 15<00:05:32.319> seconds<00:05:32.709> on<00:05:32.860> in<00:05:33.279> a<00:05:33.399> day<00:05:33.550> so

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
we've got 15 seconds on in a day so

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.540 
we've got 15 seconds on in a day so
that's<00:05:34.629> pretty<00:05:34.869> good

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.610 

no<00:05:38.120> one

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
I've taken everything might have got

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.640 
I've taken everything might have got
high<00:05:44.580> but<00:05:45.510> it's<00:05:45.630> not<00:05:45.690> as<00:05:45.900> hot<00:05:46.050> as<00:05:46.080> last<00:05:46.380> night

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
battery power slider it will accelerate

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:06.250 
battery power slider it will accelerate
that<00:05:57.870> as<00:05:58.020> well<00:06:00.710> I'm<00:06:01.710> exactly<00:06:02.340> here<00:06:02.550> Friday<00:06:02.760> so

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
very it was very satisfying what should
