00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
everyone this specific configuration

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.839 
everyone this specific configuration
will<00:03:09.540> set<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> back<00:03:09.870> roughly<00:03:10.290> 3200<00:03:11.099> dollars

which definitely made my wallet sad but

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.530 
which definitely made my wallet sad but
it's<00:03:14.280> also<00:03:14.459> nice<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.239> I'll<00:03:15.329> have<00:03:15.360> a
