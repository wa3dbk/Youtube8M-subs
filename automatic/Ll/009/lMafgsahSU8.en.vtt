because<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.210> my<00:02:22.420> earlier<00:02:22.840> comments<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
because of my earlier comments in the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.990 
because of my earlier comments in the
year<00:02:23.530> when<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.740> said<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.640> doesn't<00:02:24.910> feel

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
year when I said that it doesn't feel

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.730 
year when I said that it doesn't feel
like<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.180> ridge<00:02:25.420> racer<00:02:25.630> title<00:02:26.140> but<00:02:26.350> I'd<00:02:26.440> stand

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
like a ridge racer title but I'd stand

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.990 
like a ridge racer title but I'd stand
by<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.250> doesn't<00:02:27.490> feel<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> ridge

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
by that it doesn't feel like a ridge

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.340 
by that it doesn't feel like a ridge
racer<00:02:28.180> title<00:02:28.720> i'm<00:02:28.870> away<00:02:29.080> from<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350

just wish they hadn't done that and just

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.449 
just wish they hadn't done that and just
created<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.540> new<00:02:37.780> brand<00:02:38.110> obviously<00:02:39.040> looking<00:02:39.220> at

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
created a new brand obviously looking at

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.580 
created a new brand obviously looking at
it<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.730> very<00:02:39.940> much<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.600> cross<00:02:40.870> between<00:02:41.050> I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it it's very much a cross between I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.360 
it it's very much a cross between I

environments are very destructible it
does<00:02:58.900> look<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.230> very<00:02:59.500> early<00:02:59.800> version<00:03:00.450> some

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
does look like a very early version some

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.470 
does look like a very early version some
of<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.720> cars<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.320> some<00:03:03.190> scenes<00:03:03.489> look<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
of the cars in some scenes look like the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.990 
of the cars in some scenes look like the
not<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> part<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> background<00:03:06.000> something

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
not a part of the background something

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.160 
not a part of the background something
that<00:03:07.090> needs<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.330> lot<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.510> work<00:03:07.600> at<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:07.959> stage

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that needs a lot of work at this stage

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.360 
that needs a lot of work at this stage
maybe<00:03:08.410> they're<00:03:08.560> showing<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:08.890> too<00:03:09.040> early<00:03:09.100> i

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
maybe they're showing it too early i

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.500

actually due for launch so at the moment

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.660 
actually due for launch so at the moment
it<00:03:12.790> looks<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> nice<00:03:13.540> arcade<00:03:14.410> rump<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.430> you
