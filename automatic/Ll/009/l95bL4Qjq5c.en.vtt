00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.480 

in<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:05.779> film<00:00:06.080> I'm<00:00:06.379> gonna<00:00:06.620> look<00:00:06.769> at<00:00:06.919> automatic

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
in this film I'm gonna look at automatic

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.060 
in this film I'm gonna look at automatic
control<00:00:07.879> of<00:00:08.059> a<00:00:08.149> push-pull<00:00:08.719> train<00:00:09.139> using<00:00:09.830> that

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
control of a push-pull train using that

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.240 
control of a push-pull train using that
the<00:00:10.280> lens<00:00:10.730> bm1<00:00:11.240> brake<00:00:11.780> module<00:00:12.110> one<00:00:12.320> in

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
the lens bm1 brake module one in

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.490 
the lens bm1 brake module one in
conjunction<00:00:13.820> with<00:00:14.059> a<00:00:14.269> lens<00:00:14.540> silver<00:00:15.110> or<00:00:15.259> gold

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
conjunction with a lens silver or gold

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.310 
conjunction with a lens silver or gold
series<00:00:15.830> decoder<00:00:16.930> locus<00:00:17.930> here<00:00:18.110> on<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
series decoder locus here on the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.200 
series decoder locus here on the
programming<00:00:18.710> track<00:00:20.050> I'm<00:00:21.050> going<00:00:21.110> to<00:00:21.439> just<00:00:22.210> turn

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
programming track I'm going to just turn

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.499 
programming track I'm going to just turn
the<00:00:23.649> ABC<00:00:24.649> on<00:00:24.829> but<00:00:25.279> also<00:00:25.460> turn<00:00:25.849> on<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
the ABC on but also turn on the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.470 
the ABC on but also turn on the
push-pull<00:00:27.290> mode<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:29.180> it's<00:00:29.329> in<00:00:29.450> CB<00:00:29.779> 51<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:32.360> we

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
push-pull mode so it's in CB 51 and we

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.330 
push-pull mode so it's in CB 51 and we
put<00:00:32.689> in<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.960> value<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.440> 10<00:00:33.860> this<00:00:34.460> time

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
put in the value of 10 this time

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.850 
put in the value of 10 this time
so<00:00:37.340> you<00:00:37.399> see<00:00:37.640> bit<00:00:37.910> -<00:00:38.210> which<00:00:38.750> turns<00:00:39.110> on<00:00:39.320> ABC

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
so you see bit - which turns on ABC

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.250 
so you see bit - which turns on ABC
breaking<00:00:40.400> and<00:00:40.610> bit<00:00:41.000> for<00:00:41.330> which<00:00:41.600> turns<00:00:41.900> on<00:00:42.080> the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
breaking and bit for which turns on the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.450 
breaking and bit for which turns on the
push-pull<00:00:42.770> ah<00:00:43.240> lit<00:00:44.240> up<00:00:44.420> there<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:48.710> push-pull

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
push-pull ah lit up there the push-pull

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.080 
push-pull ah lit up there the push-pull
function<00:00:50.440> turned<00:00:51.440> on<00:00:51.650> you<00:00:51.950> can<00:00:51.980> also<00:00:52.370> set<00:00:53.060> up

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
function turned on you can also set up

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.630 
function turned on you can also set up
the<00:00:53.660> delay<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.710> time<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.100> train<00:00:55.310> weights

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the delay that the time to train weights

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.930 
the delay that the time to train weights
before<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.210> changes<00:00:56.540> direction<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:59.300> in<00:00:59.540> CB<00:00:59.960> 54

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
before it changes direction so in CB 54

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.660 
before it changes direction so in CB 54
the<00:01:01.940> default<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.480> 4<00:01:02.780> seconds<00:01:03.430> what<00:01:04.430> I'm<00:01:04.519> gonna

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
the default is 4 seconds what I'm gonna

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.629 
the default is 4 seconds what I'm gonna
do<00:01:04.939> is<00:01:05.269> reduce<00:01:05.810> that<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.799> just<00:01:07.040> 2<00:01:07.250> seconds

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:09.639 
do is reduce that to just 2 seconds

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:12.309 
do is reduce that to just 2 seconds
something<00:01:10.639> that<00:01:10.819> crosses<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.210> decoder<00:01:11.509> just

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
something that crosses the decoder just

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.120 
something that crosses the decoder just
to<00:01:12.439> make<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.710> video<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.950> little<00:01:13.130> bit<00:01:13.249> quicker

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
to make the video a little bit quicker

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.950 
to make the video a little bit quicker
so<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.399> train<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:17.149> approaching<00:01:17.329> they're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so now the train is approaching they're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.949 
so now the train is approaching they're
they're<00:01:18.200> breaking<00:01:18.530> module<00:01:19.299> it's<00:01:20.299> gonna<00:01:20.539> slow

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
they're breaking module it's gonna slow

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.370 
they're breaking module it's gonna slow
down<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.409> stop<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:23.929> it<00:01:23.990> changes

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
down and stop you see it changes

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.959 
down and stop you see it changes
direction<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.920> lights<00:01:25.130> come<00:01:25.459> on<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.819> other

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
direction the lights come on the other

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.910 
direction the lights come on the other
end<00:01:26.149> it<00:01:26.569> waits<00:01:26.810> 2<00:01:27.049> seconds<00:01:27.530> which<00:01:27.679> refers<00:01:27.859> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
end it waits 2 seconds which refers to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.179 
end it waits 2 seconds which refers to
the<00:01:28.069> delay<00:01:28.310> offset<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.810> can<00:01:29.959> put<00:01:30.079> up<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.380> 255

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
the delay offset you can put up to 255

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.160 
the delay offset you can put up to 255
seconds<00:01:31.759> as<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.359> maximum

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.870 

go<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.770> end<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.250> little

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
go down to the other end my little

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.130 
go down to the other end my little
layout<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.910> you'll<00:01:41.910> see<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> other<00:01:42.480> BM

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
layout here and you'll see the other BM

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.730 
layout here and you'll see the other BM
module<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:45.050> again<00:01:46.050> slow<00:01:46.380> down<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
module down there again slow down to a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.080 
module down there again slow down to a
halt<00:01:47.120> change<00:01:48.120> direction<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.410> then<00:01:50.280> resume<00:01:50.730> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
halt change direction and then resume in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
halt change direction and then resume in
the<00:01:51.270> other<00:01:51.390> direction<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.580> want<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the other direction do you want a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.900 
the other direction do you want a
locomotive<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> drive<00:01:57.810> through<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.410> BM<00:01:59.100> section

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
locomotive to drive through a BM section

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.450 
locomotive to drive through a BM section
and<00:02:00.150> ignore<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.650> turn<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.040> function

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and ignore it if you turn to function

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.400 
and ignore it if you turn to function
three<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.220> shunting<00:02:05.700> mode<00:02:06.380> then<00:02:07.380> the
