00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
really beneficial and it's just not what

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
really beneficial and it's just not what
my<00:01:30.990> channel<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
my channel is about so that's what I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
my channel is about so that's what I
think<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> Bob<00:01:33.210> city<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.659> state<00:01:33.840> i

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
think about the Bob city and state i

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
think about the Bob city and state i
think<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.710> very<00:01:35.040> helpful<00:01:35.220> having<00:01:35.520> up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
think it's very very helpful having up

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
think it's very very helpful having up
one<00:01:36.030> mobility<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.020> upping<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> damage

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
one mobility and then upping the damage

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
one mobility and then upping the damage
by<00:01:38.130> two<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> weapon<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.090> already<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
by two on a weapon that's already so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
by two on a weapon that's already so
powerful<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> bowel<00:01:40.500> 27<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.520> makes<00:01:41.909> an

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
powerful like the bowel 27 it makes an

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.429 
powerful like the bowel 27 it makes an
absolute<00:01:42.420> monster<00:01:42.630> plus<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.259> really

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
absolute monster plus you're really

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.810 
absolute monster plus you're really
cool-looking<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.430> cool<00:01:44.549> looking

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
cool-looking the really cool looking

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
cool-looking the really cool looking
like<00:01:44.970> royalty<00:01:45.390> type<00:01:45.570> cam<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.259> because

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
like royalty type cam on it just because

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
like royalty type cam on it just because
it's<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.770> elite<00:01:47.009> weapon<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.399> general<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.119> now

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it's an elite weapon in general but now

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's an elite weapon in general but now
let's<00:01:48.479> take<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> competitor<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
let's take a look at the competitor the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.210 
let's take a look at the competitor the
bowel<00:01:50.280> 27<00:01:50.850> inferno<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> fan<00:01:52.470> favorite<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
bowel 27 inferno not the fan favorite so

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.200 
bowel 27 inferno not the fan favorite so
let's<00:01:53.369> take<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> look<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
let's take a look at this one but I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.340 
let's take a look at this one but I
still<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> gives<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> run<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.140> its

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
still think it gives it a run for its

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690 
still think it gives it a run for its
money<00:01:55.470> doesn't<00:01:56.009> affect<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> damage<00:01:56.579> or

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
money doesn't affect the damage or

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.969 
money doesn't affect the damage or
accuracy<00:01:56.969> ops<00:01:57.390> fire<00:01:57.930> rate<00:01:58.110> by<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.500> ups<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
accuracy ops fire rate by one ups the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
accuracy ops fire rate by one ups the
handling<00:01:59.340> by<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.880> lowers<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> mobility

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
handling by two and lowers the mobility

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990 
handling by two and lowers the mobility
by<00:02:00.960> three<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.759> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
by three now I think the thing that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.539 
by three now I think the thing that
obviously<00:02:03.659> hurts<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.710> inferno<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.250> most

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
obviously hurts the the inferno the most

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.370 
obviously hurts the the inferno the most
is<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> fact<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.780> lowers<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
is the fact that it actually lowers the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.960 
is the fact that it actually lowers the
mobility<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> messes<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
mobility so I think it messes with the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.360 
mobility so I think it messes with the
80s<00:02:09.390> time<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.140> upping<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> fire<00:02:10.890> rate<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
80s time but upping the fire rate on the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.400 
80s time but upping the fire rate on the
RT<00:02:11.730> fast<00:02:12.000> shooting<00:02:12.270> Val<00:02:12.450> 27<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.080> abs

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
RT fast shooting Val 27 is abs

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
RT fast shooting Val 27 is abs
phenomenal<00:02:14.220> seeing<00:02:14.730> something<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> gun

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
phenomenal seeing something like a gun

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.720 
phenomenal seeing something like a gun
like<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.780> bad<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:17.040> faster<00:02:17.550> ever

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
like the bad one of the more faster ever

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.310 
like the bad one of the more faster ever
shooting<00:02:18.180> assault<00:02:18.450> rifles<00:02:18.780> we've<00:02:18.900> seen<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
shooting assault rifles we've seen in a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.260 
shooting assault rifles we've seen in a
call<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> duty<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.340> opting<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
call of duty and then opting it just a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.370 
call of duty and then opting it just a
little<00:02:21.300> bit<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.320> you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
little bit more because you know you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500 
little bit more because you know you
can't<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.740> rapid<00:02:23.070> fire<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.550> any<00:02:24.060> assault

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
can't but rapid fire on any assault

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840 
can't but rapid fire on any assault
rifle<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.900> put<00:02:25.050> them<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.230> SMGs<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
rifle you can put them on SMGs but and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
rifle you can put them on SMGs but and
you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.150> take<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.600> bow<00:02:27.720> 27<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you know you take the bow 27 in the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.430 
you know you take the bow 27 in the
inferno<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.580> put<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> plus<00:02:30.570> one<00:02:30.840> firing<00:02:31.140> on

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
inferno and you put a plus one firing on

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
inferno and you put a plus one firing on
it<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:31.800> makes<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.160> much<00:02:32.520> better<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it just makes it that much better and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.370 
it just makes it that much better and
then<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> handling<00:02:33.990> too<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
then you up the handling too so I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.080 
then you up the handling too so I
believe<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.890> bring<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.340> gun<00:02:35.550> up<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.790> little

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
believe you bring the gun up a little

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
believe you bring the gun up a little
bit<00:02:36.210> better<00:02:36.420> after<00:02:36.720> sprinting<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.800> can

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
bit better after sprinting so you can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.170 
bit better after sprinting so you can
get<00:02:38.010> those<00:02:38.100> bolts<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:38.790> bit<00:02:38.970> faster

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
get those bolts out a little bit faster

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
get those bolts out a little bit faster
plus<00:02:40.020> already<00:02:40.440> having<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.550> up

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
plus already having that up the up

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.160 
plus already having that up the up
firing<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.660> makes<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
firing on it it just makes it a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
firing on it it just makes it a
phenomenal<00:02:43.650> gun<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.100> damage<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.640> decent

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
phenomenal gun now the damage is decent

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.880 
phenomenal gun now the damage is decent
on<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.480> when<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.960> plus<00:02:46.440> 2<00:02:46.650> damage

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
on it but when you have a plus 2 damage

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.650 
on it but when you have a plus 2 damage
on<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> thing<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> obscene<00:02:48.030> Steve<00:02:48.420> does

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
on the thing like the obscene Steve does

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.780 
on the thing like the obscene Steve does
you<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.650> can't<00:02:49.890> compete<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.730> I'm
