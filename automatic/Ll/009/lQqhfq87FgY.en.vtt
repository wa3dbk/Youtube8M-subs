of<00:01:24.190> overwhelming<00:01:24.340> odds<00:01:24.910> I'm<00:01:25.210> left<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.570> only

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
of overwhelming odds I'm left with only

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.230 
of overwhelming odds I'm left with only
one<00:01:25.840> option<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:27.009> gonna<00:01:27.190> have<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.520> science<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
one option I'm gonna have to science the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.090 
one option I'm gonna have to science the
 out<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.840> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

okay<00:01:32.730> let's<00:01:33.330> do<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.600> math<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.080> gotta<00:01:34.500> figure

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
okay let's do the math I gotta figure

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
okay let's do the math I gotta figure
out<00:01:34.860> how<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.010> grow<00:01:35.160> four<00:01:35.520> years<00:01:35.790> worth<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> food

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
out how to grow four years worth of food

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.430 
out how to grow four years worth of food
here<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.230> a<00:01:37.590> planet<00:01:38.010> where<00:01:38.130> nothing<00:01:38.190> grows<00:01:39.440> but

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
here on a planet where nothing grows but

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.510 
here on a planet where nothing grows but
if<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> can't<00:01:40.860> figure<00:01:41.010> out<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.370> make

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
if I can't figure out a way to make

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.250 
if I can't figure out a way to make
contact<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.060> NASA<00:01:42.180> none<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.900> matters

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
contact with NASA none of this matters

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.730 
contact with NASA none of this matters
