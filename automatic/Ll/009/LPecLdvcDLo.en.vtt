want to do that and leave it in for
approximately<00:06:41.540> maybe<00:06:42.310> 3540<00:06:43.310> minutes<00:06:44.890> and

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
approximately maybe 3540 minutes and

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.130 
approximately maybe 3540 minutes and
then<00:06:46.070> your<00:06:46.220> keys<00:06:46.430> will<00:06:46.580> be<00:06:46.700> on<00:06:46.850> so<00:06:47.330> as<00:06:47.630> you<00:06:48.020> can

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
see we have one perfect Keech so it took

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.890 
see we have one perfect Keech so it took
about<00:06:51.470> and<00:06:52.220> I<00:06:52.730> think<00:06:52.820> it<00:06:53.060> was<00:06:53.150> about<00:06:53.240> 35

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
about and I think it was about 35

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.980 
about and I think it was about 35
minutes<00:06:54.260> and<00:06:55.090> my<00:06:56.090> recommendation<00:06:56.840> is<00:06:56.870> if

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
minutes and my recommendation is if

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.420 
minutes and my recommendation is if
you've<00:06:57.200> got<00:06:57.290> a<00:06:57.350> fan<00:06:57.560> assisted<00:06:57.770> oven<00:06:58.250> I

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
you've got a fan assisted oven I

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.480 
you've got a fan assisted oven I
probably<00:06:59.150> turn<00:06:59.450> it<00:06:59.630> down<00:06:59.930> just<00:07:00.440> after<00:07:01.160> maybe

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
probably turn it down just after maybe

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.670 
probably turn it down just after maybe
25<00:07:02.090> minutes<00:07:02.480> because<00:07:02.570> you<00:07:02.720> see<00:07:02.900> that<00:07:03.080> the<00:07:03.440> top

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
25 minutes because you see that the top

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.200 
25 minutes because you see that the top
is<00:07:03.710> a<00:07:03.890> little<00:07:03.920> bit<00:07:04.190> too<00:07:04.340> Brown<00:07:04.610> for<00:07:04.820> me<00:07:04.940> but

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
is a little bit too Brown for me but

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.060 
is a little bit too Brown for me but
apart<00:07:05.720> from<00:07:05.810> that<00:07:05.990> I<00:07:06.080> think<00:07:06.230> it<00:07:06.470> looks<00:07:06.620> fab<00:07:06.830> and

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
apart from that I think it looks fab and

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.200 
apart from that I think it looks fab and
we're<00:07:07.250> going<00:07:07.370> to<00:07:07.400> really<00:07:07.610> enjoy<00:07:07.670> eating<00:07:08.120> it
