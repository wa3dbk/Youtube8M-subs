whether you put it in there but it's got
completely<00:02:32.840> removable<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.470> says<00:02:33.740> it's<00:02:34.040> got

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
completely removable it says it's got

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
completely removable things on it so you

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.120 
completely removable things on it so you
can<00:02:39.590> actually<00:02:39.740> wash<00:02:40.280> them<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.860> I've<00:02:42.950> had

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
can actually wash them but so I've had

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.410 
can actually wash them but so I've had
that<00:02:43.280> one<00:02:43.430> nearly<00:02:43.670> two<00:02:43.820> years<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.180> I've<00:02:44.270> never

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
that one nearly two years and I've never

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
that one nearly two years and I've never
actually<00:02:44.660> washed<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.160> I'm<00:02:46.870> yeah<00:02:47.900> never<00:02:48.260> any

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
actually washed it so I'm yeah never any

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.610 
actually washed it so I'm yeah never any
turns<00:02:49.760> out<00:02:49.970> when<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.180> boys<00:02:50.390> got<00:02:50.810> marks<00:02:51.320> on<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
turns out when the boys got marks on it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.449 
turns out when the boys got marks on it
already

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
already

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.670 
already
so<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.630> they'll<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:53.990> polish<00:02:54.290> off<00:02:54.440> then

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
so I think they'll just polish off then

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040 
so I think they'll just polish off then
they're<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.120> marks<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.300> dirt<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.810> stuff

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
they're just marks and dirt and stuff

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.300 
they're just marks and dirt and stuff
but<00:02:57.860> um<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.959> will<00:03:00.230> show<00:03:00.440> every<00:03:00.950> single

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.790 
but um this will show every single
little<00:03:01.459> scratch<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.330> put<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.630> it

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
little scratch that you put on it

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.020 
little scratch that you put on it
whether<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:03.950> even<00:03:04.459> with<00:03:04.550> your<00:03:04.640> finger<00:03:04.940> now
