I think attraction spotting attraction
is<00:00:09.840> without<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> doubt<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.559> easiest<00:00:10.889> we're

very<00:00:12.179> emotional<00:00:12.840> creatures<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.590> we're

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
very emotional creatures and when we're

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.560 
very emotional creatures and when we're
attracted<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> somebody<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.880> very<00:00:15.299> very

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
attracted to somebody it's very very

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.510 
attracted to somebody it's very very
difficult<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.139> hide<00:00:16.320> people<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.310> they're

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
difficult to hide people think they're

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.090 
difficult to hide people think they're
hiding<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.029> things<00:00:18.480> always<00:00:18.690> slip<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.710> one

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
hiding it but things always slip so one

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500 
hiding it but things always slip so one
of<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> ways<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.640> slip<00:00:20.910> are<00:00:21.060> essentially

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
of the ways they slip are essentially

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.939 
of the ways they slip are essentially
the<00:00:21.600> eyes<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.109> there's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> lot<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.680> different

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the eyes and there's a lot of different

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
the eyes and there's a lot of different
ways<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.340> use<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> eyes<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.029> determine

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
ways you can use the eyes to determine

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.939 
ways you can use the eyes to determine
or<00:00:24.630> whether<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.080> somebody's<00:00:25.500> attracted

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
or whether or not somebody's attracted

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.720 
or whether or not somebody's attracted
you<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.830> thing<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> essentially<00:00:29.580> eye

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you the first thing is essentially eye

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.959 
you the first thing is essentially eye
contact<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.890> course<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
contact right so of course you for the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
contact right so of course you for the
most<00:00:33.210> part<00:00:33.540> usually<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.170> make<00:00:34.290> eye<00:00:34.500> contact

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
most part usually we make eye contact

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
most part usually we make eye contact
with<00:00:35.160> people<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.640> were<00:00:35.760> interested<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.270> or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
with people that were interested in or

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.049 
with people that were interested in or
people<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.840> were<00:00:36.960> attracted<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:38.059> but

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
people that were attracted to right but

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
people that were attracted to right but
this<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.390> entirely<00:00:39.960> true<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.620> people

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this is not entirely true some people

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.920 
this is not entirely true some people
are<00:00:41.040> shy<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.820> anxious<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.510> they're<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.780> going

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
are shy or anxious and they're not going

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.030 
are shy or anxious and they're not going
to<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.110> eye<00:00:43.200> contact<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.890> you're

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to make eye contact so what you're

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
to make eye contact so what you're
looking<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.579> essentially<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.690> deviation

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
looking for essentially is a deviation

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
looking for essentially is a deviation
in<00:00:46.680> eye<00:00:46.829> contact<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> ways<00:00:48.450> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
in eye contact so one of the ways you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.060 
in eye contact so one of the ways you
can<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.930> eye<00:00:49.050> contact<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.620> there's<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
can use is eye contact and there's a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
can use is eye contact and there's a
little<00:00:50.340> trick<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.480> reliable

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
little trick that's very very reliable

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.920 
little trick that's very very reliable
so<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.410> gonna<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.420> look

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
so what you're gonna do is if you look

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
so what you're gonna do is if you look
at<00:00:55.020> somebody<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> bar<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> restaurant<00:00:56.190> on

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
at somebody in a bar and a restaurant on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.900 
at somebody in a bar and a restaurant on
the<00:00:56.789> street<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.750> break<00:00:58.170> eye<00:00:58.469> contact

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
the street and they break eye contact

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.950 
the street and they break eye contact
vertically<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.840> make

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
vertically so they look down so you make

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.689 
vertically so they look down so you make
eye<00:01:01.079> contact<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.280> break<00:01:02.520> eye

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
eye contact with them and they break eye

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.820 
eye contact with them and they break eye
contact<00:01:02.730> vertically<00:01:03.600> vertically<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.650> right

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
contact vertically vertically all right

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
contact vertically vertically all right
and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.189> within<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.640> 30<00:01:06.299> seconds<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.020> like

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and then within like 30 seconds or like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.330 
and then within like 30 seconds or like
twenty<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> thirty<00:01:07.740> seconds<00:01:08.159> they

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
twenty to thirty seconds they

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
twenty to thirty seconds they
reestablished<00:01:09.240> eye<00:01:09.330> contact<00:01:09.930> approach<00:01:10.229> them

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
reestablished eye contact approach them

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
reestablished eye contact approach them
they<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.479> reliable

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they like you it's a very very reliable

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.300 
they like you it's a very very reliable
thing<00:01:13.200> essentially<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.619> they're<00:01:13.710> doing<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
thing essentially what they're doing you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
thing essentially what they're doing you
stare<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.150> submitting<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
stare at them they're submitting to you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
stare at them they're submitting to you
and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.580> second

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and then they they take a little second

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
and then they they take a little second
glance<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.330> who<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.110> very

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
glance to see who you are it's very very

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
glance to see who you are it's very very
very<00:01:19.710> reliable<00:01:20.280> another<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.720> somebody

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
very reliable another thing if somebody

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
very reliable another thing if somebody
so<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.130> opposite<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.150> if

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so in the opposite of that would be if

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.580 
so in the opposite of that would be if
you<00:01:24.299> look<00:01:24.479> at<00:01:24.630> somebody<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> they<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.500> at

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you look at somebody and they look at

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
you look at somebody and they look at
you<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:25.920> immediately<00:01:26.040> go<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.670> break

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you and they immediately go and break

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
you and they immediately go and break
eye<00:01:27.600> contact<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.740> interested

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
eye contact it's like up not interested

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
eye contact it's like up not interested
but<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.119> reliable<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.869> break

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
but what is reliable is that you break

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.660 
but what is reliable is that you break
eye<00:01:31.200> contact<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.890> come<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.100> break<00:01:32.549> eye

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
eye contact and then come back break eye

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.550 
eye contact and then come back break eye
contact<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:33.329> come<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.720> great<00:01:33.990> guy<00:01:34.110> contact

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
contact then come back great guy contact

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
contact then come back great guy contact

contact<00:01:40.799> becomes<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.850> awkward<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
contact becomes very very awkward one of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.210 
contact becomes very very awkward one of
the<00:01:42.899> things<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.649> classes<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the things I do in one of my classes is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
the things I do in one of my classes is
I<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.430> people<00:01:44.700> stare<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.090> stare<00:01:45.479> each<00:01:45.689> other

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I have people stare and stare each other

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.270 
I have people stare and stare each other
on<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> ice<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:46.560> minutes<00:01:46.770> without

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
on the ice for three minutes without

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.499 
on the ice for three minutes without
saying<00:01:47.670> anything<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.030> need<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> stare

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
saying anything they just need to stare

saying anything they just need to stare
each<00:01:48.570> other<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.840> there's<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.250> try

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
each other and there's like this try

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.920 
each other and there's like this try
that<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.579> out<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> try<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> stare<00:01:51.390> somebody<00:01:51.810> in

that go out and try to stare somebody in

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.280 
that go out and try to stare somebody in
the<00:01:52.020> eyes<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:53.850> 90<00:01:54.240> seconds<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.720> guarantee

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the eyes for even 90 seconds I guarantee

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
the eyes for even 90 seconds I guarantee
you<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.500> can't<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.219> awkward<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you you can't do it it's awkward and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520 
you you can't do it it's awkward and
it's<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.329> awkward<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.960> humans<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it's so awkward because humans are just

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's so awkward because humans are just
and<00:01:58.680> we're<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.670> level<00:01:59.909> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and we're not really it's a level of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
and we're not really it's a level of
intimacy<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> stare<00:02:01.049> somebody<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
intimacy when you stare somebody in the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
intimacy when you stare somebody in the
eyes<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> it's<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.340> awkward<00:02:02.520> doing<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
eyes and it's just so awkward doing it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.700 
eyes and it's just so awkward doing it
with<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.299> stranger<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.140> know<00:02:04.170> studies<00:02:04.560> will

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
with this stranger you know studies will

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.929 
with this stranger you know studies will
show<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.219> stare<00:02:05.430> somebody<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
show that if you stare somebody in the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.059 
show that if you stare somebody in the
eyes<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.090> 90<00:02:06.570> seconds<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> emit<00:02:07.350> 90<00:02:07.740> seconds

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
eyes for 90 seconds to emit 90 seconds

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
eyes for 90 seconds to emit 90 seconds
to<00:02:08.129> 3<00:02:08.879> minutes<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> sudden<00:02:09.869> you're

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to 3 minutes all of a sudden you're

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.420 
to 3 minutes all of a sudden you're
gonna<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.500> person<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> lot<00:02:11.039> better<00:02:11.280> than

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
gonna like that person a lot better than

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.590 
gonna like that person a lot better than
everybody<00:02:11.610> else<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> room<00:02:12.209> because

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
everybody else in the room because

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.820 
everybody else in the room because
kind<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.840> shared<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.230> emotional<00:02:13.800> connection

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
kind of shared this emotional connection

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.670 
kind of shared this emotional connection
so<00:02:14.790> eye<00:02:14.820> contacts<00:02:15.540> important<00:02:15.960> in<00:02:16.170> that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so eye contacts important in that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.470 
so eye contacts important in that
respect<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.640> second<00:02:18.000> thing<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.210> can<00:02:18.240> look

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
respect the second thing you can look

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.220 
respect the second thing you can look
for<00:02:19.070> essentially<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.820> blink<00:02:21.210> rate<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:21.840> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
for essentially this blink rate now this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.810 
for essentially this blink rate now this
is<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> little<00:02:22.830> bit<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.490> cool<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
is a little bit this is really cool so

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820 
is a little bit this is really cool so
blink<00:02:24.420> rates<00:02:24.660> correlated<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.350> emotional

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
blink rates correlated with emotional

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.350 
blink rates correlated with emotional
excitement<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:26.820> emotionally

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
excitement so when we're emotionally

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.090 
excitement so when we're emotionally
excited<00:02:27.690> our<00:02:28.020> blink<00:02:28.350> rate<00:02:28.530> tends<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.950> increase

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
excited our blink rate tends to increase

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.160 
excited our blink rate tends to increase
right<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.730> average<00:02:30.060> average<00:02:30.720> blink<00:02:30.990> rates

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
right so average average blink rates

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
right so average average blink rates
tend<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.530> be<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.740> below<00:02:32.220> twenty<00:02:32.610> blinks<00:02:32.910> per

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
tend to be a below twenty blinks per

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.420 
tend to be a below twenty blinks per
minute<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.480> most<00:02:33.930> people<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.860> depends<00:02:35.280> on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
minute so most people it depends on

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370 
minute so most people it depends on
where<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:35.910> but<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:36.810> hard<00:02:37.110> to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
where you are but it's really hard to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.870 
where you are but it's really hard to
literally<00:02:37.590> nail<00:02:37.860> down<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.460> average

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
literally nail down with the average

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.850 
literally nail down with the average
blink<00:02:39.210> rate<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.110> my<00:02:40.230> experience<00:02:40.740> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
blink rate is but in my experience it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.590 
blink rate is but in my experience it
seems<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.310> around<00:02:41.580> ten<00:02:41.820> blinks<00:02:42.180> per<00:02:42.240> minute

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
seems to be around ten blinks per minute

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.010 
seems to be around ten blinks per minute
right

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
right

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140 
right
so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.800> whenever<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> see<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.520> sudden

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
so you see whenever you see a sudden

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.330 
so you see whenever you see a sudden
spike<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> bunch<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.410> sudden<00:02:46.710> spikes<00:02:47.070> in

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
spike or a bunch of sudden spikes in

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.740 
spike or a bunch of sudden spikes in
somebody's<00:02:47.850> blink<00:02:48.120> rate<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.660> an

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
somebody's blink rate it can be an

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.990 
somebody's blink rate it can be an
indication<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.260> attraction<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.520> my<00:02:50.670> dating

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
indication of attraction so in my dating

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610 
indication of attraction so in my dating
studies<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.630> see<00:02:51.660> blink<00:02:52.200> rates<00:02:52.410> through<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
studies you see blink rates through the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.230 
studies you see blink rates through the
roof<00:02:52.800> because<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> person's<00:02:53.580> across<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
roof because the person's across the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.520 
roof because the person's across the
table<00:02:54.420> from<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.690> years<00:02:54.930> an<00:02:55.080> emotional
