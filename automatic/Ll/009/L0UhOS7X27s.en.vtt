00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.179 
basically the dials you turn the body
the<00:01:35.790> dials<00:01:36.150> change<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.560> paddles<00:01:38.040> up

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the dials change and these paddles up

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
the dials change and these paddles up
here<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.450> knocking<00:01:39.689> against<00:01:40.229> each

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
here will be like knocking against each

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.450 
here will be like knocking against each
other<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.070> block<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> Perry<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:43.460> push

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
other to like a block and Perry or push

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
other to like a block and Perry or push
back<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.869> guess<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.470> could<00:01:46.530> use<00:01:46.740> your

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
back so I guess you could use your

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
back so I guess you could use your
imagination<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> imagine<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.270> something

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
imagination to imagine this is something

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.789 
imagination to imagine this is something
more<00:01:48.720> than<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.680> just

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
more than it is but really it's just

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.230 
more than it is but really it's just
another<00:01:50.130> form<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> rock<00:01:50.640> paper<00:01:50.850> scissor
