00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.800
 of course it is that suarez 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.790
 you are found 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.130
 but for now silooy contreras are so listeners 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.669
 from a distance you won't love love it 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.560
 of course it is judgment and that is quite a chance 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.790
 that the z 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.400
 they were themselves too 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.690
 donner has 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.380
 the slight injuries have been sustained 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 from a free kick and that's how it is 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.139
 both and here that determines some of the pill 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.139
 what do I do now I do not understand 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 the challenge 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.870
 is celtic 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.360
 stekelenburg 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 he has not caught the ball completely 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 so not last 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.400
 property finance 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.400
 This robbery became the first pole again 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 now it is now 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 heeringa de portuguese 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.870
 four a free kick was already dangerous hostel that now shot at the first post 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.670
 Brussels is true 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.560
 doesn't even come close 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.560
 moreover, hunts 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.820
 that is a hard core for ajax 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.910
 because there is further year further 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 crowe stekelenburg 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.969
 he prevents stronghold 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.249
 is in pain 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.349
 but useful pain 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 by not fitting this party 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.110
 the crisis 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.529
 rest signal 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.269
 unexplained euros 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.269
 half still have ajax 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.319
 avoid switching the new vehicle into the champions league preliminary round 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.949
 suarez is missing a little too late 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
 lucy lawless 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.979
 it is quiet in the polman stadium 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 a few fans of ajax name 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.589
 which I have to win here 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.699
 very handy of course 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 hit a shelling 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.779
 shortly after the break a huge boost for ajax 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.259
 a blow to the other side 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.239
 we search for suarez again he runs away at kilos 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.719
 suarez 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.140
 it goes it is now 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.140
 this is too crazy for ajax 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.689
 in no time 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.529
 the game upside down 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.129
 but again it actually comes from solaris that again becomes a whole 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.940
 many chose this name to write the longest runs 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.539
 the police reported that 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.329
 von trier is sitting 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.509
 completely overlooks the young's presence 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:02.999
 emanuelson 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.419
 you can be 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.729
 lost 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.659
 just don't know anymore 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.529
 it could just happen that if ajax continues 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.840
 of course not 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.420
 river is closed 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.039
 it is therefore 10 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.669
 over and out of ajax 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.910
 the go to the playoffs for the chip is that i can't miss it anymore 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.980
 it happened in nine minutes he was already close to the present twice 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.150
 a blunder from the goalkeeper 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.159
 Chris something 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.699
 a better 5 and 9 may get a lot done for each other again 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.259
 to be 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.370
 there is 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.990
 3 2 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.990
 And so happened everything will be technology 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.189
 Now the recovery providers are just like the young 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 at the first pole with a foot everyone has to get off 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.789
 so saying again a little hope 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.689
 two pounds 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.409
 so nobody anything 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.409
 how sea 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.370
 sophie has been grabbed by america 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.930
 advantage given by referee do he said anika penalty kick 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.839
 north korea 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.839
 Toppie done 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.669
 the yellow cards 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
 the penalty is justified 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.240
 platini ribizz 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.080
 that bike and shit on but asphalt 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.409
 stekelenburg 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.219
 reproduce 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.849
 they succeeded 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.849
 exciting toots with all the final phase being provisional 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.839
 Maarten Stekelenburg 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.449
 then she runs the idea is on the verge of offside and does stays 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.759
 brought down every time stop technique is a perspective 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.960
 that team is participating 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.129
 because on that anita lingers 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.580
 got away a few times well 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.689
 mainly 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.689
 that's what Stekelenburg said 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.330
 first in four 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
 the Stekelenburg 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.349
 the extra time 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.349
 still exciting 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.569
 typish 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.569
 so now also does not extend salpigidis 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.819
 it all looks thriller 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:11.189
 this must be at the last minute 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:17.629
 and trust is this dell has the final signal in ajax out 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 Volta in a strange way 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.939
 the Amsterdammers don't care at all 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:27.240
 it is already one 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.740
 encouraging how often the figure of gig 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.649
 he is late 

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:33.619
 4 4 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.069
 the soccer stadium 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:36.029
 westernlo division
