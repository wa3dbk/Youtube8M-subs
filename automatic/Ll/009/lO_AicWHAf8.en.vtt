the summer update and it's actually a
pretty<00:00:08.940> good<00:00:09.480> gun<00:00:09.809> I'd<00:00:10.019> say<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.769> be

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
even one of the best primaries it does a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.290 
even one of the best primaries it does a
lot<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> damage<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.130> especially<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.180> people

lot of damage and especially to people
in<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> armor<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> lot<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
in the armor it's going to do a lot of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
in the armor it's going to do a lot of
damage<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:23.220> quickly<00:00:23.519> although<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> bulk<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
damage very quickly although the bulk of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870 
damage very quickly although the bulk of
it<00:00:24.900> does<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.590> annoy<00:00:26.189> me<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.670> really

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it does kind of annoy me it's really

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
it does kind of annoy me it's really
hard<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
hard to see and it's a lot like the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
hard to see and it's a lot like the
water<00:00:29.130> rifle<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.670> which<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.150> about<00:00:30.300> are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
water rifle to which I like about are

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
water rifle to which I like about are
the<00:00:30.660> water<00:00:30.840> pistol<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.260> mean<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.740> water<00:00:31.890> pistol

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the water pistol i mean the water pistol

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.560 
the water pistol i mean the water pistol
might<00:00:32.399> even<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.790> better<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.270> just

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
might even be better than this just

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.910 
might even be better than this just
because<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.020> fact<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.559> has<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> lot

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
because of the fact that it has a lot

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
because of the fact that it has a lot
more<00:00:34.950> mobility<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.270> thing's<00:00:36.480> mobility

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
more mobility but this thing's mobility

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
more mobility but this thing's mobility
is<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.170> great<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> weird<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
is not great also it's kind of weird the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
is not great also it's kind of weird the
thing<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> reload<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.660> does<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:40.020> look

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
thing you reload it with does not look

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
thing you reload it with does not look
normal<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> rear<00:00:42.300> owed<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
normal and and in the rear owed the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
normal and and in the rear owed the
reload<00:00:43.559> animation<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.730> Cuddy

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
reload animation was kind of like Cuddy

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
reload animation was kind of like Cuddy
even<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.570> even<00:00:46.050> without<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> recording<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
even on even without the recording it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
even on even without the recording it
was<00:00:47.550> kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> annoying<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.420> okay<00:00:48.690> um

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
was kind of annoying but that's okay um

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
was kind of annoying but that's okay um
yeah<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> can't<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.610> what's<00:00:50.820> inside

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.440 
me he's good but yeah this thing has
splash<00:01:20.130> damage<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
splash damage as you can see kind of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
splash damage as you can see kind of
makes<00:01:21.600> sense<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> water<00:01:22.560> gun<00:01:22.770> splash

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
makes sense it's like a water gun splash

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.420 
makes sense it's like a water gun splash
water<00:01:23.580> around<00:01:24.140> puns<00:01:25.140> yeah<00:01:25.680> definitely<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.189> good

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
water around puns yeah definitely a good

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.649 
water around puns yeah definitely a good
gun<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.850> definitely<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.390> gonna<00:01:27.450> want

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
primaries that much I'm mostly into the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.920

prototype and the anti gravity gun both

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.980
