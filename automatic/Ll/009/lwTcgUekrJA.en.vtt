00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.119
 Hi all, and welcome to 7 objects, number 6. And today, this object is the exoskeleton! 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.619
 In 1942, in the American news 'Waldo' written by the very visionary Robert Anson Heinlein, 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.820
 we are presented with the arrogant Waldo Farthingwaite-Jones, suffering from myasthenia 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.060
 a severe neurological disorder characterized by heavy muscle weakness, which immobilizes 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.360
 his members. But Waldo posing as a little genius, develops a mechanical device, 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.910
 connected to him by a glove and a harness, which allows him to reproduce the desired movements. 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.820
 Moreover the scientific apparatus allowing to carry out manipulations under cover 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.840
 mechanical arms are now called waldoes in reference to this news. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.380
 But it's 20 years later, in 1963, that comes straight from the imagination 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.680
 of Stan Lee the armor of Iron Man. She truly democratized the vision 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.570
 Exoskeletons we make today. Because if Tony Stark does not have any super 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.520
 unlike his companions Thor, Hulk, or Captain America, he can not 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 remains no less a true genius for everything related to science and its 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 technological applications. His impressive skills allow him to design 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.860
 an armor, accompanying the least of its movements thus making it overpowering. 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 And it is in 2013 that the US military, under cover of the TALOS project, announced its 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 willingness to make his own exoskeletons for his soldiers. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.760
 In the form of light armor, the prototypes presented allow to increase 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.240
 physical strength, offer anti-projectile protection and monitor, thanks to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.340
 sensors, the vital data of the wearer. Still in test phase at the moment, 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.250
 the first armor should be operational in 2018. Even if we are far from 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.900
 the powerful armor of Iron Man, let's admit it's a great bet 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.950
 in application of a science fiction concept! 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.439
 And this implementation is just as formidable as the medical research was 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.350
 she also leans on the case of exoskeletons. 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.700
 For some years, some devices have been designed to make mobility 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 to severely disabled people. This is the case, for example, with the exoskeleton 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.840
 Re-Walk, marketed this summer, which allowed paraplegics to walk again. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.640
 And this process is neither more nor less than what Heinlein invented with Waldo 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.010
 70 years ago ... 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 I tell you tomorrow, for one last object, but in the meantime, do not forget: 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.010
 culture is like jam, adding butter is even better!
