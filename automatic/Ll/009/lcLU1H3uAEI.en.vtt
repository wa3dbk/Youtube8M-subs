Cece fortune at the CNC crash failures

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
Cece fortune at the CNC crash failures
because<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.960> does<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.410> does<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.920> move

what have a drop okay for the drop so
exciting<00:00:50.039> well<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.309> bolt<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
exciting well this bolt is gonna be so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
exciting well this bolt is gonna be so
good<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.020> gonna<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.530> precisely<00:00:53.010> milled

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
good it's gonna be so precisely milled

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.020 
good it's gonna be so precisely milled
out<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.289> it's<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.829> broken<00:00:56.460> no

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
out and it's not gonna be broken no

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
surfaces like that is if you run your

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.190 
surfaces like that is if you run your
nail<00:03:00.220> along<00:03:00.549> them<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.819> get<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.970> slight<00:03:01.540> sort<00:03:02.080> of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
nail along them you get a slight sort of

like<00:03:02.380> what<00:03:04.319> like<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.010> throw<00:03:06.730> lever<00:03:07.000> on

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
like what like the the throw lever on

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:30.539 
like what like the the throw lever on
the<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.680> video<00:03:09.010> board<00:03:09.220> has<00:03:09.519> been<00:03:09.700> cnc'd<00:03:29.549> so

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the on the video board has been cnc'd so

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.580 
the on the video board has been cnc'd so
is<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:30.880> whole<00:03:31.060> playlist<00:03:31.329> it's<00:03:32.290> probably

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
is this whole playlist it's probably

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.530 
is this whole playlist it's probably
just<00:03:32.739> like<00:03:32.890> CNC<00:03:33.340> crash<00:03:33.609> yeah<00:03:33.940> soon<00:03:34.359> as<00:03:34.390> he

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
just like CNC crash yeah soon as he

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.720 
just like CNC crash yeah soon as he
crashes<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.170> think<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.130> actually<00:03:36.220> labeled

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
crashes I think it's actually labeled

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.460 
crashes I think it's actually labeled
CNC<00:03:37.329> crash<00:03:37.630> porn<00:03:37.989> that's<00:03:38.650> really<00:03:38.950> funny<00:03:40.170> yeah

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
they would make a doorknob like this CVT

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.969 
they would make a doorknob like this CVT
what<00:05:01.050> continuously<00:05:02.050> variable<00:05:02.380> transmission

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979
