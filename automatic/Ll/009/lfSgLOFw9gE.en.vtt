00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.710 
looks pretty damn cool so for size
comparison<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.359> do<00:03:36.680> here's<00:03:37.680> little<00:03:38.010> Mac

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
comparison we can do here's little Mac

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.900 
comparison we can do here's little Mac
so<00:03:39.720> he's<00:03:39.870> quite<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> bit<00:03:40.440> bigger<00:03:40.620> than<00:03:40.910> Little

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
so he's quite a bit bigger than Little

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.670 
so he's quite a bit bigger than Little
Mac<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.299> course<00:03:42.480> little<00:03:42.900> Mac<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.199> little

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
Mac but of course little Mac is little

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.309 
Mac but of course little Mac is little
hence<00:03:43.889> his<00:03:44.040> name<00:03:44.220> little<00:03:44.639> Mac<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.359> we<00:03:46.260> got

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
hence his name little Mac and we got

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.649 
hence his name little Mac and we got
