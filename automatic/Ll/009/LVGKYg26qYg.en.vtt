00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.349
 Well, here we are on the alfa 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.950
 heroes of the storm so the next 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.639
 moba of blizzard so here we are on the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.410
 main page 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.509
 so we make a little smaller rat 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.790
 fast turn of the game modes so a 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.500
 workout you play alone with nine 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.109
 other characters controlled by 10 at the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.810
 cooperation where we play five players 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.490
 against 5 boots against the outcasts and 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.830
 then we play five to five 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.660
 there we are in the shop in the 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.720
 shop to all the heroes available there 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.070
 there is a small free package with the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.510
 game in any case in the alpha the others 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 are to buy against gold coins or 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.760
 against hard and stumbling dollars 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.719
 we can also customize and more 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.090
 exactly to buy books 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.500
 punishes for the heroes in the case 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 of dida do not see may be varied 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.489
 colors of his armor 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.469
 there it still costs 8 euros 99 when 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 even the joke so that's not it 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 not a small amount 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.460
 so we come back to the surface 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.310
 primary 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 so there is a stream of tak killed then in 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.149
 charge two groups simplify you have 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 just check one box and hop 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.330
 in the movie you appear your others 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 players as being in search of 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.770
 group the players can invite you 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.799
 if they are interested in your profile 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.820
 there we were invited typically so 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.950
 sent you have the list of all 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.770
 available characters what appears 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.570
 without a grid are those who did not 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.720
 there just to see you all the others 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.330
 players selected by your teammates 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.020
 the game starts and you are propelled 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.179
 in the nexus 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.289
 so here we are on the map it's called 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.140
 the black heart beast 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.090
 so so it's a pretty map 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.319
 funny since the main event 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.880
 is a pirate ship 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.920
 a pirate and whose captain actually 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.209
 is very fond of gold coins he is going 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.090
 must bring him gold coins 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.890
 to launch cannon bursts on the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.060
 adversary base then to get these 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.880
 Pleasures it's pretty simple actually 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.459
 just kill monsters that are a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.679
 little scattered on the map while 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.119
 trying to not get you killed by the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.979
 opponents whose klaus is in the base 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.959
 as before everything moba a small phase 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.040
 of preparation where you have to wait 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.530
 a few seconds before the doors 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.629
 of the bass opens and so that's it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.069
 really in a moba configuration 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.870
 standard that you have some basics 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.760
 diametrically opposed geographically 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.040
 opposite payzac you lie you have three 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 voice from north one to south and then our 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.670
 centers here you have to go with 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.800
 with your teammates for eventually 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 get to defeat the fastest 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.930
 is possible towards recreating 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.970
 ambushes happened too and especially to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.830
 save experience to your team 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.950
 since 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.950
 unlike the low word type of ottawa 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.690
 choay we lol actually experience it in 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.140
 heroes of the storm is common to all 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.060
 team 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.190
 history of not having an imbalance 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.570
 between characters that could be 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.020
 for example level 9 and then our 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.780
 again 10-12 because they farmed 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.040
 monsters like pigs so the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.370
 libya asks to believe that there is a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.480
 chest that appeared we know it's 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.510
 a little cheap to recover coins 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.120
 of gold the famous closer the captain of the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.820
 pirate ship that can kindly go 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 pound the base of our enemies with his 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.540
 cannons then of course that's a 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.890
 event that brings you coins 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 of gold if you take part in it and then 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.010
 and that also allows you to return the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.750
 course of the game if you ever are 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.370
 in bad shape 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.410
 the fighting is really going on like 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.330
 classic moba must move must 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.060
 to pay a little attention where 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.870
 find the opponents the units 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.850
 controlled by the ia are beasts to eat 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.490
 hay are beating on which 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.090
 see here's finally the weird over here at 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.070
 on the other hand invented the debate 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.660
 we said it previously actually there 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.310
 where oddly pays a little bit of 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.930
 standards is that the experience gained 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.320
 during when you kill groups 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.940
 units 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.340
 it's all your team if we take advantage 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.280
 not only after a while 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.870
 sure you pass the levels so like 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.459
 we'll see him there in a while 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.090
 a few seconds above your 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.860
 portrait does not belong like a 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.269
 an indication you need to choose a 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.319
 talent so that's not all 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.720
 levels but it's done to some 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.370
 levels and it will guide your way of 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.540
 play your hero or rather than have 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.790
 equipment purchased at a party or 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.000
 choose good powers there part 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.710
 is finished 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 our heart exploded we got 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.270
 beat by the opponent the parties 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.090
 last on average between 10 and 20 minutes 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.070
 big max is really big maximum that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.580
 go relatively fast when we're going 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.760
 is finished 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.960
 you come out of the game interface 34 21 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.390
 face the game you win from 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.860
 experience as a player but 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.370
 your character also wins in order to 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.960
 unlock abilities later 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.000
 that's about all we 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.690
 could you tell about this alfa 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.690
 heroes of the storm
