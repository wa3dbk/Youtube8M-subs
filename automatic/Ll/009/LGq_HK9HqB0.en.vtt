00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.209 
look like you know like it's the pip-boy
it's<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.500> work<00:01:09.649> like<00:01:09.829> the<00:01:09.950> people<00:01:10.159> I

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
it's going to work like the people I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.740 
it's going to work like the people I
actually<00:01:10.340> think<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.909> going<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.420> be<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
actually think it is going to be the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.840 
actually think it is going to be the
pip-boy<00:01:11.960> like<00:01:12.829> you<00:01:12.950> can<00:01:13.100> actually<00:01:13.369> make<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:13.729> a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
pip-boy like you can actually make it a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.520 
pip-boy like you can actually make it a
second<00:01:14.240> screen<00:01:14.390> experience<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:15.110> think<00:01:15.290> he<00:01:15.350> said

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
second screen experience I think he said

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.249 
second screen experience I think he said
within<00:01:16.460> game<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.240> can<00:01:17.450> actually<00:01:17.630> like<00:01:17.960> use

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
within game so you can actually like use

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.760 
within game so you can actually like use
your<00:01:18.530> pip-boy<00:01:19.149> on<00:01:20.149> your<00:01:20.570> arm<00:01:20.780> while<00:01:21.439> playing

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
your pip-boy on your arm while playing

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.649 
your pip-boy on your arm while playing
the<00:01:21.979> game<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:22.250> have<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:22.729> affect<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> game<00:01:23.390> I

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
the game and have it affect the game I

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.880 
the game and have it affect the game I
think<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.200> don't<00:01:24.439> know<00:01:24.530> if<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:24.710> going<00:01:24.799> to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
think I don't know if it's going to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.740 
think I don't know if it's going to
affect<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.460> game<00:01:25.610> per<00:01:25.789> se<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.240> think

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
affect the game per se but I think

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.889 
affect the game per se but I think
that's<00:01:26.899> what<00:01:27.020> he<00:01:27.079> was<00:01:27.140> talking<00:01:27.500> about<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.780> yeah

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
that's what he was talking about so yeah

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.560 
that's what he was talking about so yeah
so<00:01:30.110> that's<00:01:30.259> really<00:01:30.619> pretty<00:01:30.920> pretty<00:01:31.520> cool<00:01:31.789> from

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
so that's really pretty pretty cool from

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.679 
so that's really pretty pretty cool from
a<00:01:32.659> collector's<00:01:32.810> standpoint<00:01:33.380> it's<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.689> for

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
a collector's standpoint it's it's for

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:36.760 
a collector's standpoint it's it's for
me<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.020> would<00:01:36.109> be<00:01:36.259> something<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.649> would

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
me it would be something that would

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.920 
me it would be something that would
probably<00:01:37.039> probably<00:01:37.880> still<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.390> kind<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.689> sit

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
probably probably still just kind of sit

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.830 
probably probably still just kind of sit
up<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.170> my<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.619> my<00:01:39.649> Bureau<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.460> opened<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:40.909> not

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
up on my on my Bureau if I opened it not

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.690 
up on my on my Bureau if I opened it not
something<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.320> would<00:01:42.619> actually<00:01:42.859> probably<00:01:43.310> wear

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
something I would actually probably wear

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.120 
something I would actually probably wear
and<00:01:44.119> use<00:01:44.380> but<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.409> lot<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.590> people<00:01:45.829> are<00:01:45.920> going<00:01:46.039> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
and use but a lot of people are going to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.709 
and use but a lot of people are going to
really<00:01:46.250> love<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.549> feature<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.329> that's<00:01:47.479> cool

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719
