00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.180
 This video tutorial is dedicated to 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.610
 proper operation and solution 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.369
 possible battery problems with your 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.220
 in her we will tell you how 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.939
 use a laptop to zoom 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.739
 battery life 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.410
 analyze the key rules of operation 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.730
 so that the battery serves you as much as possible 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.280
 let's talk for a long time about 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.010
 common problems such as 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.350
 reduced operating time or incomplete 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.699
 battery charging in most cases 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.239
 it's easy to fix 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:52.309
 self laptop time from 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.730
 battery directly depends on those 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.489
 tasks 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.309
 which you load it the more 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.359
 Vayu nodes work the faster falls 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.429
 energy reserve 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.460
 The main consumers of power are 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.150
 video card processor and of course the backlight 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.909
 screen 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.580
 let's start with the highlight you are surprised but only 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.310
 two three grayscale divisions can 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.680
 delay charging thirty minutes 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.050
 even for an hour depending on the model 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.880
 hold down to decrease brightness 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.280
 fn function key 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.190
 in the bottom left of the keyboard and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.530
 repeatedly press f5 on the screen 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.810
 the corresponding indicator will be highlighted 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.930
 to return the brightness to a higher 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.930
 level hold fn and press f6 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.910
 as for the video card , everything is here 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.390
 just spend the most energy 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.460
 games 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.710
 shoot virtual enemies or 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.050
 conquer race tracks better 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.270
 near the outlet watching movies 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.430
 spends less than games but also 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.710
 noticeably reduces the running time from 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.810
 batteries you can configure your computer to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.490
 increased energy saving by choosing 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 proper nutritional plan 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.050
 click on the battery icon in the right 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.210
 bottom corner of the desktop 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.670
 in the window that opens, select one of 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.739
 preset modes either push 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.080
 advanced power options 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.269
 where we can adjust the parameters 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.790
 power management of the main nodes 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.940
 computer on some woyo models 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.040
 There is an integrated mode switch 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.260
 power supplies and you can choose 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.110
 stamina saves energy by reducing 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.710
 performance sleeps faster 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.060
 but spends the battery or auto that is 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.370
 balanced also recommend 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.800
 close application running background te 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.230
 which you do not use in this 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.440
 the moment they load the RAM 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.070
 which also requires power in moments 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.500
 idle time 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.060
 close the lid go to sleep 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.580
 or hibernation 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 while the computer is waiting for you 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.480
 actively consumes battery 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.570
 if you stopped using for a while 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.400
 Internet disconnect from wifi networks 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.790
 3g or lte and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.600
 using the switch on the case or 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.100
 turning on 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.800
 airplane mode disable her beat device 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.390
 especially external hard drives and 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.390
 optical drives 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.580
 even a mouse spends a precious charge if 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.770
 your antivirus checks the system 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.650
 then keep in mind that at this moment he 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.170
 makes the processor and drives work 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.739
 more active in operation mode from 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.720
 batteries 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.130
 it can greatly reduce the time 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.340
 battery life 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.220
 finally there are simple laws of physics cold 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.709
 reduces battery life 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.709
 and your woyo's battery is no exception 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.900
 never store your battery 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.330
 laptop in discharged condition 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.120
 This is a universal tip that will help. 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.480
 extend the life of any lithium ion 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.890
 battery the other extreme is 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.590
 constant recharge when laptop 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.750
 connected to power and battery all 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.489
 time maintained at 100 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.100
 percentage charge level 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.709
 Avoid this practice and quantity 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.180
 charge-discharge cycles will increase in 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.890
 times 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.500
 disconnect from the network when the battery is charged 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.630
 comes up to 100 percent or take out a 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.390
 to b when working with connected 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.940
 Adapter is, however, and a compromise 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.549
 battery care mode option 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.470
 The physics of the process is such that 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.050
 battery life only beats 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.860
 maintaining the maximum charge level 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.259
 limit filling 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.169
 youth or eighty percent and 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.689
 can safely work on the network 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.669
 as you already understood vayu possesses such 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.639
 special mode features 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.860
 battery care click assist 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.259
 with laptops turned on in the opened 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.080
 worker in the right pane 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.389
 Select the icon with this speedometer 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.120
 performance button then in 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.939
 the list that appears we go down to the section 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.280
 battery care function push 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.919
 change settings and then on 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.770
 care mode switch you can 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.590
 choose two levels of protection with maximum 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.889
 50 percent charge limit or 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.500
 average charge 80 percent after 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.189
 enable mode is necessary 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.229
 to restart a computer 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.689
 however, you need to consider that with 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.120
 over time any battery is slow 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.699
 losing its original capacity this 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.710
 normal property of any lithium ion 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.449
 battery current wear your 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.919
 battery 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.120
 automatically evaluated in the mode menu 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.120
 battery care 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.130
 first common laptop problem 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.550
 not charging fully stopping 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.710
 at 50 or 80 percent this 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.320
 connected not with the properties of a b b a c 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.900
 battery care settings 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.580
 if you want to turn it off do 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.770
 following operations 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.180
 press the assist button on the case 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.610
 included laptop 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.210
 then go to section 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.240
 performance in the opened 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.060
 the warriors program go down to point 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.420
 battery care function click 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.260
 change settings and click on 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.420
 switch function after reboot 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.340
 battery can charge one hundred 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.140
 percent 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.930
 the second problem looks like this after 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.480
 full battery discharge you connect 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.750
 power supply however charge remains 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.510
 at 0 percent discharge the battery 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.970
 completely extremely undesirable however 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.430
 if it already happened connect 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.520
 computer to the network and leave the laptop on 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.710
 several hours usually at night while 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.190
 battery charging indicator on the case 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.290
 may catch fire immediately if described 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.960
 the procedure did not help what does 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.180
 it's time to get a new battery 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.790
 maybe even consider the option 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.560
 high capacity acquisitions 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.970
 which can extend the term 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.170
 battery life woyo 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.170
 twice
