00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.000
 today we are going to make a recipe a lot 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.679
 very simple we start from these spigo 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 read you see are the classic spi 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.350
 schooners that you buy say are the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 classic sea ​​bass per portion these 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.070
 were frozen we have averted 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.320
 so surely it will have happened to you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 even to you more than once than maybe 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.369
 buy them because they cost little because 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.279
 wanted 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.890
 normally when I use 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 bass or fish, however, with plays 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 I then thaw it to cook it with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 rather strong flavors in this 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.770
 case here and let's go with curry 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.700
 of the oil and oven age I go 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700
 directly the oven 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.820
 oven that I put at the maximum of 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.000
 temperature 250 degrees of salt 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.629
 I admit that on the cutting board white pepper and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.850
 put a couple of spoons and do it 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:12.100
 same with the curry a couple of spoons 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:16.299
 of carrie so then we go to practice 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.780
 two transverse incisions so up to 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:24.210
 that you don't touch the central spine like that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.210
 and we repeat also from the opposite side 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.909
 at this point we take the fish is like 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.229
 if I had to send it to the stranded areas then 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.159
 let's try to make the most 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.520
 possible the mixture of carrie salt e 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.520
 pepper 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 no we also pour a little inside 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.299
 at this point it's time to go to 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.429
 bake then we go to take the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.489
 our oven pan with the oil that 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:02:02.800
 it will have become nice and we go there 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:05.519
 to put our schooners and spies 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.519
 let's go back to the oven 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.470
 consider the temperature at 250 degrees 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.170
 that is, the maximum you can afford 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.480
 my oven we are going to prepare the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.580
 side dish a very simple salad 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:34.390
 green with some tomatoes we talk 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:37.060
 in meta I would say that these for one 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.299
 just enough portion I have 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.519
 we put some mixed salad 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.840
 together of course for started 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.580
 used is the one you like best 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.080
 and mix a little and don't go with it 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.410
 right away the moment I got it right at the last 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.299
 moment just before serving 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.530
 because I put ours first 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.599
 cut in the oven with a little bit 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.640
 of oil because they are so small 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.709
 bass this immediately allows me to 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.370
 then make a region the crust 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.410
 don't open that effect let's say type 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 when it is boiled it is softer it 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.829
 but you can do this here normally 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.600
 when you still have pieces 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.880
 rather small and therefore with some 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.510
 rather rapid cooking has passed 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.920
 five minutes 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.549
 at this point it is worth lowering the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.130
 temperature the maximum flow rate 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.630
 180 degree temperature 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.280
 why give the maximum at temperature 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.160
 this will allow you to lift 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.609
 immediately the skin and create a 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.340
 sort of space to maintain anyway 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.680
 always the meat of the wet sea bass are 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.069
 spi schooners that are under 3 pounds 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.069
 consider another 7 8 minutes of cooking 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.300
 see you can check then the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.610
 cooking by the lateral incisions 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.250
 you see that it is practically practically 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.700
 cooked if you want you can take a bit of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:10.459
 ryegrass that remained at the bottom e 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.319
 pour it a little over so just for 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.680
 actually to give a bit of shine 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:20.690
 at the plate nothing more trying not to 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:26.440
 break our bass go to 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:30.520
 positioning is a fool in so-called 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.740
 and let's season some salad 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.270
 simple little bit of oil and a little bit of 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.490
 salt 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.970
 we aim quickly and go and put it 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.970
 in the tray 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.100
 this is our curry sea ​​bass 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.100
 enjoy your meal
