00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.250
 The plan is here with another video 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 And this time we're going to give 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 continuity to our texture 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 the staff spoke sports you did not 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 finished 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.170
 the really personal ores do not 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 finished the ore was missing here 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 emerald then tell me what you 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 found the emerald of our texture 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 because the texture is also yours and the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.570
 Staff spoke to make it clearer. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.030
 I iron it, I have trouble 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.480
 Personally I'm kind of bi in photoshop but 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 It's okay and I made two more bids. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.539
 to be faster here 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 I think in the next video I'm going 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.770
 finish the lans nÃ© 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.390
 and I think it's getting pretty cool because 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.890
 the streets this way will favor the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170
 personal that also makes pixel art 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.320
 including me because I will be doing 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.000
 pixel art with our texture and I did 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 this block here 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 in fact it was a writer a friend did 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.439
 is the common brick block shouted that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.450
 added the musicians here with you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.909
 you can see it was very interesting as well 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 cool and the cracked did not look so cool 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.810
 answered only got cracked here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 So I'll be changing to see if it can 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 give improved it and come up 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.170

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.170
 O here or negligence can be you 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.509
 You can see it is just like the stone but 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 She's purple, I understand. I wonder if 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.740
 Do you want to divert purple or black? 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.990
