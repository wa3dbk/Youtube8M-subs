00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.870
 have you noticed if we cut out the maps to pick-up racing fit 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.079
 perfectly 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.449
 as if they were brothers separated by time 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 Any similarity is not coincidental 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.429
 I do not know if they 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.279
 the time 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.159
 the formation of planet earth 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.880
 about four and a half million years ago 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.069
 at the same time as he resigned 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.910
 the hand made 45 goals 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.200
 I used to talk 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.880
 but the earth at that time 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
 it was quite different from what we are used to seeing today 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660
 long ago the world and the government itself 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 the planet information 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.870
 it was all liquid 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.000
 not water but if they were a decent car 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.180
 and atmosphere enough to withstand 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 part of the land remains until today 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 are the buttons 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 while active 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.210
 sends us directly in the face of the earth 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.210
 It's like making a trip to the past. 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.009
 4x2 and a half years ago 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.060
 when the earth the planets which 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 had just been born 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 this is what I'm going to miss it is on the island that gives the name of the archipelago of hawaii 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.280
 in this part of the earth 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.100
 there is a time with them 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.860
 that the region is called the circus 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 Publication 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.890
 but none is as old as the proer 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.390
 it erupted January 1983 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600
 did not stop anymore 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.570
 I'm close to time travel 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.080
 and we see how it was land at the beginning 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.070
 the images would not be very different challenges that shows the period of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.930
 activities that are more intense than 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.700
 during the first 700 million years 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.899
 the land was like this 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.750
 as with respondents 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 and preferred the volcano he spits lava 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.750
 flying over a gentleman can be seen clearly as the lava is expelled by the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 volcano cools in contact with sea water 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.709
 this definite study and increase the size of the island 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.999
 our planet is like this 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.979
 the place today there is nothing or open sea can come up an idea since 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.089
 is a region of volcanic activity 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.090
 slowly 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.480
 olavo was referring 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.789
 and is astonished 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.029
 the same happened to the surface of our planet 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.379
 only in the case of land it took 600 million years 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.290
 when the efficient bassul temperature opa that it circulated by the rudder overcomes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.169
 and when I am turned welcome drops 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.759
 a long time has passed 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.679
 then from some 200 million years ago until the beginning 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.289
 the way it is today 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.639
 most of the surface was already covered with water 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.399
 but there was only one continent 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:28.709
 Sun Joseph 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.709
 king rego means that all lands in the world 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.259
 knowledge of the land mass which gave origin to the continents 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.979
 he was unhappy 2 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.219
 this happened 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.549
 the other very long called process of continental drift 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.039
 the outermost layer of Florida land is divided 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:49.959
 in port st 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.249
 paulista 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.669
 As they are called 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.789
 these future boards about injured so far 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.019
 and still with transmitted 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.099
 slowly 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.939
 over millions of years 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.649
 it is intended have distanced themselves until it reaches what it is today 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.159
 and so 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.159
 that applies brazil seems to fit perfectly 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.229
 after a long time ago 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.139
 they were one thing 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.879
 continental drift did not stop 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.639
 keeps distancing itself every year
