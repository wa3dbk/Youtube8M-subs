00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.220 
the map it's a lot like the crew it
seems<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:46.940> there's<00:02:47.120> other<00:02:47.390> players<00:02:47.930> and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
seems like there's other players and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.760 
seems like there's other players and
other<00:02:48.520> four-man<00:02:49.520> teams<00:02:50.210> how<00:02:50.900> roaming<00:02:51.560> around

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
other four-man teams how roaming around

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.220 
other four-man teams how roaming around
the<00:02:52.550> world<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.150> would<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.750> cool<00:02:53.960> to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
the world so it would be really cool to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.250 
the world so it would be really cool to
bump<00:02:54.590> into<00:02:54.890> them<00:02:55.010> maybe<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:56.300> maybe<00:02:56.840> we'll

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
bump into them maybe just maybe we'll

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.370 
bump into them maybe just maybe we'll
see<00:02:57.740> seeing<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.850> pdps<00:02:59.450> well<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.050> option

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
see seeing this pdps well and the option

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.260 
see seeing this pdps well and the option
to<00:03:00.470> take<00:03:00.680> them<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:01.130> in<00:03:01.160> some<00:03:01.700> sort<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:01.970> manner

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
to take them on in some sort of manner

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.180 
to take them on in some sort of manner
so<00:03:02.720> I'm<00:03:02.780> really<00:03:02.990> curious<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.350> see<00:03:03.410> what<00:03:03.980> that

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
so I'm really curious to see what that

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.280 
so I'm really curious to see what that
is<00:03:04.250> all<00:03:04.580> Ballard<00:03:04.940> reminds<00:03:05.270> me<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> lot<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.930> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
is all Ballard reminds me a lot of the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.960

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
crew you can approach the missions

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.660

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
you remember Ghost Recon did have some

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.990 
you remember Ghost Recon did have some
stealth<00:03:12.710> elements<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.700> can<00:03:13.730> equip

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
development for quite some time so my

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.809 
development for quite some time so my

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
guess is ball 2016 would probably be a

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.119 
guess is ball 2016 would probably be a
reasonable<00:06:18.719> window<00:06:19.229> for<00:06:19.669> Ghost<00:06:20.669> Recon
