 lugar with him in 2010 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 could win this derby after he 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 1999 also won here 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 went from the square and we have until then 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 there were a few steps at the age of eight 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.320
 So two fault points were ended 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 10 have a total of these 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.219
 course does not end so it is today 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 very very difficult 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 zero fault ride and carsten otto nagel 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.320
 heard with this experienced horse lex 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 Lugar without doubt to the favorites in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 This year is 13 years old 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.360
 Stallion's as well as a diesel is said 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.960
 the long wait for work but here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.719
 The first mistake makes when riding 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.359
 He was very very much on this water 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.549
 hesitant stupid mistake at all 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.280
 does not have to happen because lex lugar before 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.280
 Water is not afraid and in all 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.170
 rule also no mistakes but now 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.690
 especially upswing 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.680
 with it the ten above and then with courage and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.350
 skill and trust and caution 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.910
 ball down a jump and behind it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.410
 the flank as he is 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.260
 has done and now for you 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.960
 this forest after the jump of this 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.880
 dig the water hard to assess 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.160
 after the heavy task after the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.290
 nervous tension from the ball 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.260
 Often a source of error so it stays 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.600
 at these four fault points by the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.170
 mistake what but he would that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
 take over leadership 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.229
 the most powerful obstacles in the course 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 this citizen victim is still today 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.390
 not so good at all 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.040
 jump 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 despite 1 meter 90 deep buochser 70 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.110
 Deep lex lugar does that very well 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.060
 both are very good in rhythm very much 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.830
 good speed now the barriers the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 railroad barriers they see it in 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.340
 this attitude there is nothing could 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.610
 they just hang in the air and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 At least one meter sounds 55 and 1 meter 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.100
 59 and pay attention to the time here 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.290
 a normal big price long long 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.880
 long finish every olympic bring 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.530
 every world championship course and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.100
 now powder man's degree 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.070
 a little bit downhill the water 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 no problem 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.330
 playfully carsten otto nagel goes along 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.930
 lex lugar about this becomes the water bug 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.010
 more and more annoying the stone wall should be 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.739
 not a problem 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.410
 so it is still two obstacles 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.810
 holsteiner lanes jumps 13 meters 20 die 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.150
 distance usually to these two 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 galloping jumps are eleven meters 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.049
 So maybe right to the front 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.150
 jump on the playful and then 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.829
 The brick wall finally 1 again 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.540
 meter 60 high but that should not 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:12.299
 The leadership is the problem 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.810
 carsten otto nail the girlfriend with the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.019
 back to us Get Low was a 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.560
 pronounced 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.299
 great rode great show of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.060
 carsten otto nail kazemi otto nail 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.040
 will submit no zero error rode on 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.560
 entire afternoon in this heaviest 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.109
 parcours the world since 1920 almost 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.299
 unchanged in the line guidance in the 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.620
 obstacle follow here in small 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.540
 Flottbek presents 14 riders have the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.859
 Parking meters did not finish it was right 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.810
 It has been raining heavily in the meantime 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.250
 we see mylene diederich Meier on 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.849
 jumper the girlfriend of justin 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.549
 otto nail favorites like marcus ehning 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:58.500
 All of them did not come 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.389
 in this sting at the 84th 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.900
 circulation now so again seven 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:08.629
 obstacles eight jumps 380 meters yet 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.500
 to gallop 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.450
 it is doubly exciting 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.549
 slightly rattled but everything is 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.880
 now the gate has come 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.810
 one offering 61 only three meters wide one 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.370
 narrow and becomes very light and easy 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.740
 Now carsten Otto Nagel has something 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.660
 Take a ride on these act 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 the most powerful obstacles in the course 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.250
 with 1 meter 90 deep buochser at 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.790
 the horses ever go to the bottom 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.830
 looking down as well as lex lugar 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.720
 the 13 year old stallion with whom he was in 2010 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.450
 The railway has already won here 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:53.330
 slender quite airy built-off for 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.140
 carsten otto nail the last jump the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.280
 brick wall remains so that's it 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.270
 the measure 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 that is what to beat for now 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.640
 gilbert tillmann carsten otto nagel 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.849
 drop 53 64 seconds 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.110
 and of course now 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:20.050
 Give Gilbert tillmann time 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.749
 but he has to tackle everything very precisely 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.580
 here these airy barriers at 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:27.509
 once a support of Hans gÃ¼nter 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.509
 Winkler in the prick
