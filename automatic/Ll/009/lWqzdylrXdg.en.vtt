 Yup 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.150
 The 5th first of this cooking corner of tv 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 The food is 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.820
 I used the chicken breast here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540
 What 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.070
 Low temperature cooking 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.800
 With low stop 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 I make things , but I am not familiar with the low temperature cooking roast at home, surprisingly 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.170
 Maybe 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:03.150
 I think if you say Well easy Well it's a word that is in the TV programs and the like come out well recently 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 The food of such contents that finish softly without hardening the protein at low temperature 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:13.180
 First of all, I made a roast of breasts at this distance . 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.060
 Using it to make derived food 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.509
 Please have a good look at everyone because we are made 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.479
 Though it is breast of this bird to use in today 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.479
 You may not have to peel the skin for the time being 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 It is the end of the skin 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.670
 You're back 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.570
 Easiest way to do pin Lotte is suppressed here with a kitchen knife 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.830
 I can take it , but you know everyone 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.310
 Well, today I only take a bit of this fat part for a while 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.310
 No oil 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.210
 There is a little bit of muscle here, but this is also a little bit fine 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.580
 We have 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.010
 Well this state 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.060
 To this state 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:03.890
 It is after you have finished coming off a go you skin burn me 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:09.530
 Though Although I got to salt and pepper I want to put down the load is really 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 When this tablespoon Toka grams Toka little there is no what both unspeakable also put out in this regard 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.880
 I mean 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.930
 Because there is a difficult part 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.310
 It's a bit of a good idea to see how it's actually falling 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.730
 In that in my own way 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.490
 Both of flying 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 I want you to remember 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.060
 It is feeling 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.620
 Yes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:42.170
 It is this rifle on one side, but what do you think is cool of this specification 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:48.880
 Believe in the last work, please plan and shake salt 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 This is about the guarantee, too much on one side and so on the back too 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.000
 From now on 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.750
 About 10 minutes 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.040
 I Okun Although Well waving use put about 10 minutes and so I mean this osmotic pressure of the specification 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:11.530
 When it becomes delicious that a little salt gets into it and says 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:16.349
 If you don't want to be the best , shake your hand and burn it right away. 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.349
 I think it seems like it was a little rest 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:27.370
 This process uses this oven because it is a low-temperature cooked roast of chicken breasts 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:33.040
 At home you have a little set to 150 degrees 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 Agreed Actually at a slightly lower temperature the protein will harden but I will do it at home 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.250
 150 videos in 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:43.300
 Since it has become a guide to 150 degrees it has been set in the future residual heat 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.720
 Since a ne application is from now we are in now furiously 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.620
 From now on this 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:54.290
 In the feeling that the film is stretched rather than the baked sweet potato 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.040
 I put the fire in the pan, but the color used is olive oil in consideration of your health 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.980
 Because 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.790
 Anything anymore but because I do not after the cage's your mom anything for the time being the other, even dish 0 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.989
 Anything like this is fine 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.989
 Hitachi City 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.310
 Please take a look at this is a little about 2 tablespoons 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.940
 th 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.560
 It is watery, only this 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:28.690
 It Is Canaan say this steam from you anymore after softening 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:32.330
 I'm going to do it, and I'll put it in and I 'm not going to bake it 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.820
 Because I put a film, it's too hot at this point 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.300
 I dropped in will continue Well do not know Well everyone in such a measure in the same way kick off 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.300
 That's why 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:50.949
 This so soft 22 gate a little so high temperature 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.949
 Here's how I got this without putting it on fire 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.889
 It is empty as it is 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.909
 But this back 4 thinks 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:05.670
 No, but this feeling is trying to ferocious yet Description 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.120
 And say which way did you feel in the region of this oil 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.470
 2 Chika 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.689
 Time a little um 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.440
 Please look 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.590
 Almost behind 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.380
 As it has become white by one , it is almost a staple 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.380
 It's something like this, because it's a little white nowadays 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.760
 It is a naive feeling 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.760
 I do not think that the foot mark is removed 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:40.780
 It is each tap water about Otsu Kenhi 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:43.710
 Once you put a mark in such a feeling Well I was Midori-chan 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.710
 And this is my sister 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.360
 Something like this 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.360
 So it is in the oven, which had been allowed to warm to this earlier warm 150 degrees 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.580
 this 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.750
 It is time of this time when we put area where we put on explosion 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.280
 1 first 8 minutes 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:23.569
 Well, I'm just a guide, but then the size of the bird is a bit bigger 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:27.559
 Small Toka by 4 minutes of that and just approximate Miya like 8 minutes 8 minutes that before and after 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:31.819
 And once again set a little 8 minutes I put 8 minutes 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:35.770
 It takes a total of 20 minutes to go out and rest for 4 minutes 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:41.090
 I think it would be nice if you think that it is such a standard 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:44.620
 I just won 8 minutes 8 minutes 8 minutes 16 minutes 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.620
 Though it is in the state of entering 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.990
 This is it 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.820
 Oh 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:57.620
 And the fact that out already seen eye swollen and was the gravy is only now 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.070
 I have a little finger, but I wonder if it is this feeling of elasticity Basically this flower 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.260
 this 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:09.910
 It's about the elasticity of the top now I can touch this a little and this can be done 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:09.910
 This is such is after Once baked up here in about this 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:20.510
 Here, by 4 rest from here total Article 2 relationship 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:23.320
 It feels like it's in the refrigerator after 4 minutes today 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.320
 You Chai East
