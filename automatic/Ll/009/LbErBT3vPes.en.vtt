00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.320
 Hello own face with you and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.509
 today do not share the thoughts that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.350
 I think many tankers will be useful 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.150
 decided to pump German level 5 pt 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.279
 patient 4c 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 world of tanks already have a grill and now 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.119
 the developers have added more brazier 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 looking a little becomes 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 I think its obvious purpose on 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.250
 it can easily be done excellent 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
 skewers of lamb or venison but 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.610
 practice shows reality a little 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.410
 different fight 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 which I took the master a little 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.120
 boring we stood ours with a platoon 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.610
 in one place and most of the more 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.039
 just shot the enemies but despite 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 I have something to share with you 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 Perhaps we will start with the pluses immediately rushes 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.520
 pretty decent eyes for pc 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 good dynamic characteristics 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 maximum speed nice ride 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 in place, in general, setting up well 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 Pre-top gun flag 37 I generally 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.790
 she was really very happy 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.560
 not bad 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.170
 excellent horizontal guidance angles 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.510
 alpha and breakthrough are also good plus 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 rate of fire by the way is pretty 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 not bad rises up and it's not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 surprising after all this is universal 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.700
 anti-aircraft gun in general 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.820
 Personally, I was happy with everything but with each 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.830
 a new battle, the opinion gradually deteriorated 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.110
 having played about 20 fights on it in a row I 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.530
 concluded that this tank does not drag 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 see for yourself and safety margin 350 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.439
 units with no reservation at all 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.450
 tank vanshot with many enemies and even 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 such as low-level fugasnitsy 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.149
 we are terrified to hold us in battle 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.270
 a glance there are two phases of play on this Fri 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.640
 life dose of light and a moment after 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.369
 as on the previous friend the best 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.979
 Friends bushes nursery rhyme is because we 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.930
 punch all its all the projections we need 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.780
 stay inconspicuous by the way 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.450
 masking rate is rather average 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.909
 the silhouette of the car is so high that it is not 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.280
 all bushes are able to close us at the same time 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.530
 if the enemy will guess what course on it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.880
 shoots like I've had several times 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 then miss 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.920
 for us it's just impossible beyond 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.050
 light bulbs I would still advise watching 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.670
 enemies and if they became a long time 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.770
 look our way 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.650
 with the ox then roll back just in case 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.170
 to a safe distance besides i would 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.690
 wanted to warn the top gun flak 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 41 is unique to this tank 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.940
 glance at his characteristics 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.260
 I noticed that she is not very me 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 suit pritopat 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.000
 but this is not the main thing is the parameter 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.070
 who does not see in tth it angles 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 horizontal guidance they 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.140
 indecently narrow besides our 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.410
 problems with the fact that the guns weakly bends 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.540
 down so we are still being offered to take away from mr 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.090
 in general, I would not recommend you 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.630
 explore this weapon extra 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.550
 by argument 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.310
 I would also indicate the cost of research 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.650
 16 half thousand experience is a lot 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.550
 with all this if we add more 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 10,000 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.650
 then we are examined next photo by myself 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.920
 Of course you decide, but I did exactly 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.590
 so to summarize, I would say that this 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.300
 uniquely passing machines on the fifth 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.460
 level there are instances and for the best 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.320
 feelings mixed but most 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.770
 I remember my fear 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.310
 scary even standing in the bushes are afraid that 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.350
 Fugas will fly in fear of all tanks 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.330
 ram this feature is certainly not inherent 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.760
 imba tanks generally passed and forgot and 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.280
 at the end of this passage after the battle I 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.590
 show you a small excerpt like on it 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.730
 I acted on another card in 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.300
 urban setting 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.970
 also the quality of the veto I would recommend 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.430
 choose the direction of where the enemies are 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.620
 at a great distance from you and except 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.380
 not to get into a big mess with 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.870
 large crowds of enemies like you already 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.750
 guess I wanted to take a medal 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 brothers in arms and judging because my 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.040
 allies stubbornly climb forward I already understood 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.870
 what a medal we still have to 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.080
 there was no time to be possessed 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.209
 so I with incomplete information fell 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.130
 loved his enemy 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.759
 on ensk everything looked a little more 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.250
 rainbow the number of tanks was about 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.440
 the same but our location 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.650
 Allies was so impudent that I 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.280
 also decided to act a little more 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.190
 dangerous and in principle it's pretty good 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.259
 revealed the advantage of this Fri and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.770
 urban conditions due to the wide 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.020
 corners 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.050
 aiming good dynamics 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.449
 rate of fire they can also 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.720
 rather successfully act on the sly 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:59.000
 but again as carefully as possible and 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.000
 try not to take damage 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.040
 even tank level 3 without problems us 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:17.310
 punches me very much like a warrior I already 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.090
 set his sights on artillery and now 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:25.610
 check how it pt 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.610
 resists a landmine well, something like this 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:35.060
 shooting a rather meager value 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:39.960
 experience I had on the basis of 1484 damage 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.730
 three frags and we finally got a medal 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.240
 brothers in arms for two with my co 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.990
 platoon 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.500
 in the end I got only 895 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.780
 honest experience that proves once again 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.860
 the fact that this tank is pretty fast 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.750
 passes and people do not stay on it 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.970
 besides this fight is quite unique 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.240
 so that we are simultaneously with my co 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.730
 albert platoon master took on 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.150
 one tank in one fight two people 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.970
 take 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.100
 masters on my practice for the first time 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.480
 There is such a situation Thank you 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.480
 for your attention and see you soon 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.450
 here
