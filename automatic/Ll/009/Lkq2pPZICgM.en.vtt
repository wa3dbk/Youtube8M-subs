Clippy CLI ppy and test it out for
yourself<00:04:38.360> supposedly<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.229> in<00:04:39.320> beta<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:39.860> i

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
yourself supposedly it's in beta but i

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.140 
yourself supposedly it's in beta but i
don't<00:04:40.250> see<00:04:40.310> anything<00:04:40.520> beta<00:04:41.020> about<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.229> yet<00:04:42.410> and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.060 

actually<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.870> only<00:04:48.080> problem<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.650> have<00:04:48.800> found

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
actually the only problem I have found

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.460 
actually the only problem I have found
is<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.300> have<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.720> have<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.870> keyboard<00:04:51.139> up

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
is that you have to have a keyboard up

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.439 
is that you have to have a keyboard up
in<00:04:51.590> order<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.830> copy<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.220> paste<00:04:52.400> which<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.419> I

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
in order to copy and paste which is I

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.279 
in order to copy and paste which is I
guess<00:04:53.949> kind<00:04:54.949> of<00:04:55.039> assume<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.580> but<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.389> see<00:04:57.110> that

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
guess kind of assume that but I see that

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.350 
guess kind of assume that but I see that
means<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.590> can't<00:04:57.830> copy<00:04:58.099> something<00:04:59.060> off<00:04:59.330> of

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
means you can't copy something off of

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.219 
means you can't copy something off of
Google<00:04:59.900> unless<00:05:00.199> you<00:05:00.320> have<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.470> keyboard<00:05:00.919> up

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
Google unless you have the keyboard up

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.230 
Google unless you have the keyboard up
so<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.740> just<00:05:03.770> see<00:05:04.130> you<00:05:04.280> know<00:05:04.340> right<00:05:05.030> out<00:05:05.210> just

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
so you just see you know right out just

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.310 
so you just see you know right out just
give<00:05:05.930> credit<00:05:06.289> work<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.580> mean<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:08.000> the
