00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hello, how are you? What are you doing? 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.370
 follow and I do not love makeup I go 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.920
 show with my Aryan guest a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 practical makeup and with products that I 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 I love it and I'm already preparing the skin 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 with the 3 in 1 base which is a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.490
 very practical in the very practical arena and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 I love this on a single base product. 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 corrective and powder 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 so I use the face game that base it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 has sun protection 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.329
 it leaves your skin hydrated and can be 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 used by all skin types and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.840
 eyes area chose the quartet with 4 has 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.270
 an honorable graphite pearl and a beige I 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 I'll start with graphite by applying 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 every movable eyelid you create a bait 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 to the upper eyelashes and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.370
 then spreads in the direction of the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.370
 eye 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.809
 the new watercolor shadow can also 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.520
 be used with the tip of your finger 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.219
 then the graphite I took a little bit of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
 pink always picking up the excess on the back 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 of hand 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.640
 place in the middle of the moving eyelid 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.229
 graphite as if it were giving 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 one illuminated in paulo 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.540
 if you want to reinforce pass hide 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 also and now i will not mix the color 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.509
 beige and pearl are the clearest of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 quartet 4 in the study here in hand nor 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.450
 Applying near the brow without getting 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.580
 very white plated retreat access 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.650
 It was there that I loved it. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.440
 Let's finish our eyes, let's go to the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:47.040
 super black mask five times more 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:47.040
 volume to the maximum looks there is the queen 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.940
 Only the makeup on the eyes does not 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.250
 It's over because I'm going to use a 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.400
 product that I love is the eyeliner 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.470
 liquid starts long before suit 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.190
 leaving thicker than a pull 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.190
 up 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.890
 max I always used the eyeliner is da 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.200
 mask 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 It's also okay, you can do so. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 but if you apply the mask it's just being 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.510
 it to dry and then place the product 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.670
 Good for the new gloss 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.910
 you know that it now moisturizes 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.700
 lips for up to 12 hours and a brand-new 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.900
 lipstick gloss in one product you have 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.300
 color and enough brightness which you prefer 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.150
 I want to attack chaos in the then let's go 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.180
 There the new lip gloss has the color of lipstick 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.070
 and the brightness of the gloss applied directly 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.840
 on the side to make it more transparent 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.730
 more natural 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.100
 now if you want a more 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.230
 use the product with a 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.000
 own 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 Good, now its time to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.310
 try practicing and devastating enough 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:06.290
 with all this colorfulness of nature 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:08.290
 watercolor a kiss and until her possession 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.290
 ah
