work<00:00:38.310> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.940> better<00:00:39.120> than<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.750> exacto<00:00:40.410> knife

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

work a lot better than an exacto knife
the<00:00:40.830> exacto<00:00:41.250> knife<00:00:41.430> blades<00:00:41.460> tend<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.390> break

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the exacto knife blades tend to break

when<00:00:43.320> trying<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.650> cut<00:00:43.830> plexiglass<00:00:45.410> but<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
when trying to cut plexiglass but you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:58.630 
when trying to cut plexiglass but you
also<00:00:46.680> need<00:00:47.010> an<00:00:47.250> exacto<00:00:47.760> knife<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.080> pencil

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.710 

first<00:00:59.640> off<00:00:59.880> you<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.600> determine

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
first off you will need to determine

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.110 
first off you will need to determine

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
I'm going to make a fairly small one

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.930 
I'm going to make a fairly small one
today<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.410> need<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.860> nice<00:01:08.190> portable<00:01:08.640> 1i

today because I need a nice portable 1i

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.290 
today because I need a nice portable 1i
can<00:01:09.210> use<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.960> painting<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.770> any<00:01:11.700> size<00:01:12.030> will

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
can use for painting had any size will

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.360 
can use for painting had any size will
work<00:01:12.330> though<00:01:12.660> I've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
large one that I've constructed here and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.730 
large one that I've constructed here and
what's<00:01:18.420> great<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.690> these<00:01:19.020> large<00:01:19.290> ones<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
what's great about these large ones is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
what's great about these large ones is
that<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.430> lay<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> lot<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that you can put out lay out a lot of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
that you can put out lay out a lot of
different<00:01:21.900> colors<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.710> you're

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
different colors so if you're you're
going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.760> working<00:01:23.910> with<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.240> lot<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
going to be working with a lot of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.440 
going to be working with a lot of
different<00:01:24.630> colors<00:01:25.220> mixing<00:01:26.220> paint<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
different colors mixing paint then you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.969 
different colors mixing paint then you
might<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> make<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.050> larger<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.800> like

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
might want to make a larger one like

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
might want to make a larger one like
this<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.660> now<00:01:30.690> I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.890> be

going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.300> make<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.630> five<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> three<00:01:40.320> eighths

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
going to make up five and three eighths

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.200 
going to make up five and three eighths
by<00:01:40.770> five<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> three<00:01:41.550> eighths<00:01:41.700> inch<00:01:42.110> palette

by five and three eighths inch palette
so<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> measurements<00:01:50.570> making

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
so you'll make the measurements making

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
so you'll make the measurements making
marks<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:52.050> five<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.500> three<00:01:52.710> eighths<00:01:52.830> on<00:01:53.070> both

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
marks at five and three eighths on both

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.730 
marks at five and three eighths on both
edges<00:01:56.600> turns<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> piece<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.380> already

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
edges turns out this piece is already

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.080 
edges turns out this piece is already
five<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> three<00:01:59.310> eighths<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.700> way<00:02:05.090> make

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
five and three eighths this way make

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.440 
five and three eighths this way make
your<00:02:06.240> mark<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:07.489> then<00:02:08.489> with<00:02:08.700> your<00:02:08.850> utility

color will turn out when I painted brush

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.720 
color will turn out when I painted brush
it<00:04:44.300> onto<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:45.080> canvas<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.340> cut<00:04:49.580> out<00:04:49.610> a

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
it onto the canvas so you cut out a

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.490 
it onto the canvas so you cut out a
piece<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:50.000> white<00:04:50.270> paper<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.960> size<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.380> need

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
for your palate and then take the edges

up the sharp edge on the other side and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.560 
up the sharp edge on the other side and
you<00:05:52.919> can<00:05:53.040> just<00:05:53.190> trim<00:05:53.400> off<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.820> excess<00:05:54.210> tape
