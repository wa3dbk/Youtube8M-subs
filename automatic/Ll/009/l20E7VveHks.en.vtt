00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.260
 Tell me guys, how good is it to get started? 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 year 2015 on the right foot could not

 stop making the river of this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 of the company to the sport and this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.460
 is the vp2 protein a protein isolated in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 enough protein in academies 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 however by more advanced users it is a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 protein you do not listen to is 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.810
 as a NALP protein daily talk 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 or protein plus the galera here more 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.990
 advanced search engine that typically searches more 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.990
 finally 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.930
 well this is the only 100% isolated protein 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.060
 hydrolyzed aet 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 it has little diversity of flavors and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.260
 products being that it is very difficult for you 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.360
 find a problem if you have 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 because the demand is very high. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 big company that does this kind of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 import always lowers 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.810
 quantity then it is always very difficult 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.160
 find this type of protein or any 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 st product 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 which is a wonder but the taste is not 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.070
 bad and I did scup weight and on the table 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.320

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.550

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.900
 and for those who know ronaldo félix he 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
 the target of this protein and this was the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.480
 This is not the only protein I 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.120
 spent 100% glauber the portion of them 28 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.280
 grams in the packaging is showing 23 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.920
 grams of protein by the award 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 So, congratulations , I played sports there. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 nutrition by 100% album né 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.830
 good the price of it really a little 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.620
 salted in Brazil in view of the fact that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.350
 law of 900 grams 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:14.450
 is more or less in the range of 36 hours more 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.459
 the fred 83 around 102 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.160
 Forward in Brazil give a searched 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.750
 quick here on some websites 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.879
 I found her in the range of 250 reais to 300 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.209
 Is this really beneficent to explain 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.519
 to 300 reais is a money and it is not 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.290
 of a pound and a half is not 900 grams 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.080
 then very high investment money 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.519
 very high in protein mother-in-law 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.030
 money to invest 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.090
 So here's the hint of this protein 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.959
 da st sport reported bt2 protein 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.849
 isolated 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.560
 I do not think you're going to buy this 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.870
 you will gain muscle mass 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.299
 You'll grow and you'll catch the air. 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.720
 remembering that it will always be a set 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.459
 of diet and rest train implementation 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.860

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.250
