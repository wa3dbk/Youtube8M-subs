00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
going to be using that one for one of my

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to be using that one for one of my
base<00:01:56.500> images<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.789> allows<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.270> do<00:01:58.420> that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
base images so it allows you to do that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.190 
base images so it allows you to do that
and<00:01:59.280> yeah<00:02:00.280> let's<00:02:00.759> go<00:02:00.970> use<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.960> take<00:02:02.020> some

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
and yeah let's go use it and take some

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.770 
and yeah let's go use it and take some
photos<00:02:06.000> silhouettes<00:02:07.000> are<00:02:07.179> a<00:02:07.210> really<00:02:07.539> fun

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
photos silhouettes are a really fun

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.449 
photos silhouettes are a really fun
place<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.080> start<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.009> can<00:02:09.250> blow<00:02:09.429> out

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
place to start because you can blow out

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.640 
place to start because you can blow out
the<00:02:09.700> sky<00:02:09.940> behind<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.390> person<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.049> the<00:02:11.290> second

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the sky behind the person and the second

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.229 
the sky behind the person and the second
image<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:11.980> take<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.370> only<00:02:12.640> going<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.970> fill<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
image you take is only going to fill the

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.900 
image you take is only going to fill the
dark<00:02:13.420> areas<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.170> first<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.549> have<00:02:15.579> some

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
dark areas of the first so we have some

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.240 
dark areas of the first so we have some
base<00:02:16.090> images<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> shot<00:02:17.170> earlier<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.890> now

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
base images that I shot earlier and now

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.890 
base images that I shot earlier and now
we<00:02:18.310> need<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.610> find<00:02:18.850> some<00:02:19.120> textures<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.720> fill

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
we need to find some textures to fill

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.860 
we need to find some textures to fill
them<00:02:20.049> with<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:21.010> mark<00:02:21.310> 3<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.820> awesome<00:02:22.510> because

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
them with the mark 3 is awesome because

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.960 
them with the mark 3 is awesome because
if<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.320> use<00:02:23.440> live<00:02:23.829> view<00:02:23.860> which<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.549> highly

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
if you use live view which I highly

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.360 
if you use live view which I highly
suggest<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:26.500> show<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.920> overlay<00:02:27.340> of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
suggest it will show you the overlay of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.100 
suggest it will show you the overlay of
both<00:02:27.700> images<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.750> won't<00:02:28.959> have<00:02:29.049> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
both images and you won't have to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.960 
both images and you won't have to
remember<00:02:29.440> where<00:02:29.739> your<00:02:29.860> previous<00:02:30.280> composition

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
remember where your previous composition

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.170 
remember where your previous composition
was<00:02:31.470> now<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.799> menu<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.160> remember<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.820> chose

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
was now in the menu you remember I chose

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.020 
was now in the menu you remember I chose
to<00:02:34.450> save<00:02:34.810> all<00:02:35.049> images<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:36.340> saves<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> two

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
to save all images this saves the two

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.180 
to save all images this saves the two
photos<00:02:37.390> individually<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.890> composite

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
photos individually and the composite

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.520 
photos individually and the composite
result<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.180> raw<00:02:40.359> form<00:02:40.660> which<00:02:41.109> is<00:02:41.260> why<00:02:41.380> I'm

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
result all in raw form which is why I'm

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.710 
result all in raw form which is why I'm
able<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.799> show<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.280> before<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.609> afters

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.210 

sometimes<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.870> want<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.260> more<00:02:49.560> context

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
sometimes I want to have more context

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
sometimes I want to have more context
and<00:02:50.370> facial<00:02:50.700> texture<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> subject<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
and facial texture in the subject if you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.680 
and facial texture in the subject if you
have<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.280> directional<00:02:53.910> sunlight<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.660> can

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
have really directional sunlight you can

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.720 
have really directional sunlight you can
have<00:02:55.320> your<00:02:55.530> subject<00:02:55.710> face<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.340> light<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
have your subject face to light and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.990 
have your subject face to light and
slightly<00:02:57.060> under<00:02:57.450> expose<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> skin<00:02:58.170> tones

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
slightly under expose the skin tones

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.310 
slightly under expose the skin tones
you're<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.300> end<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.540> shooting<00:03:00.780> upward<00:03:01.200> a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
you're going to end up shooting upward a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.900 
you're going to end up shooting upward a
lot<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.740> time<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.430> should<00:03:02.610> use<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
lot of the time and you should use the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.300 
lot of the time and you should use the
sky<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.240> your<00:03:03.570> advantage<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.740> great<00:03:05.100> for

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
sky to your advantage it's great for

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.190 
sky to your advantage it's great for
isolating<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> subject<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.080> background

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
isolating the subject and the background

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.890 
isolating the subject and the background
textures<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.820> example<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.570> shoot<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
textures for example if you shoot the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.170 
textures for example if you shoot the
top<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.320> tree<00:03:10.470> line<00:03:10.770> instead<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.670> directly

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
top of a tree line instead of directly

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
top of a tree line instead of directly
into<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> trees<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.320> sky<00:03:13.560> will<00:03:13.740> help<00:03:13.920> blow

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
into the trees the sky will help blow

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.590 
into the trees the sky will help blow
out<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.430> rest<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.850> image<00:03:15.150> behind<00:03:15.330> your

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
out the rest of the image behind your

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.410 
out the rest of the image behind your
head<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.340> purposely<00:03:17.340> kept<00:03:17.700> her<00:03:17.850> face<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
head I purposely kept her face in the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.120 
head I purposely kept her face in the
dark<00:03:18.690> part<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.050> second<00:03:19.500> image<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.040> can

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
dark part of the second image so you can

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:35.780 
dark part of the second image so you can
retain<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.700> full<00:03:20.880> facial<00:03:21.300> line<00:03:34.790> alright

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
retain the full facial line alright

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.640 
retain the full facial line alright
