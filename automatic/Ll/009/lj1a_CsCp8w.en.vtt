00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
small plane which is accurate to the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.460 
small plane which is accurate to the

your horse is on the original Ned that
was<00:02:47.070> released<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:47.760> look<00:02:48.270> very<00:02:48.300> good

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
was released and they look very good

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.410 
was released and they look very good
together<00:02:48.990> they're<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.650> inverted<00:02:50.610> colors<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
together they're just inverted colors of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.680 
together they're just inverted colors of
course<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:53.300> now<00:02:54.300> clearly<00:02:55.260> they're<00:02:55.800> even<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
course and now clearly they're even a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.350 
course and now clearly they're even a
different<00:02:57.690> color<00:02:58.020> green<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.040> see

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
different color green as you can see

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.300 
different color green as you can see
different<00:03:00.360> colored<00:03:00.780> greens<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.100> one

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
different colored greens and the one

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.510 
different colored greens and the one
thing<00:03:02.520> that's<00:03:02.730> kind<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.350> inaccurate<00:03:04.350> about

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
thing that's kind of inaccurate about

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.030 
thing that's kind of inaccurate about
Mattel<00:03:05.520> version<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.350> Zed's<00:03:07.350> eyebrow<00:03:07.860> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
Mattel version is that Zed's eyebrow is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.370 
Mattel version is that Zed's eyebrow is
actually<00:03:08.460> green<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.150> said<00:03:09.360> being<00:03:09.600> black<00:03:09.960> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
actually green and said being black and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.930 
actually green and said being black and
he<00:03:10.980> even<00:03:11.070> shows<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.000> card<00:03:12.330> here<00:03:13.940> see

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
wings and stuff of course if these um so

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.560 
wings and stuff of course if these um so
it's<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.550> heavy<00:03:53.790> that's<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:55.519> these<00:03:56.519> wheels<00:03:57.269> are

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
it's so heavy that's on these wheels are

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.150 
it's so heavy that's on these wheels are
getting<00:03:57.840> tired<00:03:58.080> here<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.590> they'll<00:03:58.709> they'll

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
getting tired here and they'll they'll

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.460 
getting tired here and they'll they'll
slump<00:03:59.610> down<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.150> spread<00:04:00.540> out<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.260> have

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
slump down and spread out so if you have

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.710 
slump down and spread out so if you have
them<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.310> surface<00:04:02.550> here<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.090> propeller

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
them on the surface here the propeller

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.930 
them on the surface here the propeller
won't<00:04:04.050> spin<00:04:04.440> unless<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.980> raise<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.550> up<00:04:05.670> and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
won't spin unless you raise them up and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.850 
won't spin unless you raise them up and
so<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.390> looks<00:04:06.660> really<00:04:06.900> weird<00:04:06.989> wings<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:07.709> like

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
so it looks really weird wings just like

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.780 
so it looks really weird wings just like
my<00:04:08.310> making<00:04:09.269> out<00:04:09.390> with<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.660> pavement<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.790> of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
my making out with the pavement but of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.750 
my making out with the pavement but of
course<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.300> eyes<00:04:12.600> Ed's<00:04:12.930> quite<00:04:13.410> new<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.100> it's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
course my eyes Ed's quite new so it's

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.710 
course my eyes Ed's quite new so it's
not<00:04:15.000> as<00:04:15.330> bad<00:04:15.750> but<00:04:16.140> if<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.280> compare<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.090> with<00:04:18.209> of

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
not as bad but if you compare it with of
