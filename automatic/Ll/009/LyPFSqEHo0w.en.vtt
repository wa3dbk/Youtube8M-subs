00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 two point zero 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 cetera 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.980

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.789
 Of course, keeping an eye out is also one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
 video on youtube 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 so you can keep an eye on that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.710
 what are we talking about again 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 are now going to talk about you being a him 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 two point zero and what's in it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 well we are going to lounge with 3 game oats 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.120
 namely tdm 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.739
 kidnapper and factions well let's 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 starting with factions fashion is one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 game where almost as a group being faction 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.090
 you can grow you can make a building 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 You can attack other buildings 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.460
 attack other factions and with that the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.469
 hey 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.270
 with it the entire faction world 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.730
 food that's the green it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 the purpose of factions you have an em 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 team deathmatch Well that means 15 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 against 15 20 against 20 differs per folder 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
 for example you have to get 100 kills and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 then you won as a team are the u 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.909
 can also be there in the game 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.530
 can open yes where you are in time 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.080
 the same time you have 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.330
 special items shaft kill streaks so this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 is just a very nice pvp festival 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 and certainly an improvement on the tdm 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 plugins like the first one had in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 to sit 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.040
 we also have kidnapper no 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 it actually kidnaps that demo team 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 original is not for us 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.950
 you let me come over from a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420
 other server since we have one 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.840
 developer have power 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.909
 he 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.549
 plug in too far or the server where that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 originally got up and gone offline 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.579
 he latte to get one here on time 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 iame put so we have too 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.579
 permission sought from those from whom 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 the that team in original or at least 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.299
 the ones who have run out of that plug-in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 server that runs and it has us 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.320
 Permission is therefore given for this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
 we you announce chip the kidnapper 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 is actually a game it seems like one 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.390
 bit after a second reading of the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 lock tree server 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 only a bit with another 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 turn it to the lubrication catcher face 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 after all you have to have a point 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.460
 gamecapture him 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 and you have to bring it back to the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.189
 other base like you a pump three times 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.320
 fake captured 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.909
