 So it gives that so we're not going to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.970
 to lie is downright mission 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 impossible to know first of all 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.730
 the choreographies of everything and dance there 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.870
 exists in box we will start well 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.370
 obviously intense power that all the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.659
 Tomb I think you have everything 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.680

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.180
 We have to do everything themselves agree that 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.280
 cause has arrived on board a small bus 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.720
 it's one of the most 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.740
 people do not know the girl there 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 happens this kind of situation 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.640
 politicians like it's weird we're going 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:38.409
 not things that in all that if I 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:39.880
 you talk about the macarena do match 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.140
 no one already has an evening 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:53.739
 birthday 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:55.179

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.619
 what it is but this dance and art 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.700
 it's really exceptional 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.679
 nice but after a warm up 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.179
 articulation is weird for 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.619
 children parties for six years of sport 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.909
 as you can see we started 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.340
 by articulations with vast 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.340
 hair just it's gone hard 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 at 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.360
 today in the dance analysis know 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:25.020
 not if I am what ramparts 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.770
 style Gones this attitude 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.090
 marked in the clip 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.800
 if we ever change background music 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.800
 something special 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.280
 it makes us take 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.200
 but it's like for the head 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.200
 it was even worse 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.490
 but vincent riesen I was talking to you 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.750
 of a tent everyone to 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.220
 equivalence at the time in your veins 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.300
 for speakers you can pay this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.590
 phase 1 which gave some 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.350
 directions to find the track 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.350

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.099
 patten watts of weight 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.099
 so you are yes 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.070
 then you have check wagons 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.120
 bédard for personal reasons 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.170
 the author of this video decided not to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.450
 not do this musical moment 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.069

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.810
