00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:13.740
 1160 first task under the letter a compare 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 and we are offered four full three fifths 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:24.449
 and 4 point 1 5 here look here four 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.300
 whole and here four whole whole part 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 equally let's compare the fractional part 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.180
 three fifths and 1 5 three fifths of course more 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.500
 than 1 5 then everything is mixed number more 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.719
 this number is the same as the denominators 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.219
 here are three and here are 13 more than one 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.289
 so this whole number is greater than this 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.789
 number 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.850
 the whole part is the same for this compared 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 the fractional part of 3 5 is greater than 1 5 therefore 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 4 point three fifths more than 4 1 5 under 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:10.640
 letter b 7.2 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:13.619
 and 6.8 here look if we have here 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.009
 the correct fraction of the ninth and here 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.590
 correct fraction eight ninth 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.900
 then we first compare only the whole 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 parts here are 7th here 6 7 more than 6 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.610
 so this number is greater than this number we 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.470
 do not look at the need to fractional part 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.350
 we only look at the whole part of it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.780
 the whole part is greater than this the whole part 7 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 greater than 6 therefore all this number 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.479
 more than this number so you can do 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.820
 only in cases when we have fractional 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 the part is correct we have the fractional part 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.659
 correct i.e. the numerator is less 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.829
 denominator 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.299
 if the numerator is less than the denominator then 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.700
 there is a fractional part right then this 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.780
 part less than one 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.420
 just if this part were not 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.430
 less than one, well, for example here it would be 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.340
 like this 8000 9 if we select the whole 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.020
 part there would be 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.170
 it would be a whole part and she would change 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 solution but since we 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.850
 both fractions are correct each of them 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.850
 less than one, so we only compare 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.020
 the whole part so on 9 whole three 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.080
 seventh 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:34.440
 and here 67 seventh there are two 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.860
 option or we allocate a whole from here 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.000
 part 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.420
 and compare these two numbers or this fraction 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.120
 let's translate out the right kind of let's 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.580
 translate into not the right kind 9 multiply 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.620
 at 7 it will be 63 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.090
 yes even three sixty six seventh if 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 we will transfer this fraction to the wrong one 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:06.390
 the view will be 67 seventh 6666 7 up and here 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.590
 67 7 does the same here take 66 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.790
 and there are 67 of course 67 7 more than 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.459
 sixty six seventh 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.110
 that is, while we have numbers different in 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.850
 differently recorded we can not compare 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.980
 therefore either we translate this into not 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.140
 the right kind or here we select the whole 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:28.380
 part we could also highlight the whole 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:31.760
 part how to stand out fate 67 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.100
 seventh 67 divide by 7 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:43.680
 take 99 by 7 is 63 subtract 7 minus 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:48.180
 3 t49 full four sevenths here would be 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.010
 nine point four sevens if you 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.260
 at first it is the wrong fraction of it 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.480
 would single out the whole part would be nine 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.459
 the whole four seventh and here was to be 9 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.160
 three whole seventh 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.470
 47 the whole part is the same here 9 and here 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.860
 94 seventh course more than three 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.489
 seventh 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:10.430
 that is, either from here we select the whole part 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.120
 and compare these two here or here 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.030
 translate in the wrong form and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.489
 compare it to this anyway 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.970
 sign here is this part of this number 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.650
 less than this number 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 so and the last that we have left under 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.870
 letter g 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:34.550
 david three quarter meters and two hundred 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:39.410
 sixty five centimeters 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.410
 the most convenient thing is to bring it to the meter 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:55.710
 2 meters plus another three fourth meters like 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:05:00.090
 would we calculate this 2 meters this is 200 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:04.979
 centimeters and 3 4 meters how to count in 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.370
 one meter 100 centimeters but we need 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.319
 not 100 centimeters but 3 4 meters therefore 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.509
 we divide by four to find out one 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:20.039
 fourth and then multiply by 3 100 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:23.520
 centimeters divided by 4 will be 25 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.130
 centimeters and multiply by 3 will be 75 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.449
 centimeters and that turns out two hundred 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:34.860
 seventy five centimeters 2 meters this 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.430
 200 centimeters and 3 4 meters is 75 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.130
 centimeters 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.659
 when we transferred now we can compare 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.070
 two hundred seventy five centimeters 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.949
 certainly more than two hundred and sixty 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.479
 five centimeters that's the way 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.550
 write everything is clear in the decision given 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.680
 tasks and if you like my videos by 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.520
 advise friends classmate on this 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.520
 all all bye
