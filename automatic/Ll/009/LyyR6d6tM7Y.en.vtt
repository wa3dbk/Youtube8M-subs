00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the secret of happiness and the pyramid of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.340
 maslow if we settle for that 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.099
 we have and thank for that then 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049
 we are happy it means left 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.330
 life unfold without having to force 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 or to focus on things 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 events when we trust 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.900
 life we â€‹â€‹are much more 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 to attract what we want because of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.789
 no longer resist that brings me to the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.240
 maslow theory on the hierarchy of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.560
 man's needs you know 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 masselot was a prominent psychologist 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 who developed a theory about 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 psychological need of the human being 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 his work is often represented under 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 the shape of a pyramid is mentioned 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.460
 as part of the education of the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.500
 motivation and training 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 commercial 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 the summary of this theory is nothing else 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
 that we humans have needs 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.289
 which must be satisfied in a 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.780
 order of priority before reaching this 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.420
 which corresponds to the highest ideals 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.840
 we must first respond to our 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.240
 basic needs the order of these 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.689
 needs does not change from an individual to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.900
 the other 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.680
 they are as follows level a need 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.049
 physiological 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 air water food resting exercises etc 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.939
 level 2 need for housing security 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.750
 job security retirement plan 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.820
 insurance etc 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.280
 level 3 need love and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.270
 of belonging children friends partners 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.900
 level 4 own love celebrity 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.590
 recognition reputation and dignity 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.590
 level 5 self-esteem trust 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 realization freedom if we do not answer 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.079
 not all the needs in the levels 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 lower 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.640
 we will always be missing and he 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.920
 will be hard to reach a more 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.180
 great achievement 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.939
 here is a little story that illustrates 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.579
 well the maslow ladder a lecturer 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.409
 rolls on a small deserted road in 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.560
 way for Darwin to give a 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.209
 conference on autonomy he thinks of the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 best way to captivate his 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.590
 audience and to live up to his 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.319
 reputation 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.530
 so here we are at level 4 5 of the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.470
 pyramid of maslow soudas it falls into 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.000
 breakdown out the temperature reaches the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.769
 44 degrees in the shade 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.640
 but there are no trees for 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.620
 take shelter he is in the middle of nowhere 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.500
 at first he is not concerned about the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.519
 situation and just admire the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 beauty of the landscape 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.410
 he begins to dwell on the past and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.239
 think of his friends and family by 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.280
 asking what he could do well 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.630
 now we get it turns on the radio 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.910
 and falls asleep when he wakes up he 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.340
 realize that he feels lonely and would like 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.329
 to have someone to talk to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.190
 go down to level 3 of the pyramid 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.200
 after a few hours he starts to get 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.840
 feel a little uncomfortable and without 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.930
 danger he says he has to find 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.760
 a solution to get out of there he 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 decides to give up his car and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.440
 go get help 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.930
 he walks he walks he walks and he 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.690
 starts to get dark it becomes 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.880
 really worried all his senses are 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.450
 woke up like never every brick he 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.190
 hear the food on the alert 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.319
 we go down to level 2 of the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.269
 pyramid 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.430
 then he realizes he does not have 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.889
 eaten since breakfast and that he 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.560
 hungry and thirsty 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.720
 we go down to level 1 two days 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.670
 after he is still at the same point 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.290
 with the difference that his thoughts are not going 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.690
 more than one thing find 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.709
 water and do not even care anymore about 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.450
 to eat because he knows instinctively 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.959
 that he can survive for weeks 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.940
 without food but not without water 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.870
 suddenly someone comes from behind he 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.060
 begins to choke 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950
 he can no longer breathe his need 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.410
 of air is now stronger than its 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.000
 need water his best friend was 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.430
 part of his research since he did not 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.200
 did not show up at darwin he did 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.030
 found the car and followed the road 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.120
 that his companion had certainly had 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.530
 borrow to save him in time what 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.169
 lessons can we withdraw from this 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.209
 story this story staged a 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.280
 nobody whose every need was 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.320
 fulfilled this man had made of his life 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.539
 a real success and really had 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.120
 turn your dream into reality 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.800
 but quickly 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.889
 a descent down the hierarchy of his 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.699
 needs his little concerns 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.350
 fly away in no time in 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.380
 comparison to the problems he must 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.210
 suddenly confront if we can not 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.030
 breathe we are not worried 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.199
 for water our priority and look so 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.790
 we can not find water 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.669
 we do not think about eating 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.229
 our priority and the water if we do not 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.419
 find no food we do not think 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.600
 not to find home we have to 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.370
 first eat to survive think about 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.330
 your reputation will not be great 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.770
 interest if you do not have a home 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.780
 that does not mean that unless we have 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.850
 no house and family we can 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.010
 have all this but simply that he 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.080
 must proceed in the order that means 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.419
 also that we should never 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.630
 take care of futile things or pass a 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.560
 phenomenal time to ruminate the past 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.840
 yet how many times have you 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.460
 think about unimportant things 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.250
 had built your own melodrama 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.289
 without looking at priorities in a 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.240
 recent study France appeared 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.660
 as the most depressed country in 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.660
 world 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.060
 and weirdly those who would worry 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.990
 the most are those who would be the best 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.300
 lotis why such a contradiction 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.639
 do we have too much time to think 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.110
 and so could be scared though the 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.599
 solution is simple it would be enough to be 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.419
 a little less selfish and to steer our 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.729
 thoughts in a more constructive way 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.630
 hold your greatest vision and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.630
 Believe in your dreams
