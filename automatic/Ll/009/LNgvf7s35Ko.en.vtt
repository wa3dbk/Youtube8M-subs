00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 and tonight I came to see four tails 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.610
 and a funeral an explosive combination 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.700
 let's see the note 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.700
 and with a little while 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.300
 it's like a tangle comedy genre 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.330
 and some magazine is a mosque 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.460
 is that actually if in fact the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.230
 genre is vaudeville what is called no 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.000
 when there are doors and entrances and exits 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.480
 permanent and entanglement is called vaudeville 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.360
 this we try not to break 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.400
 the fourth wall we try a little bit of 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.990
 complicity with this because one a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.360
 little bit of vice we always have to 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.790
 interrupts nothing exactly but 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.230
 we try not to be equal of all 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.890
 ways that people sell have fun 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.340
 that they put everything to nobody that they return 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.290
 the entry says so much to compose a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.690
 prostitutes character nothing more and nothing 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.759
 less tell me how good you encouraged 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.660
 how was the process good simply 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.660
 I remembered my past times promised if 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.140
 nothing good amused me, it amused me 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.060
 if not something 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 the doctor also has marcelo who 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.620
 has such a big house then 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.650
 we arrive at all times for the fee if 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.930
 I loved doing it and then go looking 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.210
 that yes yes it was that is what you see 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.390
 Now that is the one that admits that there 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.330
 you saw that thing like that language not much more 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.690
 if it will guard you bitch and ready a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.850
 tormenting a tormenting a degenerate 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.830
 material editor all that all together 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 we did something new let's say 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.759
 different from not doing season in or in 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.470
 the coast or in peace Carlos and stay 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.720
 here and I think it was the best choice 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.369
 we did because from the first day until 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.610
 today that this was going to end in March 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.410
 we are to april and we continue to follow is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.790
 free and we continue to follow that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.180
 Well, there are going to be a couple of changes 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.770
 a subject of previous commitments with the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.600
 theater and what do I know but well we're going to 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.830
 be doing tour around here in 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.780
 we also go to santa 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 fe-parana if God wants with many 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.130
 You also want to go after all the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.780
 country to do season also in the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.580
 many plans until May 6 and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.890
 then we do a month and a half month 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.569

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.900
 first weekend if we are going to do 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.330
 let's do a month and a half everything that is 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.980
 great Buenos Aires that after that there 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.470
 a chance to return to Buenos Aires 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.180
 to see if we want if God wants 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.489
 october idea to go to the sea of silver or 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.050
 Carlos Paz and next year make 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.760

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.250
 general from there we have that population 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.260
 general with many projects many a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.840

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.959

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.630
 a lot for that everyone so well I'm 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.550
 happy to be in this success now 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.800
 we 're going on tour so we're going to be 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.350
 reaching the places that there not no 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.110
 they have access to come good in 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.380
 consequence from success so very 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.840
 happy happy enjoying it and good 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.110
 learning a lot the guidelines he gives us 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.090
 the director studying to get there 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.769
 to be a great comedian you see them 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.390
 it served a lot between you of how 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.920
 a lot of complicity 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.010
 There's a lot of good vibes 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.160
 we are accomplices and there is also good 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.260
 energy and I think if you have fun and 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.099
 enjoy what the audience does too 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.410
 then we try to relax and 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.790
 have fun that is transmitted is not 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.340
 allow among you to improvise a 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.370
 little bit with the text I think it does appear 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.500
 and I am a time bomb like that and good 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.840
 and more and on the other hand he marcelo 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.930
 also and as long as with 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.530
 obviously with the criterion of the director 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.370
 that already overwhelmed but with things that 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.470
 good if they are natural they are giving 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.419
 spontaneous and they work and then the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.840
 we leave but what happens to Veronica with 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.840
 this office 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.479
 and that one that digita is removed but she like that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.250
 he wants it until good you saw 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:35.430
 the truth that he was not behaving 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.200
 nothing good with this one so it's the same 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.639
