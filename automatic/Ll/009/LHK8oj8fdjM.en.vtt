there's<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> concept<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.639> need<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.880> understand

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
there's a concept we need to understand

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
there's a concept we need to understand
is<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.599> difference<00:00:13.019> between<00:00:13.160> tight<00:00:14.160> muscles

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is the difference between tight muscles

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.720 
is the difference between tight muscles
and<00:00:14.969> short<00:00:15.839> muscles<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.470> muscle<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.430> tight

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and short muscles a muscle that's tight

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
and short muscles a muscle that's tight

what<00:00:53.340> will<00:00:53.460> happen<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.420> body<00:00:54.719> will

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
what will happen is my body will

muscle on this side and make that muscle

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
muscle on this side and make that muscle
shorter<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> says<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.489> need

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
shorter because it says I don't need

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.450 
shorter because it says I don't need
this<00:00:59.850> extra<00:01:00.090> length<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> muscle<00:01:01.250> if<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
this extra length in the muscle if I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.359 
this extra length in the muscle if I
want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> lengthen<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.420> muscle<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.080> is

shortened physically I have to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.560 
shortened physically I have to
physically<00:01:07.619> stretch<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.430> muscle<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.060> to

it to actually lengthen I need to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
it to actually lengthen I need to
stretch<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.900> 20<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> 30<00:01:13.740> minutes<00:01:14.130> that's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
stretch it for 20 to 30 minutes that's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
stretch it for 20 to 30 minutes that's
what<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> research<00:01:14.850> shows<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.110> few

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
what the research shows not just a few

what the research shows not just a few
seconds<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.830> 30<00:01:16.979> seconds<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.880> a

lot of times we're really not dealing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310 
lot of times we're really not dealing
with<00:01:20.430> physiological<00:01:21.270> shortness<00:01:21.750> unless<00:01:22.110> it's

a long-term adaptation to a problem

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
a long-term adaptation to a problem
we're<00:01:24.509> dealing<00:01:24.540> more<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.960> tightness<00:01:25.500> which

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we're dealing more with tightness which

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
we're dealing more with tightness which
is<00:01:26.100> more<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.460> neurological<00:01:27.150> issue<00:01:27.360> why<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is more of a neurological issue why is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
is more of a neurological issue why is
the<00:01:28.380> muscle<00:01:28.710> type<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> tight<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:29.610> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the muscle type is it tight because it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
the muscle type is it tight because it's

getting too much information coming in
is<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.549> tight<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.180> compensating

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
is it tight because it's compensating

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.130 
is it tight because it's compensating
for<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> problem<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.009> different<00:01:35.369> area<00:01:35.520> that

for a problem in a different area that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
for a problem in a different area that

in the clinic and we're looking at

in the clinic and we're looking at
somebody's<00:02:53.950> deltoid<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.849> we're<00:02:55.480> manually

testing that muscle in a test straw but

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.250 
testing that muscle in a test straw but
then<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:58.269> we<00:02:58.360> go<00:02:58.480> out<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.810> put<00:02:58.959> them<00:02:59.049> in<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
then when we go out and put them in a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.449 
then when we go out and put them in a
situation<00:02:59.739> when<00:02:59.860> they<00:02:59.920> have<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.130> use<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
situation when they have to use the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.460 
situation when they have to use the
muscle<00:03:00.790> such<00:03:01.209> as<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.390> side<00:03:01.630> lateral<00:03:02.049> raise<00:03:02.200> or

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
muscle such as a side lateral raise or

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.720 
muscle such as a side lateral raise or
an<00:03:02.590> overhead<00:03:02.799> bench<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:03.310> something<00:03:03.580> like<00:03:03.640> that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
an overhead bench or something like that

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670 
an overhead bench or something like that
and<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.450> muscle<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.840> actually<00:03:05.140> much<00:03:05.290> weaker

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and the muscle is actually much weaker

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and the muscle is actually much weaker
and<00:03:05.830> that's<00:03:05.950> because<00:03:06.190> there's<00:03:06.340> different

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
and that's because there's different

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.309 
and that's because there's different
neurological<00:03:06.940> input<00:03:07.569> to<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> system

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
neurological input to the system

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.990 
neurological input to the system
it's<00:03:08.560> altering<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.190> physiological<00:03:09.940> function

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it's altering the physiological function

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.570 
it's altering the physiological function
of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> muscle<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.260> doing<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.709> exercise<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
of the muscle so doing this exercise to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.430 
of the muscle so doing this exercise to
strengthen<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.180> isn't<00:03:13.900> really<00:03:14.109> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.320> do

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
strengthen it isn't really going to do

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.900 
strengthen it isn't really going to do
much<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.890> do<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.160> we<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.489> train<00:03:15.760> it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
much to do it we have to train it

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.090 
much to do it we have to train it
specific<00:03:16.750> like<00:03:16.900> we<00:03:17.049> talked<00:03:17.260> about<00:03:17.350> earlier<00:03:17.650> as

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
specific like we talked about earlier as

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.269 
specific like we talked about earlier as
