rear and look at how quickly the noble
swords<00:02:04.259> attacking<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.899> AutoZone<00:02:06.899> are

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
swords attacking the the AutoZone are

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.740 
swords attacking the the AutoZone are
able<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> take<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.039> down<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.149> complete

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
able to take them down just a complete

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.410 
able to take them down just a complete
Massacre<00:02:10.819> activating<00:02:11.819> head<00:02:11.940> home<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
Massacre activating head home to get a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
Massacre activating head home to get a
few<00:02:12.629> more<00:02:12.810> kills<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
few more kills in

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
few more kills in
and<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.130> ozone<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:14.610> dropping<00:02:14.820> super<00:02:15.210> quickly

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and the ozone are dropping super quickly

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.450 
and the ozone are dropping super quickly
keep<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.230> mind<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> slow<00:02:17.220> motion

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
keep in mind that this is in slow motion

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.150 
keep in mind that this is in slow motion
so<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.720> ozone<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.440> dying<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.830> actually

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so the ozone that are dying are actually

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.860 
so the ozone that are dying are actually
dying<00:02:20.430> much<00:02:20.640> quicker<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.330> Hobbiton<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
dying much quicker will Hobbiton a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.560 
dying much quicker will Hobbiton a
normal<00:02:22.290> speed<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.820> already<00:02:23.820> down<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> 65

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
normal speed here already down to 65

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.050 
normal speed here already down to 65
ma'am<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.530> unfortunately<00:02:26.340> forgets<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.030> a

horse<00:02:27.300> comes<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.780> here<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> stops<00:02:28.410> these<00:02:28.710> two

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
horse comes in here and stops these two

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.120 
horse comes in here and stops these two
units<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.400> -<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.790> harrybo's<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.720> just

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
units of - and harrybo's so this is just

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.720 
units of - and harrybo's so this is just
not<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> good<00:02:35.490> time<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.940> these<00:02:36.060> oats<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.990> but<00:02:37.730> as

swords very easily if it wasn't for the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.100 
swords very easily if it wasn't for the
energy<00:03:08.160> move<00:03:08.370> about<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:08.970> they<00:03:09.930> thought

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
energy move about there so they thought

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.470 
energy move about there so they thought
was<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> very<00:03:10.410> nice<00:03:10.830> move<00:03:11.360> unfortunate<00:03:12.360> that

was a very nice move unfortunate that

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.810 
was a very nice move unfortunate that
