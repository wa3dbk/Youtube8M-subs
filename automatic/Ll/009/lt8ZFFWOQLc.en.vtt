to look for it these little valves right

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
to look for it these little valves right
and<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> loosen<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:35.790> a

little bit so once that's loosened go
over<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:51.120> find<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> water<00:00:53.039> line<00:00:53.340> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
over and you find the water line that

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.279 
over and you find the water line that
exits<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.390> house<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> sprinkler

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
exits your house for the sprinkler

exits your house for the sprinkler
system<00:00:55.370> what<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
system what you do is you take up the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.180 
system what you do is you take up the
cap<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:59.730> attach<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.420> air<00:01:01.320> hose<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
cap and you attach an air hose it has a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
cap and you attach an air hose it has a
barb<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> end<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> mine's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
barb at the end which is mine's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.859 
barb at the end which is mine's
half-inch<00:01:04.680> screws<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
half-inch screws right into it so it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
half-inch screws right into it so it
kind<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> looks<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.400> one's<00:01:08.670> for

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
kind of looks like this this one's for

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.980 
kind of looks like this this one's for
3/8<00:01:09.390> hose<00:01:09.659> size<00:01:10.350> 3/8<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.479> half-inch

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
3/8 hose size 3/8 and this is half-inch

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.399 
3/8 hose size 3/8 and this is half-inch
screws<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:15.000> should<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.420> Oldham

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
screws right in they should be Oldham

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.240 
screws right in they should be Oldham
should<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.710> standards<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.950> once<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
should be standards so once you have

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.660 
should be standards so once you have
that<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:21.590> over<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> your<00:01:22.950> compressor

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.910 

and<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.630> have<00:01:28.810> my<00:01:28.930> compressor<00:01:29.440> plugged<00:01:29.740> in

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
and I have my compressor plugged in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.320 
and I have my compressor plugged in
already<00:01:30.690> what<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.720> do<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.880> connect<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
already what you do is you connect the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.520 
already what you do is you connect the
hose<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:41.430> you'll<00:01:42.430> see<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:44.050> sprinkler

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
hose and you'll see the sprinkler

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
hose and you'll see the sprinkler
systems<00:01:45.070> will<00:01:46.000> turn<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:46.479> as<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.500> can<00:01:47.680> see

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
systems will turn on as you can see

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.990 
systems will turn on as you can see
right<00:01:49.479> now<00:01:49.540> it's<00:01:49.900> blown<00:01:50.229> out<00:01:50.470> all<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.729> water

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
right now it's blown out all the water

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.640 
right now it's blown out all the water
right<00:01:52.270> now<00:01:52.450> now<00:01:53.110> you're<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.409> want<00:01:53.560> to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
right now now you're going to want to

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.460 
right now now you're going to want to
wait<00:01:53.830> until<00:01:54.119> nothing<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.450> air<00:01:55.720> comes<00:01:56.170> out<00:01:56.320> of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
wait until nothing but air comes out of

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:17.390 
wait until nothing but air comes out of
the<00:01:56.560> system

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.650 

that's<00:02:18.400> about<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:21.310> could<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.300> make

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
that's about it we could do just to make

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.080 
that's about it we could do just to make
sure<00:02:22.690> all<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.410> waters<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.819> unplug

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sure all the waters out you can unplug

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.420 
sure all the waters out you can unplug
the<00:02:25.300> hose<00:02:25.480> from<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> compressor<00:02:26.380> let<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the hose from the compressor let the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
the hose from the compressor let the
compressor<00:02:27.910> boot<00:02:28.120> up<00:02:28.270> again<00:02:28.569> get<00:02:28.720> enough<00:02:28.959> air

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
compressor boot up again get enough air

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.949 
compressor boot up again get enough air
pressure<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.709> do<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.160> process<00:02:30.580> over<00:02:30.959> each

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
pressure and do the process over each

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.870 
pressure and do the process over each
zone<00:02:32.260> that's<00:02:32.470> all<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.709> do<00:02:32.770> just<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.370> double<00:02:33.670> check

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
zone that's all I do just a double check

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.830 
zone that's all I do just a double check
and<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:34.989> once<00:02:35.260> that's<00:02:35.440> uh<00:02:35.910> once<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.120> only

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
and then once that's uh once you only

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
and then once that's uh once you only
air<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.350> coming<00:02:38.620> out<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.450> sprinkler<00:02:40.450> head

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
air is coming out of the sprinkler head

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.020 
air is coming out of the sprinkler head
you<00:02:42.730> walk<00:02:42.940> back<00:02:43.150> over<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.830> your<00:02:45.010> panel<00:02:45.400> your

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you walk back over so your panel your

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.670 
you walk back over so your panel your
ear<00:02:46.239> irrigation<00:02:46.959> control<00:02:47.440> panel<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> the
