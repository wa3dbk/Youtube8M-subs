00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 the brush I use is Tiger 151 for 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 central paint gives to paint for rain 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 to try anything is this brush 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:29.310
 just okay for you as I learn today is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:34.130
 paper card you fold in double 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.140
 These pieces and folds pull well 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.540
 undertakes with vita crepe 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.540
 the most you can close 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.460
 bye 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.720
 done that my test is already scratched 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:22.060
 I can start playing 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:24.840
 the technique I used is smoky then 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's the beginning 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:39.070
 the use is if it's brown 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.479
 So I'll get the first one if she's together. 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.500
 with him six in 11 fiddle with the brush and 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.399
 nothing until the brown where I want to choose 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.399
 I already play 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:08.050
 To do and ear I'm going to use a 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.050
 little red with brown 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:28.820
 first I come where I want and then 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:43.010
 I carry this paint into the middle of the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:52.670
 ear to ear of paint on the outside and 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:54.320
 carry on the risk does not need 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.740
 deep well 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.910
 nothing is everything direct 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.280
 Look, I'll choose to be and come 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.820
 pulling whatever ink I have on my 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.480
 brush I use when I'm done I'll just get 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.480
 a little more 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:16.870
 within 10 or I did the same as I did 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.870
 I made to the other party 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:31.139
 this way the face of my little bear 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:33.779
 Okay, I'll do the nose I 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.509
 now tick on mine if you do not know 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.869
 you can draw 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:44.059
 Before I did not draw, I'll go 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:44.059
 mark my looking looks 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:43.340
 in the eye I have to put the shine 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.760
 of the games and we won a little bit of 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:55.550
 white look and gift 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:58.510
 a light contour puts the shine find 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.510
 france and a half 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:27.710
 to make mouthwash in use was a 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:31.130
 other animal you use the color of the animal more 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:35.410
 red then my case I'm going to use siena 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.410
 with a little bit of red 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:49.640
 I do not look pure red because otherwise 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:52.000
 It's very lucky it puts the sparkle in my 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.000
 face
