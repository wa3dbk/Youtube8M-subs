running<00:00:06.270> yesterday<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.960> tried<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.440> make<00:00:07.589> a

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
running yesterday I tried to make a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.629 
running yesterday I tried to make a
video<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.370> got<00:00:08.580> cut<00:00:08.790> off

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
video of it and it got cut off

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.670 
video of it and it got cut off
YouTube<00:00:11.639> me<00:00:13.370> this<00:00:14.370> engine<00:00:14.790> well<00:00:15.260> this<00:00:16.260> screen

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
YouTube me this engine well this screen

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.010 
YouTube me this engine well this screen
got<00:00:16.859> then<00:00:17.100> upon<00:00:17.430> me<00:00:17.640> wishes<00:00:18.000> heading<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.390> pop

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
got then upon me wishes heading up pop

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
got then upon me wishes heading up pop
it<00:00:19.199> back<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.529> out<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:21.060> c-clip

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
it back at out it's got a little c-clip

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.710 
it back at out it's got a little c-clip
thing<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:21.930> holds<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:23.420> spring<00:00:24.420> clip

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
thing here holds it in spring clip

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
thing here holds it in spring clip
rather<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.740> don't<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> generator<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
rather I don't think the generator is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
rather I don't think the generator is
charging<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> engine<00:00:29.429> does<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.670> run<00:00:30.119> off

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
charging but the engine does not run off

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.840 
charging but the engine does not run off
of<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.929> creates<00:00:31.470> its<00:00:31.590> own<00:00:31.710> spark<00:00:32.099> using<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
of it it creates its own spark using a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.600 
of it it creates its own spark using a
magneto<00:00:33.450> behind<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> flywheel<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:37.610> put

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
magneto behind the flywheel I put

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.770 
magneto behind the flywheel I put
another<00:00:38.790> spark<00:00:39.120> plug<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> yesterday

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
another spark plug in it yesterday

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
another spark plug in it yesterday
because<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.649> engine<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because this engine has a little bit of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.049 
because this engine has a little bit of
a<00:00:41.640> problem

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a problem

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.639 
a problem
besides<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> guns<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.290> sticky

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
besides the guns are a little sticky

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
besides the guns are a little sticky
because<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:47.450> doesn't<00:00:48.450> spring

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because you can see it's doesn't spring

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
because you can see it's doesn't spring
back<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.590> good<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> should<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.610> warms

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
back as good as it should until it warms

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.840 
back as good as it should until it warms
up<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.800> don't<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.949> why<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.190> does<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> once

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
up I don't know why it does that once

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.580 
up I don't know why it does that once
the<00:00:54.000> engine<00:00:54.239> warms<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> works<00:00:54.960> fine<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
the engine warms up it works fine the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.110 
the engine warms up it works fine the
choke<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> missing<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> detent<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.730> holds

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
choke is missing the detent which holds

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
choke is missing the detent which holds
it<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.300> position<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.500> flops

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it in position so it just kind of flops

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.030 
it in position so it just kind of flops
around<00:01:01.980> wherever<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> feels<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:03.920> that's<00:01:04.920> why

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
around wherever it feels like that's why

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.840 
around wherever it feels like that's why
the<00:01:05.100> vise<00:01:05.280> grips<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.549> it<00:01:08.549> has<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the vise grips are there and it has a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.179 
the vise grips are there and it has a
dipstick<00:01:09.299> which<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:12.799> we<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:14.040> got

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
dipstick which I like we still got

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.429 
dipstick which I like we still got
plenty<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.640> oil<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> run<00:01:15.210> safely<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.990> just

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
plenty of oil to run safely so I just

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
plenty of oil to run safely so I just
have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> run<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:22.890> my<00:01:23.040> booster<00:01:23.430> pack<00:01:23.610> right

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
have to run off my booster pack right

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
have to run off my booster pack right
now<00:01:24.680> flip<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.920> switch<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:27.170> turn<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:30.470> I'm

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
now flip this switch up turn on I'm

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
now flip this switch up turn on I'm
gonna<00:01:31.650> set<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.040> camera<00:01:32.329> huge<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.689> then

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
gonna set this camera huge and then

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:48.690 
gonna set this camera huge and then
choke<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.979> push<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:38.970> button

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:06.120 

that's<00:01:49.700> how<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:49.910> leave<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.360> little<00:01:50.630> guy<00:01:50.810> up

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.410 

but<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> carburetor<00:02:07.610> doesn't<00:02:08.030> leak<00:02:08.149> or

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
but the carburetor doesn't leak or

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.270 
but the carburetor doesn't leak or
anything<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.259> problem<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.710> have<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:09.979> this

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
anything the problem I have is this

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.880 
anything the problem I have is this
engine<00:02:10.960> it's<00:02:11.960> once<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.380> get<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> nice<00:02:12.830> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
engine it's once you get it nice and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.100 
engine it's once you get it nice and
warm<00:02:13.310> once<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.820> get<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.060> hot<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.720> shut<00:02:14.990> it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
warm once you get it hot and you shut it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.730 
warm once you get it hot and you shut it
off<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:16.280> don't<00:02:16.460> start<00:02:17.170> not<00:02:18.170> until<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.500> cooled

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
off it don't start not until it cooled

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:37.660 
off it don't start not until it cooled
down<00:02:18.830> again<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:20.630> now<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.170> still<00:02:21.470> cool

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.490 

but<00:02:38.670> once<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.180> gets<00:02:39.329> hot<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.750> will<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.200> crank

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
but once it gets hot it will just crank

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.709 
but once it gets hot it will just crank
and<00:02:40.709> crank<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.219> crank<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.730> crank<00:02:41.790> crank<00:02:42.359> and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
and crank and crank it crank crank and

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.220 
and crank and crank it crank crank and
crank<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.200> crank<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.709> not<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.040> anything<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.790> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
crank and crank and not do anything so I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.959 
crank and crank and not do anything so I
don't<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.379> got<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> figure<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:46.920> out<00:02:47.099> and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
don't know I got to figure that out and

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.369 
don't know I got to figure that out and
I've<00:02:48.269> still<00:02:48.659> yet<00:02:48.689> to<00:02:48.959> see<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> other

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
I've still yet to see it from the other

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.849 
I've still yet to see it from the other
k91<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.489> got<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.000> one<00:02:51.209> runs<00:02:51.420> I

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
k91 that I got with this one runs I

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.380 
k91 that I got with this one runs I
gotta<00:02:52.859> fix<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.280> points<00:02:54.439> and<00:02:55.849> the<00:02:56.849> starter<00:02:57.180> Cup

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
gotta fix the points and the starter Cup
