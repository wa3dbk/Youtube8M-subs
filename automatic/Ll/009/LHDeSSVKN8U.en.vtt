00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
go okay we're going to do that what I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
go okay we're going to do that what I
suggest<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.780> times<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.200> want<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> reach

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
suggest a lot of times I want to reach

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
suggest a lot of times I want to reach
for<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> salt<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.369> throw<00:01:08.880> salt<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.299> there

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
for the salt and throw salt on there

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.770 
for the salt and throw salt on there
there's<00:01:10.530> probably<00:01:10.799> enough<00:01:11.400> sodium<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:12.150> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there's probably enough sodium in this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's probably enough sodium in this
soup<00:01:12.990> mix<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.770> need<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
soup mix that we don't need to do that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
soup mix that we don't need to do that
