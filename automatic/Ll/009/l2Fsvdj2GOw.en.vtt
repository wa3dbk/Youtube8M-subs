00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
I don't think I'm going to agree with it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.740

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
but you you feel that way yeah I think

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.540 
but you you feel that way yeah I think
it<00:01:11.050> is<00:01:11.080> murder<00:01:11.680> though<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.160> might<00:01:12.340> be

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
it is murder though it might be

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.690 
it is murder though it might be
second-degree<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.840> in<00:01:14.050> many<00:01:14.260> cases<00:01:14.800> but<00:01:15.370> I

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
second-degree and in many cases but I

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.390 
second-degree and in many cases but I
realize<00:01:16.150> it's<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.540> very<00:01:16.570> difficult<00:01:17.230> issue<00:01:17.680> and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
I have called this in my own writings a

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.370 
I have called this in my own writings a
future<00:02:26.769> of<00:02:26.890> value

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
future of value

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.490 
future of value
if<00:02:28.970> denying<00:02:29.970> somebody<00:02:30.690> their<00:02:30.960> future<00:02:31.350> of

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
if denying somebody their future of

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650 
if denying somebody their future of
value<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.070> what<00:02:32.250> makes<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.610> long<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.000> kill<00:02:33.210> them

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
value is what makes it long to kill them

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.130 
value is what makes it long to kill them
and<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.100> because<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and this is because we think that the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.500 
and this is because we think that the
misfortune<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.860> death<00:02:38.100> for<00:02:38.490> them<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.210> denial

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
misfortune of death for them is a denial

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.170 
misfortune of death for them is a denial
of<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.050> future<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.530> value<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.610> fetuses<00:02:42.150> have

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
of the future of value then fetuses have

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.220 
of the future of value then fetuses have
futures<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.900> value<00:02:43.200> also<00:02:43.730> because<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
futures of value also because the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
futures of value also because the
fetuses<00:02:46.860> future<00:02:47.430> will<00:02:47.700> contain<00:02:48.060> everything

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
fetuses future will contain everything

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.080 
fetuses future will contain everything
that<00:02:48.930> Michaels<00:02:49.500> future<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.100> future<00:02:50.670> my

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
that Michaels future in my future my

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.150 
that Michaels future in my future my
future<00:02:51.330> contain<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.590> great<00:02:52.770> deal<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> our

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
future contain and a great deal of our

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.600 
future contain and a great deal of our
past

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
past

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.860 
past
-<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:55.490> fetuses<00:02:56.490> have<00:02:56.520> futures<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.180> ours<00:02:57.630> and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
- so fetuses have futures like ours and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.960 
- so fetuses have futures like ours and
since<00:02:58.260> been<00:02:58.500> having<00:02:59.040> being<00:02:59.400> denied<00:02:59.700> one's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.890 
since been having being denied one's
future<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:02.780> what<00:03:03.780> makes<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.170> wrong<00:03:04.350> kill<00:03:04.710> us

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
future is what makes it wrong kill us
