00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.820 
din and that's DLNA compliant I haven't
used<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.369> device<00:00:54.760> before<00:00:55.080> though<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.650> my

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
used this device before though to my

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.130 
used this device before though to my
understanding<00:00:57.070> it's<00:00:57.939> only<00:00:58.299> compatible<00:00:58.659> with

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
understanding it's only compatible with

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.060 
understanding it's only compatible with
HTC<00:00:59.979> devices<00:01:00.689> so<00:01:01.689> it<00:01:02.019> will<00:01:02.260> be<00:01:02.290> compatible

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
HTC devices so it will be compatible

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.810 
HTC devices so it will be compatible
with<00:01:03.100> devices<00:01:03.879> such<00:01:04.089> as<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.479> HTC<00:01:05.400> One<00:01:06.400> series

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
with devices such as the HTC One series

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.210 
with devices such as the HTC One series
so<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.420> will<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.600> compatible<00:01:08.290> with<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.439> HTC

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
so it will be compatible with the HTC

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.560 
so it will be compatible with the HTC
One<00:01:09.580> X<00:01:09.880> 1<00:01:10.299> s<00:01:10.570> 1<00:01:10.600> V<00:01:11.259> is<00:01:11.950> probably<00:01:12.789> compatible

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
One X 1 s 1 V is probably compatible

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.749 
One X 1 s 1 V is probably compatible
with<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.780> sensation<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.950> know<00:01:15.070> sensation

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
with the sensation you know sensation

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.529 
with the sensation you know sensation
exceeds<00:01:16.210> sensation<00:01:16.869> Excel<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.909> hoping<00:01:19.179> that

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
exceeds sensation Excel I'm hoping that

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.849 
exceeds sensation Excel I'm hoping that
it's<00:01:19.689> compatible<00:01:20.049> with<00:01:20.320> my<00:01:20.619> HTC<00:01:21.520> velocity<00:01:22.210> 4g

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.649 

okay<00:01:26.859> so<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.460> basically<00:01:27.609> have<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.329> smaller

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
okay so we basically have the smaller

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.169 
okay so we basically have the smaller
device<00:01:29.049> here<00:01:29.499> if<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.130> can<00:01:30.310> get<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.549> out<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.909> the

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
device here if I can get it out of the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.380 
device here if I can get it out of the
packaging<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:33.159> absolutely<00:01:33.340> smaller<00:01:33.969> device

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
packaging it's absolutely smaller device

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.529 
packaging it's absolutely smaller device
it's<00:01:34.749> got<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.990> HTC<00:01:35.170> logo<00:01:35.829> on<00:01:36.219> it<00:01:37.030> appears<00:01:37.450> to

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
it's got the HTC logo on it appears to

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.410 
it's got the HTC logo on it appears to
have<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.840> hdmi<00:01:38.499> port<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.759> micro<00:01:40.299> USB<00:01:40.329> port

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
have a hdmi port and a micro USB port

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.999 
have a hdmi port and a micro USB port
and<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.749> doesn't<00:01:44.049> appear<00:01:44.319> to<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.530> any<00:01:44.679> other

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
and it doesn't appear to have any other

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.679 
and it doesn't appear to have any other
ports<00:01:45.429> on<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:45.999> appears<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.509> have<00:01:46.630> a

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
ports on it and it appears to have a

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.440 
ports on it and it appears to have a
button<00:01:47.109> at<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.289> top<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.179> if<00:01:49.179> you<00:01:49.420> can

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
button at the top of it there if you can

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.539 
button at the top of it there if you can
see<00:01:49.600> it<00:01:49.780> see<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.289> as<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.439> button<00:01:50.740> there<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.369> two

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
see it see it as a button there the two

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.179 
see it see it as a button there the two
ports<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.210> bottom<00:01:52.499> so<00:01:53.499> obviously<00:01:54.009> you

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
ports on the bottom so obviously you

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.690 
ports on the bottom so obviously you
connect<00:01:54.520> your<00:01:54.639> TV<00:01:55.119> via<00:01:55.149> hdmi<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:57.310> micro

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
connect your TV via hdmi and the micro

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.940 
connect your TV via hdmi and the micro
USB<00:01:58.210> port<00:01:58.240> would<00:01:58.719> be<00:01:58.840> used<00:01:59.109> for<00:01:59.409> charging<00:01:59.439> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
USB port would be used for charging the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.039 
USB port would be used for charging the
device<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.429> that's<00:02:00.909> probably<00:02:01.090> just<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.780> turn

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
device and that's probably just to turn

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.919 
device and that's probably just to turn
it<00:02:02.200> on<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.530> off<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.889> that<00:02:03.009> button<00:02:03.429> up<00:02:03.549> resume

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
it on and off of that button up resume

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.600 
it on and off of that button up resume
now<00:02:04.929> let's<00:02:05.259> see<00:02:05.499> what<00:02:05.679> else<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:06.100> in<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.399> box

believe<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.650> only<00:03:58.830> use<00:03:59.040> these

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
believe that you can only use these

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.880 
believe that you can only use these
instructions<00:04:00.360> on<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.720> One<00:04:00.900> X<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.530> probably

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
instructions on the One X and probably

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.640 
instructions on the One X and probably
the<00:04:02.100> 1s<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.880> 1v<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.470> basically

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
the 1s and the 1v so it's basically

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.610 
the 1s and the 1v so it's basically
saying<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.760> need<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.209> swipe<00:04:06.620> three
