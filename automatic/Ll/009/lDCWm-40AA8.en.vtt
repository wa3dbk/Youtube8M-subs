00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.470
 Around the foot 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.950
 Of these, the prefecture is introduced in the Maeda section 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.729
 I look forward to myself clockwise 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.949
 There are many other variations 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.949
 At first we start bath with foot on the ground 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.419
 In order to keep your right foot in front and not get on the story 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.179
 Move and turn the ball 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.519
 You can also wait for Mario at your feet, not your alma mater 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.519
 It is good with theonput 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.110
 Go around by turns around meteorites 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.740
 At first we left the left foot 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.720
 Direct your body completely into the season 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.480
 I use my left hand grip well 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.630
 I waited alternately around 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.980
 So I'm going to make the final decision 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.940
 I will try to kick the clear ball 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 It is not old 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.390
 Those who overthrow a bridge or runway on the bridge 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 The way to speak from right to left is the point 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.480
 Because the effect of improvement goes lower than I thought 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 Let's try to bounce back to the top 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.600
 It is also possible to turn around the matter and reverse by saying reverse. 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.530
 Such a feeling when combining tennis and reverse 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 is 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.990
 When you are in the footsteps or under a blogger 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.120
 It is difficult to put the hand to the right 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
 Only one hand can turn around the leg 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.630
 I kept the rotation in motion 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.310
 You can also turn the lower part that you put out behind 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.329
 Lightly throw up and bring a ball to the back of your back 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 It's fun but it turns around the teeth 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.810
 Harada vs 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.110
 I was forced around 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.220
 Develop variously with the unique patterns of many players 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.650
 It has been 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650
 Stop with your right hand from the front of your right foot 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.770
 I told you to cover it with the left hand from above 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 Start the right foot software once to identify your body 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.289
 Update again 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.289
 I will return to your visit 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:20.899
 Second lot 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.479
 Also from around the right foot 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.739
 Run from behind behind the release schedule at the same time 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.499
 I will pay while using 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.609
 Continue the process that has been centered on the right foot as it is tied to the left foot side 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.599
 I will return to the original and finish
