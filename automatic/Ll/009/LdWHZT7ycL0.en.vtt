00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
know I didn't think beyond this the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759

neighborhood what do you do about the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.160 
neighborhood what do you do about the
guilt<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.220> comes<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.929> always

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
guilt that comes with it like I always

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.350 
guilt that comes with it like I always
feel<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.500> oh<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.769> better<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.180> do

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
feel like oh I better I don't know do

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
feel like oh I better I don't know do
something<00:00:33.600> else<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.410> feel<00:00:34.980> panicked<00:00:35.399> about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
something else or I feel panicked about

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 
something else or I feel panicked about
it<00:00:35.730> sometimes<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.719> guilt<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it sometimes I think guilt is just a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
it sometimes I think guilt is just a
complete<00:00:37.800> waste<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> energy<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.760> mean<00:00:39.030> well

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
complete waste of energy I mean well

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
complete waste of energy I mean well
what<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.809> condition<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> though

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
what if your condition with it though

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.840 
what if your condition with it though
like<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.980> always<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.610> happy

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
like I always think if I'm too happy

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.950 
like I always think if I'm too happy
I'll<00:00:42.030> go<00:00:42.120> outside<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.510> hit<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> bus

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I'll go outside and get hit by a bus

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 
I'll go outside and get hit by a bus
yeah<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> the

yeah you know but that's one of the
things<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.050> we're<00:00:46.590> trained<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
things that we're trained to do is that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
things that we're trained to do is that
we're<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.059> trained<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.629> content<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
trained to believe that we're entitled

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
trained to believe that we're entitled
to<00:00:50.760> happiness<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.390> weren't<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:52.110> were

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
to happiness that weren't that were

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
to happiness that weren't that were

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
know that there's sort of like mind

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
know that there's sort of like mind
viruses<00:00:58.530> they're<00:00:58.710> handed<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> us<00:00:59.190> when<00:00:59.460> we're

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
viruses they're handed to us when we're

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.740 
viruses they're handed to us when we're
just<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:00:59.879> child<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.600> like

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
ideas their thoughts and the fact is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
ideas their thoughts and the fact is
that<00:01:28.560> none<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.520> true<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.270> know

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that none of them are true you know

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.490 
that none of them are true you know
they're<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.689> things<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.110> carry<00:01:31.409> around

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
they're just things that we carry around
