minutes<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.619> probably<00:00:25.980> already<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
minutes you probably already know this

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.750 
minutes you probably already know this
method<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.990> getting<00:00:28.560> adamant<00:00:29.369> bars

method but that is getting adamant bars
from<00:00:30.449> avian<00:00:30.929> Seas<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.710> believe<00:00:32.009> that's

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
from avian Seas which I believe that's

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.299 
from avian Seas which I believe that's
how<00:00:32.520> everything<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.480> pronounced<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.050> so

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309

they go for anywhere from 25 to about 35
k<00:01:02.180> each<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.070> figure<00:01:04.370> all<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.580> up<00:01:04.940> here

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
k each so if you figure all that up here

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.300 
k each so if you figure all that up here
I'm<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.750> open<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.140> calculator<00:01:06.650> up<00:01:06.890> here

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
I'm going to open a calculator up here

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.060 
I'm going to open a calculator up here
we<00:01:07.400> go<00:01:07.550> calculator<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.840> if<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.620> figure<00:01:09.950> you

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
we go calculator so if you figure you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.920 
we go calculator so if you figure you
get<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> thousand<00:01:10.850> per<00:01:10.970> 15<00:01:11.330> minutes<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:11.780> you

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
get a thousand per 15 minutes then you

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.390 
get a thousand per 15 minutes then you
get<00:01:12.080> 4,000<00:01:12.890> per<00:01:13.600> hour<00:01:14.600> right<00:01:15.020> there<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.380> go<00:01:15.500> x

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
get 4,000 per hour right there you go x

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.860 
get 4,000 per hour right there you go x
anywhere<00:01:17.270> from<00:01:17.540> 25<00:01:18.140> k<00:01:19.240> i'm<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.540> going<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.690> do

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
anywhere from 25 k i'm just going to do

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.310 
anywhere from 25 k i'm just going to do
25<00:01:21.290> k<00:01:21.500> at<00:01:21.590> first<00:01:21.800> then<00:01:22.370> you<00:01:22.400> have<00:01:22.760> one<00:01:23.330> that's<00:01:23.630> a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
25 k at first then you have one that's a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.000 
25 k at first then you have one that's a
hundred<00:01:24.530> mil<00:01:25.180> that's<00:01:26.180> 100<00:01:26.900> mil<00:01:27.110> per<00:01:27.410> hour<00:01:27.619> if

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
hundred mil that's 100 mil per hour if

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.150 
hundred mil that's 100 mil per hour if
you<00:01:28.910> can<00:01:29.180> actually<00:01:30.110> sell<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> adamant<00:01:30.800> bars<00:01:30.979> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.340 
you can actually sell the adamant bars I
don't<00:01:31.340> know<00:01:31.430> how<00:01:31.580> quickly<00:01:31.880> they<00:01:32.150> sell<00:01:32.420> or<00:01:32.690> if

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
don't know how quickly they sell or if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.719 
don't know how quickly they sell or if
they'll<00:01:33.530> actually<00:01:33.710> sell<00:01:34.190> but<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.610> make

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
they'll actually sell but you can make

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.340 
they'll actually sell but you can make
anywhere<00:01:35.180> from<00:01:35.240> 100<00:01:36.229> mil<00:01:36.410> to<00:01:37.630> probably<00:01:38.630> 150

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
anywhere from 100 mil to probably 150

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.590 
anywhere from 100 mil to probably 150
mil<00:01:39.770> depending<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.550> how<00:01:41.119> much<00:01:41.360> you're<00:01:41.540> selling

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
mil depending on how much you're selling

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.180 
mil depending on how much you're selling
for<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.260> how<00:01:42.350> long<00:01:42.500> you're<00:01:42.710> willing<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.040> wait

for<00:01:43.490> those<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.850> sell<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.450> I'm<00:01:44.990> actually<00:01:45.140> going

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
for those to sell so I'm actually going

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.790 
for those to sell so I'm actually going
to<00:01:45.530> put<00:01:45.650> these<00:01:45.800> in<00:01:45.979> for<00:01:46.310> 25<00:01:46.760> mil<00:01:47.060> right<00:01:47.270> now<00:01:47.479> and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
to put these in for 25 mil right now and

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.440 
to put these in for 25 mil right now and
I'm<00:01:48.800> going<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.400> see<00:01:49.729> how<00:01:49.820> long<00:01:49.880> they<00:01:50.180> take<00:01:50.210> to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
I'm going to see how long they take to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.570 
I'm going to see how long they take to
sell<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.080> if<00:01:51.170> they<00:01:51.380> sell<00:01:51.770> fairly<00:01:52.369> quickly

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
sell and if they sell fairly quickly

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.130 
sell and if they sell fairly quickly
then<00:01:52.910> i<00:01:53.000> might<00:01:53.149> add<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.509> in<00:01:53.630> at<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.840> end<00:01:54.020> of

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
then i might add it in at the end of

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.660 
then i might add it in at the end of
this<00:01:54.229> video<00:01:54.410> if<00:01:54.800> not<00:01:55.009> then<00:01:55.250> i'm<00:01:55.369> just<00:01:55.399> going<00:01:55.610> to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
this video if not then i'm just going to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.570

go<00:01:55.759> ahead<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.090> close<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:56.780> video<00:01:57.229> off<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.770> i

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
go ahead and close this video off and i

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.370

come<00:05:09.540> south<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:09.870> then<00:05:10.200> grapple<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.710> pillow

come south and then grapple the pillow
right<00:05:11.160> there<00:05:11.400> just<00:05:11.610> like<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:11.910> did<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.610> as<00:05:14.940> you

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
right there just like I did so as you

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.210 
right there just like I did so as you
can<00:05:15.210> see<00:05:15.480> there's<00:05:15.810> quite<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.080> few<00:05:16.170> people<00:05:16.860> here

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
can see there's quite a few people here

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.370 
can see there's quite a few people here
but<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.580> never<00:05:18.210> really<00:05:18.270> gets<00:05:18.660> like<00:05:18.900> extremely

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
but it never really gets like extremely

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.770 
but it never really gets like extremely
crowded<00:05:19.740> usually<00:05:20.700> what<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:20.880> use<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.360> soulsplit

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
crowded usually what I use is soulsplit

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.820 
crowded usually what I use is soulsplit
and<00:05:22.260> then<00:05:23.270> turmoil<00:05:24.270> just<00:05:24.540> for<00:05:24.750> defense<00:05:25.410> bonus

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.030 
and then turmoil just for defense bonus
but<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.250> guess<00:05:26.580> that's<00:05:26.610> not<00:05:27.000> really<00:05:27.060> necessary

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
but I guess that's not really necessary

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
longer than I thought and it probably

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.330 
longer than I thought and it probably
wasn't<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.000> best<00:06:18.560> structured<00:06:19.560> video<00:06:19.890> you've

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
could have done better obviously I know

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.440 
could have done better obviously I know
that<00:06:28.050> it<00:06:28.140> wasn't<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.500> best<00:06:29.030> layout<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.240> stuff

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
like probably could have structured it

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.700 
like probably could have structured it
better<00:06:32.250> and<00:06:32.520> time<00:06:32.880> things<00:06:33.240> at<00:06:33.450> better<00:06:34.170> places
