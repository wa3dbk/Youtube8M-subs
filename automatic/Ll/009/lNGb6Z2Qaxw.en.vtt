 you and well I will tell you 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 I started in 2012 opening a channel with 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.159
 the dream of sharing with more people 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.839
 about this from the world of android 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.720
 news personalization applications 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.210
 reviews etcetera and well I did not think that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.920
 will reach such an audience when I 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.070
 I completed my first year I reached six thousand 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.530
 subscribers and well my channel has passed 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.150
 many adventures and misadventures to 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.860
 beginning there was a time where I was 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.250
 uploading some videos to the channel 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.989
 mehsud or that they were called Wednesday 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.479
 of Android be attentive because 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.040
 soon there may be a Wednesday of 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.590

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.390

 6000 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.000
 and a crazy idea came to my mind and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 I said for the next year when it meets 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.940
 two years of the channel I have to reach 50 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.010
 thousand subscribers were 44 thousand 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 subscribers if in a year I had done 6 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.390

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.090
