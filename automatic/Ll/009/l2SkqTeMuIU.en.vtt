down what I have here so general
settings<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:58.469> believe<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
settings I don't believe you're going to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
settings I don't believe you're going to
be<00:00:59.039> changing<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> general<00:01:00.359> settings

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be changing much in the general settings

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
be changing much in the general settings
but<00:01:00.989> again<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.859> sure<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
but again just do make sure you have the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
but again just do make sure you have the
same<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.730> that's<00:01:02.879> set<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.510> spawn

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
same thing that's set up there spawn

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.780 
same thing that's set up there spawn
setting<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> only<00:01:05.100> thing<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.430> gonna<00:01:05.549> want

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
setting the only thing you're gonna want

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
setting the only thing you're gonna want
to<00:01:05.850> change<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.689> believe<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.740> very

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to change here I believe is the very

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
to change here I believe is the very
bottom<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.430> they're<00:01:08.640> team<00:01:08.909> kill<00:01:09.180> penalty<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
bottom one they're team kill penalty and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000 
bottom one they're team kill penalty and
you're<00:01:10.049> gonna<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> make<00:01:10.439> sure<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you're gonna want to make sure that is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
you're gonna want to make sure that is
set<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> none<00:01:11.640> I'll<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.060> help<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.450> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
set to none I'll just help you out a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
set to none I'll just help you out a
little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.860> believe<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
little bit but I do believe most of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
little bit but I do believe most of
these<00:01:14.850> other<00:01:15.060> settings<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:15.659> standard

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
these other settings are pretty standard

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
these other settings are pretty standard
but<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.220> through<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.729> make<00:01:17.880> sure

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but if not just go through and make sure

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
but if not just go through and make sure
these<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> same<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.439> health<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
these are all set the same so health and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
these are all set the same so health and
damage<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.790> hope<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> 30%<00:01:21.689> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
damage put that hope down to 30% it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
damage put that hope down to 30% it's
gonna<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.619> give<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> guys<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> few<00:01:23.369> less

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.810 
friendly fire
make<00:01:27.360> sure<00:01:27.630> friendly<00:01:28.229> fire<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> enabled

make sure friendly fire is is enabled
that's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> huge<00:01:30.299> part<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.960> game<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that's a huge part because this game is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
that's a huge part because this game is
like<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:31.979> previous<00:01:32.430> Call<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> Duty's<00:01:32.939> or

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
like you know previous Call of Duty's or

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
like you know previous Call of Duty's or
some<00:01:33.299> previous<00:01:33.750> Call<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> Duty's<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
some previous Call of Duty's where you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
some previous Call of Duty's where you
can<00:01:35.009> hit<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> kill<00:01:35.460> cam<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:35.880> own<00:01:36.119> teammate

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
can hit a kill cam on your own teammate

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
can hit a kill cam on your own teammate
and<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.259> going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> make<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:37.829> easier

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and that's going to make it a lot easier

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.300 
and that's going to make it a lot easier
and<00:01:38.689> just<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:40.229> sure<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> rest<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and just make sure the rest of that is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940 
and just make sure the rest of that is
copied<00:01:41.850> down<00:01:42.000> custom<00:01:42.509> classes<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.290> preset

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
copied down custom classes and preset

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.429 
copied down custom classes and preset
classes<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.750> don't<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.990> matter<00:01:46.170> there

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
classes don't don't really matter there

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.569 
classes don't don't really matter there
so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> believe<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so I believe that's just about it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
so I believe that's just about it
you<00:01:47.729> guys<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> pause<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> video<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.659> those

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you guys can pause the video on those

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230 
you guys can pause the video on those
and<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.130> friendly<00:01:50.820> bots<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and get those down friendly bots you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.639 
and get those down friendly bots you
might<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:51.600> set<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> 6<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.530> gonna

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
might as well set it to 6 it's gonna

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
practice you could set it like one to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
practice you could set it like one to
three<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.770> you're<00:01:58.979> gonna<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.939> going

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to practice you might as well set it to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
to practice you might as well set it to
6<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.579> set<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> bots<00:02:03.030> difficulty

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

capture area and then within you know
something<00:02:27.420> depends<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.870> how<00:02:28.080> long<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.650> games

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860

depending on how much momentum your team

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.900 
depending on how much momentum your team
has<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.220> switch<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.640> for<00:02:53.790> right

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
has it's going to switch so for right

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
has it's going to switch so for right
now<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> bots<00:02:55.440> are<00:02:55.620> gonna<00:02:55.709> go

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
now all the all the bots are gonna go

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.040 
now all the all the bots are gonna go
they<00:02:56.280> are<00:02:56.310> going<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.760> run<00:02:57.270> into<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.690> spot

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
they are going to run into that spot

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.440 
they are going to run into that spot
there<00:02:58.260> most<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.830> anyways<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.400> this<00:03:00.300> is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
there most of them anyways and this is

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.000 
there most of them anyways and this is
where<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.810> guys<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.410> go<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:01.890> your

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
where you guys can you know go for your

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.560 
where you guys can you know go for your
trick<00:03:02.250> shots<00:03:02.490> see<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.000> guys<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.390> hit

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
trick shots see what you guys can hit

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.330 
trick shots see what you guys can hit
and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.350> within<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.709> little<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.130> time

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
and then within a little bit of time

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
and then within a little bit of time
it's<00:03:05.610> going<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.940> move<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> different<00:03:06.540> spot

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it's going to move to a different spot

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.320 
it's going to move to a different spot
and<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:08.010> know<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.340> keep<00:03:08.459> sort<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> rotating

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
and you know just keep sort of rotating

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.199 
and you know just keep sort of rotating
around<00:03:09.720> now<00:03:09.900> one<00:03:10.200> thing<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.470> note<00:03:10.970> when<00:03:11.970> your

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
around now one thing to note when your

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.810 
around now one thing to note when your
team<00:03:12.510> gets<00:03:12.900> too<00:03:13.110> much<00:03:13.260> momentum<00:03:13.740> I<00:03:14.190> recommend

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
team gets too much momentum I recommend

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.490 
team gets too much momentum I recommend
just<00:03:14.880> switching<00:03:15.420> teams<00:03:15.660> let<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.110> other<00:03:16.290> team

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
just switching teams let the other team

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.590 
just switching teams let the other team
capture<00:03:17.070> one<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.519> switch<00:03:17.880> back<00:03:17.910> because

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
capture one and then switch back because

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.880 
capture one and then switch back because
once<00:03:18.780> they<00:03:18.900> get<00:03:19.019> too<00:03:19.140> much<00:03:19.170> momentum<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.769> goes

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
once they get too much momentum it goes

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.530 
once they get too much momentum it goes
really<00:03:20.160> quick<00:03:20.489> although<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.450> guys

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
really quick although some of you guys

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.030 
really quick although some of you guys
might<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.230> because<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.680> thing<00:03:22.860> that's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
might like that because one thing that's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.729 
might like that because one thing that's
cool<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.580> is<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.910> actually<00:03:24.239> almost

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
cool with this is it actually almost

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.750 
cool with this is it actually almost
reminds<00:03:25.739> me<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.130> public<00:03:26.580> match

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
reminds me of like a public match

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.790 
reminds me of like a public match
atmosphere<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.080> got<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.470> hit<00:03:28.590> those

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
atmosphere because you got to hit those

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.110 
atmosphere because you got to hit those
shots<00:03:28.830> quick<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.459> don't<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.700> time<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.090> just

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
shots quick you don't have time to just

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.330 
shots quick you don't have time to just
sit<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.900> stuff<00:03:31.709> like<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.190> does

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
sit there and stuff like that so it does

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860 
sit there and stuff like that so it does
really<00:03:32.550> get<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.030> ready<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.480> help<00:03:33.690> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
really get you ready and help you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.870 
really get you ready and help you
practice<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:35.190> know<00:03:35.280> if<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.519> want<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.790> hit

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
practice for you know if you want to hit

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.940 
practice for you know if you want to hit
a<00:03:35.940> shot<00:03:36.239> on<00:03:36.450> public<00:03:36.900> match<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.410> that's

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
a shot on public match so that's

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.130 
a shot on public match so that's
basically<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.790> one<00:03:39.090> thing<00:03:39.300> also<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.720> remember

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
basically it one thing also to remember

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.840 
basically it one thing also to remember
is<00:03:40.290> make<00:03:40.620> sure<00:03:40.650> your<00:03:41.220> team<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.489> winning

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
is make sure your team is winning

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520 
is make sure your team is winning
because<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.810> hit<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> kill<00:03:43.200> cam<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
because if you hit a kill cam and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.020 
because if you hit a kill cam and
they're<00:03:43.650> not<00:03:43.799> winning<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.340> not<00:03:44.489> 100%<00:03:45.000> sure

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
they're not winning I'm not 100% sure

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.520 
they're not winning I'm not 100% sure
what<00:03:45.239> happens<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.570> it's<00:03:45.690> tied<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:45.959> think<00:03:46.380> you'll

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
what happens if it's tied I think you'll

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.900 
what happens if it's tied I think you'll
still<00:03:46.769> get<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:46.980> kill<00:03:47.220> cam<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.580> I'm<00:03:47.640> not<00:03:47.760> how

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
still get the kill cam but I'm not how

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.820 
still get the kill cam but I'm not how
to<00:03:47.970> present<00:03:48.120> sure<00:03:48.450> but<00:03:49.049> just<00:03:49.260> make<00:03:49.440> sure<00:03:49.620> your

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
to present sure but just make sure your

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.229 
to present sure but just make sure your
team<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.190> winning<00:03:50.400> because<00:03:50.670> if<00:03:50.910> they're<00:03:51.060> not

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
team is winning because if they're not

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.300 
team is winning because if they're not
winning<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.470> hit<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> kill<00:03:52.920> cam<00:03:53.130> it's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
winning and you hit the kill cam it's

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.940 
winning and you hit the kill cam it's
not<00:03:53.459> gonna<00:03:53.670> show<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.630> do<00:03:54.959> believe<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
not gonna show up so I do believe that

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.520 
not gonna show up so I do believe that
is<00:03:56.190> pretty<00:03:56.549> much<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.630> video<00:03:58.290> um

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
is pretty much it for this video um

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.100 
is pretty much it for this video um
again<00:03:59.370> I'm<00:03:59.700> not<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> founder<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:00.510> I'll<00:04:00.660> put

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
again I'm not the founder this I'll put

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.479

a<00:04:01.140> link<00:04:01.320> in<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> description<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.220> person

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
a link in the description to the person

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.060 
a link in the description to the person
who<00:04:02.549> showed<00:04:02.790> me<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.030> um<00:04:03.620> there<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> few

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.860 
who showed me this um there is a few
other<00:04:05.100> ways<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.519> do<00:04:05.760> believe<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.360> how<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.600> get

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
other ways I do believe on how to get

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.870 
other ways I do believe on how to get
this<00:04:07.140> sort<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.799> happen<00:04:07.830> but<00:04:08.640> I<00:04:08.850> just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
this sort of thing to happen but I just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.250 
this sort of thing to happen but I just
thought<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.330> one<00:04:09.480> was<00:04:09.570> pretty<00:04:09.750> cool<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.019> liked

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
thought this one was pretty cool I liked

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.080 
thought this one was pretty cool I liked
how<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.440> rotated<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.250> guys<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.820> know<00:04:11.910> get

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
how it rotated you guys can you know get

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.150
