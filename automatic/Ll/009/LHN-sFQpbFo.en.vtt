00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.910
 here is another achievement of fred m 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:12.049
 who is the soul knife of caen 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 the soul she apostrophe to m 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:19.380
 little word game excuse me here that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.170
 is a raw forge knife forged in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.510
 an old file that has the particularity 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.220
 to have a high carbon content of a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.410
 percent 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.449
 know that at 2% we have cast iron 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.399
 so it's a very, very beautiful 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.860
 knives that is 8 mm thick to his 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.930
 widest point so a real knife 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 of kraft mouth that whoever 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 all the tasks you can him 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 then ask initially but not 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 not familiar with raw knives 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.340
 like this I have a doubt about on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 on his comfort on his holding in hand 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 and because of its width and work 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.920
 of fred really same meaning by ropes 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.739
 or leather lace around the neck 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 we have here a knife that holds well 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.650
 in hand that does not hurt and so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 it is quite surprising for me in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 anyway so here is a very very beautiful 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 knife 1% carbon threads slightly 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.060
 convex as does fred on the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.090
 most of his achievements then free 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.390
 you then take part in the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.549
 ropes and surround it around your 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.400
 handle from leather to a string 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.009
 leather penguin is like you want 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.880
 but as is with a plus a superb 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.490
 hammering job as it is a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.369
 knife that stays very very very 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 comfortable book is of course with 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:02:01.070
 its hand-stitched leather case 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.070
 so here is the soul of caen by fred m
