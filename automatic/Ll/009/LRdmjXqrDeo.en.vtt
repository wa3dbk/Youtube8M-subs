00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.300
 I will offer you a recipe for 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.100
 mashed sweet potato it's a dish 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.359
 delicious that changes a little bit of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 mashed potatoes 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 I rediscovered the sweet potato there is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 a year or so we eat it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 essentially in salad floods it's 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.780
 delicious and one evening my husband has arrived 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 by offering me this recipe out of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 god seoul he had already thought about milk 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 coconut and it's true that I was 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.440
 totally packed right away and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.640
 we were not disappointed at all because 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.410
 it's just exquisite and it's gone 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.270
 for the ingredients you need two 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 or three sweet potatoes it depends on the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.570
 sweet potato size these are 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 huge so that's why I do not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 have more than two you need 3 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 tablespoons of coconut milk from 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.320
 paprika and 3 cloves of garlic 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.790
 to start you peel your potatoes 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 sweet the skin is a little bit more 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.390
 harder than that of potatoes 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.760
 normal cut them into small pieces 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 to not cook them too much 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.600
 long peel also your there 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 put water on the fire 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 where you put your pieces 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 sweet potatoes and your hague 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 ten minutes later when your 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 sweet potatoes are close to you listen 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 all this I have no mashed press so 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.119
 I crush with a fork and in fact 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 it's really very very very easy 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.530
 when you have a beautiful texture you 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.159
 add 3 tablespoons milk of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.049
 coco and bape apply to a pure delight 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 I am a vegetarian so 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.049
 I accompany my sweet potato puree 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 a green salad 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.930
 for the rest of my family I 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 add in addition a sausage of 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.100
 frankfurt 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100
