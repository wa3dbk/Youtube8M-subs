look closely at the safe and the way

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.189 
look closely at the safe and the way
that<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:58.820> used<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.449> we've<00:00:59.629> done<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.870> lot<00:00:59.960> of

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
that it's used and we've done a lot of

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.990 
that it's used and we've done a lot of
work<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.530> redesign<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.160> combination<00:01:01.789> lock

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
work to redesign the combination lock

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.700 
work to redesign the combination lock
we've<00:01:02.780> switched<00:01:03.079> from<00:01:03.350> what<00:01:03.590> we

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
we've switched from what we

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.590 
we've switched from what we
traditionally<00:01:03.949> use<00:01:04.550> which<00:01:04.820> was<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> left<00:01:05.299> right

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
traditionally use which was a left right

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.990 
traditionally use which was a left right
left<00:01:05.900> opening<00:01:06.320> pattern<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.369> right<00:01:07.700> left

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
left opening pattern to a right left

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.999 
left opening pattern to a right left
right<00:01:08.270> opening<00:01:08.780> pattern<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.740> think<00:01:09.920> that's

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
right opening pattern we think that's

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.530 
right opening pattern we think that's
going<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.250> be<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.400> lot<00:01:10.610> more<00:01:10.640> intuitive<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.450> its

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
going to be a lot more intuitive and its

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.630 
going to be a lot more intuitive and its
really<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:11.930> line<00:01:12.200> with<00:01:12.770> every<00:01:13.189> lock<00:01:13.430> you've

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
really in line with every lock you've

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.039 
really in line with every lock you've
used<00:01:13.820> from<00:01:14.030> your<00:01:14.180> high<00:01:14.270> school<00:01:14.540> gym<00:01:14.780> locker

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
used from your high school gym locker

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.890 
used from your high school gym locker
until<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:15.850> we've<00:01:16.850> also<00:01:17.000> added<00:01:17.329> a<00:01:17.570> crisp

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
until now we've also added a crisp

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.410 
until now we've also added a crisp
audible<00:01:18.530> click<00:01:18.890> when<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.310> turn<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.640> dial<00:01:19.970> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
audible click when you turn the dial it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.880 
audible click when you turn the dial it
makes<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.780> really<00:01:20.930> easy<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.470> know<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.770> you've

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
makes it really easy to know that you've

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.560 
makes it really easy to know that you've
got<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.159> right<00:01:22.310> combination<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.509> can

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
got the right combination in so you can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.660 
got the right combination in so you can
get<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.869> your<00:01:24.020> safe<00:01:24.259> get<00:01:24.979> what<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.250> need<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the security features and we edited a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.100
