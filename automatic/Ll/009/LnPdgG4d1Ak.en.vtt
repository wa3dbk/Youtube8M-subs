rocketdock will pop up with all your
favorite<00:02:36.940> applications<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.959> i<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.400> recommend

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
favorite applications and i do recommend

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.180 
favorite applications and i do recommend
minimizing<00:02:40.900> windows<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.680> doc<00:02:41.920> for

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
minimizing windows to the doc for

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.470 
minimizing windows to the doc for
instance<00:02:42.489> if<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.850> wanted<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.120> minimize<00:02:43.269> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
instance if you wanted to minimize a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.050 
instance if you wanted to minimize a
window<00:02:43.709> not<00:02:44.709> only<00:02:44.890> would<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.220> minimize<00:02:45.730> down

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
window not only would it minimize down

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.030 
window not only would it minimize down
here<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.570> minimize<00:02:46.930> right<00:02:47.380> up<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:47.680> your<00:02:47.800> dog

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
here and minimize right up on your dog

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.870 
here and minimize right up on your dog
so<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.400> easy<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.790> get<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.980> next<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.130> icons

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
so it's easy to get to next is the icons

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.720 
so it's easy to get to next is the icons
i<00:02:52.410> would<00:02:53.410> definitely<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.860> for<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.220> higher

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
i would definitely go for the higher

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.580 
i would definitely go for the higher
quality<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.080> see<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
quality you can see that the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.890 
quality you can see that the
applications<00:02:57.250> look<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:57.820> nice<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.690> doc

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
applications look really nice in the doc

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.420 
applications look really nice in the doc
and<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.430> also<00:03:00.580> change<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.420> size<00:03:01.830> and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.900 

that's<00:03:06.430> pretty<00:03:06.610> much<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.880> for<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.630> icons<00:03:08.910> here

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
that's pretty much it for the icons here

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.460 
that's pretty much it for the icons here
at<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> position<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.660> can<00:03:10.780> choose<00:03:11.080> where<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
at the position you can choose where you

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.640 
at the position you can choose where you
want<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.920> doc<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.810> at<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.900> top<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.470> bottom

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
want the doc to be at the top the bottom

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.460 
want the doc to be at the top the bottom
the<00:03:15.100> left<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.580> right<00:03:15.959> if<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.080> want<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.350> to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
the left or the right if you want it to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.190 
the left or the right if you want it to
look<00:03:17.620> like<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:18.130> Mac<00:03:18.670> I'd<00:03:19.090> choose<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.870> bottom

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
look like a Mac I'd choose the bottom

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.350 
look like a Mac I'd choose the bottom
and<00:03:20.430> layering<00:03:21.430> outgoing<00:03:22.000> always<00:03:22.209> on<00:03:22.660> bottom

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
and layering outgoing always on bottom

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.190 
and layering outgoing always on bottom
next<00:03:25.360> is<00:03:25.510> style<00:03:26.130> as<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.340> see<00:03:27.610> our<00:03:28.200> rocket

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
next is style as you see our rocket

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.320 
next is style as you see our rocket
comes<00:03:29.650> with<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> lot<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.430> cool<00:03:30.850> themes

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.230 

I<00:03:34.310> think<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.430> um<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:37.310> think<00:03:38.310> simply<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.180> a

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
I think that um I think simply is a

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.810 
I think that um I think simply is a
pretty<00:03:39.570> good<00:03:39.840> Mac<00:03:40.260> doc<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:42.950> last<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.220> behavior

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
pretty good Mac doc and last is behavior

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.470 
pretty good Mac doc and last is behavior
I<00:03:45.090> would<00:03:45.840> go<00:03:45.990> with<00:03:46.020> bounce<00:03:47.090> every<00:03:48.090> time<00:03:48.270> you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
I would go with bounce every time you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.150 
I would go with bounce every time you
click<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:49.020> icon<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.680> we'll<00:03:49.830> just<00:03:50.010> bounce

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
click on an icon and we'll just bounce

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.540 
click on an icon and we'll just bounce
just<00:03:50.520> like<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> Mac<00:03:51.120> doc<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:53.100> course<00:03:53.130> the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
just like a Mac doc and of course the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.850 
just like a Mac doc and of course the
about<00:03:53.880> page<00:03:54.650> some<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.130> update<00:03:56.700> options<00:03:57.240> and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
about page some the update options and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.280 
about page some the update options and
it<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.010> made<00:03:59.220> by<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.460> punks<00:03:59.970> off<00:04:00.120> our<00:04:00.330> team<00:04:00.510> so

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
as you can see the rocket dock is a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.430 
as you can see the rocket dock is a
great<00:04:04.770> application<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:05.880> highly

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
great application and is highly

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.150 
great application and is highly
customizable<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:09.450> now<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:09.990> have<00:04:10.170> our<00:04:10.590> rocket

your Windows PC is already starting to

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.530 
your Windows PC is already starting to
resemble<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.770> Mac<00:04:26.160> computer<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.970> all<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:27.360> need
