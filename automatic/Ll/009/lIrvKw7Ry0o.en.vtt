and<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.120> can<00:02:04.300> make<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.630> layer<00:02:04.840> via<00:02:05.650> copy<00:02:05.860> or

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
and you can make a layer via copy or

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.550 
and you can make a layer via copy or
just<00:02:06.910> copy<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.690> rim<00:02:08.320> by<00:02:09.210> pressing<00:02:10.210> ctrl<00:02:10.570> C<00:02:10.869> or

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
just copy the rim by pressing ctrl C or

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
just copy the rim by pressing ctrl C or
go<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> edit<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.470> copy

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
go to edit and copy

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.500 
go to edit and copy
and<00:02:16.049> then<00:02:16.620> go<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> layer<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.299> tap

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and then go to the layer to the tap

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.259 
and then go to the layer to the tap
sorry<00:02:18.750> where<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.700> original<00:02:20.700> images<00:02:21.030> and

press control V or edit paste now we

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.980 
press control V or edit paste now we
have<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.060> rim<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:28.500> our<00:02:28.829> original<00:02:29.430> image

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
have the rim in our original image

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.050 
have the rim in our original image
and<00:02:31.470> before<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.010> start<00:02:32.040> manipulating<00:02:32.460> with<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and before we start manipulating with it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.180 
and before we start manipulating with it
we<00:02:33.510> need<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> convert<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.260> smart<00:02:34.650> object

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
we need to convert it to smart object

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.230 
we need to convert it to smart object
now<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.990> do<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.800> control<00:02:38.240> right

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
now to do that you can control right

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.890 
now to do that you can control right
click<00:02:39.890> right<00:02:40.890> click<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.580> convert<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.480> smart

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
click right click and convert to smart

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.060 
click right click and convert to smart
object<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.730> layer<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.060> we've<00:02:45.180> created

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
object on the layer that we've created

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.160 
object on the layer that we've created
and<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.220> will<00:02:47.370> convert<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.720> brim<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
and that will convert the brim to a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.600 
and that will convert the brim to a
smart<00:02:49.410> object<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> reason<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.580> this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
smart object now the reason we do this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
smart object now the reason we do this
is<00:02:50.940> because<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> smart<00:02:52.050> object

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
is because if it's not a smart object

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.640 
is because if it's not a smart object
and<00:02:52.740> if<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.310> try<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.550> manipulate<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and if you try to manipulate it and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.820 
and if you try to manipulate it and
somewhere<00:02:56.370> along<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.850> way<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.530> make<00:02:58.710> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
somewhere along the way we just make it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.650 
somewhere along the way we just make it
too<00:02:58.950> small<00:02:59.070> press<00:02:59.550> Enter<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.090> then<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.480> want

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
too small press Enter and then we want

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.430 
too small press Enter and then we want
to<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.960> back

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
to get it back

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.190 
to get it back
larger<00:03:02.100> again<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.640> press<00:03:03.240> Enter<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.930> you'll

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
larger again and press Enter and you'll

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470 
larger again and press Enter and you'll
see<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:05.160> transformation<00:03:05.940> will<00:03:06.090> destroy

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
see it that transformation will destroy

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.250 
see it that transformation will destroy
the<00:03:06.720> actual<00:03:07.110> image<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.560> will<00:03:08.160> blur<00:03:08.460> up<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.260> to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the actual image it will blur up and to

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
the actual image it will blur up and to
avoid<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.880> we're<00:03:11.880> gonna<00:03:12.000> convert<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.510> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
avoid that we're gonna convert it to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.900 
avoid that we're gonna convert it to
smart<00:03:12.870> object<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:13.620> right-click<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
smart object so just right-click on the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.960 
smart object so just right-click on the
brim<00:03:15.470> select<00:03:16.470> convert<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.830> smart<00:03:17.160> object<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
brim select convert to smart object and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.450 
brim select convert to smart object and
then<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.810> try<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.050> manipulate<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.860> by

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
then if we try to manipulate it by

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.460 
then if we try to manipulate it by
pressing<00:03:20.670> ctrl<00:03:20.850> T

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.030 

scale<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> down<00:03:24.400> press<00:03:25.360> Enter<00:03:25.810> ctrl<00:03:26.590> T<00:03:26.800> again

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
scale it down press Enter ctrl T again

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.400 
scale it down press Enter ctrl T again
scale<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.850> up<00:03:27.940> press<00:03:28.900> Enter

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
scale it up press Enter

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.350 
scale it up press Enter
you<00:03:29.500> see<00:03:29.710> there's<00:03:29.980> no<00:03:30.160> loss<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.370> quality<00:03:30.580> so

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
you see there's no loss in quality so

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.630 
you see there's no loss in quality so
that's<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> reason<00:03:31.780> we<00:03:32.110> need<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.370> have<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that's the reason we need to have the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880 
that's the reason we need to have the
layers<00:03:33.850> smart<00:03:34.690> object<00:03:35.020> when<00:03:35.140> we<00:03:35.290> manipulate

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
layers smart object when we manipulate

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.300 
layers smart object when we manipulate
them<00:03:36.030> now<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.090> can<00:03:37.480> position<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.900> brim<00:03:38.310> press

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
them now we can position the brim press

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.780 
them now we can position the brim press
ctrl<00:03:39.700> T<00:03:39.730> right<00:03:40.660> click<00:03:40.960> and<00:03:41.280> flip<00:03:42.280> horizontal

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
ctrl T right click and flip horizontal

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.160 
ctrl T right click and flip horizontal
to<00:03:43.030> get<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.540> proper<00:03:44.020> angle<00:03:45.300> then<00:03:46.300> hold<00:03:47.050> shift

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
to get the proper angle then hold shift

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.640 
to get the proper angle then hold shift
while<00:03:47.950> scaling<00:03:48.370> down<00:03:48.750> actual<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.530> actual

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
while scaling down actual the actual

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.190 
while scaling down actual the actual
burn<00:03:51.010> because<00:03:51.160> if<00:03:51.520> you<00:03:51.610> don't<00:03:51.790> hold<00:03:51.880> shift<00:03:52.210> it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
burn because if you don't hold shift it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.440

will<00:03:53.350> distort<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:54.160> image<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.940> won't<00:03:55.210> scale

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
will distort the image you won't scale

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.090 
will distort the image you won't scale
down<00:03:55.690> proportionally<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:56.890> hold

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.890 
down proportionally and if you hold
shift<00:03:57.430> they<00:03:58.120> will<00:03:58.270> scale<00:03:58.720> down

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
shift they will scale down

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.280 
shift they will scale down

proportionally and will look better that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.580 
proportionally and will look better that
way<00:04:03.240> so<00:04:04.240> just<00:04:04.450> position<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:04.990> around<00:04:05.440> the
