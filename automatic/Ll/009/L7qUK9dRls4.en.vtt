00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello friends here we are with a new 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 video a new tutorial for 2014 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 something that I have been asked for quite 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.670
 time and it's how to make a player 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.890
 run and uncheck to be able to receive 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 the good pass something we could do in 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.480
 2013 fish only that we changed the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.769
 controls for the 2014 fish is very easy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.679
 to do now I think it's more 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.119
 easy that in 2013 and good the 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.829
 Controls are the following first 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.509
 we have to know which player is the one 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.310
 let's select in this case I'm going to 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.640
 select the one above we keep 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.890
 pressed the e1 or lb in xbox and the stick 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.840
 right pointing towards the player in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 this case is going to be selected 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.630
 automatically the player and it's going to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 start running towards space to 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.530
 empty and we will be able to send the pass 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 with arrived with triangle is something very 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 easy to do what we can do too 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
 with defense players so that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 start running in this case I'm going to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.900
 select the left side 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 there it is going to look like a light 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.400
 yellow a blue light on it goes to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.990
 start running and then we can 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.550
 send the pass here in this case was 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.380
 very marked can not send the pass 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.239
 Now let's see 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.640
 player a forward who is running 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.590
 by the top point there is what 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.120
 selected and automatically sent him the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.610
 fast pass and he will win you in 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.260
 speed is going to serve us a lot this 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.090
 played so that the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.090
 players forward to be able to send you 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.980
 you go through vacuum and it's very useful then 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.990
 here I leave you again the play there 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.330
 are we select them he starts to 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 run and we can send him the pass and there 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.050
 he hooked a normal coupling passes 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.760
 right and fine with power to low 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.000
 As I tell you, it's too easy 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.760
 now in the ppl 2014 since before it was a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.619
 little complicated press the stick to 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 that the players ran at 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.700
 general whenever I pressed him 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.490
 passes on the foot over the ball and does not 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.710
 what I selected them now is much more 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.390
