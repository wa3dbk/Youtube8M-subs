again<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:52.500> like<00:04:52.620> two<00:04:52.830> people<00:04:53.100> know<00:04:53.430> they're

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
again so like two people know they're

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.460 
again so like two people know they're
just<00:04:53.850> afk<00:04:55.310> okay<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.370> they're<00:04:56.850> afk<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:58.350> they

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
just afk okay so they're afk and they

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.080 
just afk okay so they're afk and they
were<00:04:58.530> spawning<00:04:58.890> over<00:04:59.190> here<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.640> means<00:04:59.790> we

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
were spawning over here that means we

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.840 
were spawning over here that means we
should<00:05:00.300> have<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.480> guy<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:01.140> here<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.850> guess
