00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860
 Well, no 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.860
 i 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.120
 yes 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.230
 hello everyone welcome to my face a 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.270
 Again today I bring you a review of a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.860
 product I already know that not tons of 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.849
 reviews of this product in the in 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.740
 youtube but you asked me 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.230
 quite so I'm not going to do it 's the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.460
 pallet in x of urban and came 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.990
 it is a palette 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.370
 I really like that state 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.600
 enough time behind her until 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.300
 I could buy it because it was the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.130
 breakage of stock to almost three months behind 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.560
 of her and I would buy her almost a couple of 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.360
 Today they will talk directly and 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.530
 of the product is a palette that has 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.970
 like a tissue like bread 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.620
 as well as with hair on the outside 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.080
 with the golden letters in which you 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 go dyke and you open inside and you have in the 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.630
 part above the mirror that is like the 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
 half the space of the pallet and the 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.550
 engraving of naked in gold in the part 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.899
 below we have the shadows lights and a 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.580
 brush of shadows that this is the only thing 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.930
 that I regret having achieved 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.070
 I would have preferred it had been 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.310
 24/7 brush mac eye pencil but 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.229
 well this is that they came more a brush 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.790
 of very basic shadows supposedly that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.440
 is for shadows but being synthetic and 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.509
 use more then to add cream to 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.509
 prime is shadow eye or even 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.210
 for the concealer and the shadows of a 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.330
 once inside are 12 shades with a gram 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.130
 one with three grams each 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 which is almost the size of a shadow 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.900
 normal and for forty euros of shadows 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.750
 the shadows are very well priced 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.550
 they range from a very clear range as 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.280
 point of light until quite dark to 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.620
 make us then much more intense and with 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 a single palette because you would have looks of 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.350
 day and then we would increase up to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.390
 have night looks on the palettes there 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 only two that are mate and the kiss are 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.760
 or frost or with a lot more glitter I'm going 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.350
 a little bit by little 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.870
 doing a few jumps for you to see 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.399
 We are for virgin who is my without one of 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.950
 my shadows from the point of light ni 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.780
 transferred has a color as white 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.850
 Rosita stick well enough with 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.180
 pretty brillito the next would be without 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.859
 which is the color of the base 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.370
 then the next one would be yes that is the 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:29.310
 color of the shadow base that is the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.280
 pre base 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170
 a very nice pink color 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.350
 next naked that is a light color 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.040
 brown mate 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.920
 then we would have a cycle that is a color 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 like between bronze pink brown that 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.530
 it has enough glitter our of is 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.780
 more next glitter would be back that is 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.400
 a color also matte darker brown 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.200
 perfect for day looks to do the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.440
 give depth the banana the next 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.020
 I would have beige that is a golden 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.240
 pretty bright milestone the next 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.680
 we would have smac that is a mis 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.040
 favorite is that it's a mix between a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.550
 gold and a precious bronze the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 next would be the dark horse or dark 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.050
 horse that would be like a color between 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.150
 golden bronze and green very nice too 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.870
 then we have toast that is a rose and 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.520
 curly pretty dark but very nice 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.010
 then we would have the hudson that would be 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.760
 as a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.760
 dark purple 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.480
 then we script it never 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.230
 used is like a black with glitter 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.230
 of different colors 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.780
 and finally it would be in Cameron 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.000
 it's like a metallized a metallic gray 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.620
 very beautiful and those are all colors 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.740
 they are some colors very shades very 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.960
 Pigmented Tirana is a shadow is 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.510
 very very very pigmented is a palette 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.920
 that if they are 40 euros of investment but it is 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.530
 a palette that suits you for looks 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.510
 night and day looks 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.000
 with a single palette as it complements you 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.680
 very much all you can not do 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.250
 a lot of look is a palette that deserves 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.810
 It's a pity that if we compare quality-price 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.530
 it's very good the shadow are very 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.080
 pigmented has a gram like at 1.3 a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.500
 gram as 3 each of the shadows a 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.020
 cool 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.180
 the others I think are much more six and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.150
 they are sixteen euros each, imagine 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.950
 how well they are and well I hope 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.140
 that has helped you and so 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.460
 there is a review more of all that 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.620
 there is but he wanted to do it because he is 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.690
 one of my favorite palettes I hope that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.160
 I liked that you found it 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.160
 useful in leaving in the next is what
