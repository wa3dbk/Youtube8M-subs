00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.940
 we are back on day 22 les 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.730
 I bring a nuclear flu in this case 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.740
 Well, you are going to see how the game is 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.840
 somewhat special are the enemies not 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.730
 is that the best players were here 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.760
 of the world but that I could assure you 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.230
 100% who were the worst players in the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.570
 world are you going to see how at the end of the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:29.650
 game ends with a total of 0 37 0 37 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.660
 and 237 is loose people the most people 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.250
 bad with which I found many me 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 you will say ostia creever are leaving 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.710
 kill do not fuck me I do not swear that this 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.790
 people legally joined the game already 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.800
 you know that I have risen in my life 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.690
 no game tomorrow or anything 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.460
 style and good because this would be a simple 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.290
 in normal situations if it would not go up 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420
 because I upload it guys, well, good 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.550
 I wanted to explain that not all 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.469
 nuclear that took me out as he could 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.300
 climb not since there are some very slow 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.789
 others that I do not like for any 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.530
 reason and then there are these nuclear 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.510
 it where enemies are 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.370
 paraplegics do not have hands I do not know what 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.199
 it happens to them that, as you have already seen 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.280
 there are two players who end up with a 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.299
 result of zero 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.460
 and 37 deaths as you can die 37 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.930
 times and not kill anyone 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.790
 it does not come to your head, I would say 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.890
 social this game this morning by 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.450
 cojones then the boys expression is the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.700
 type of games that I can not upload 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.440
 because it looks at the end as it happened 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 the three members of my team we 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 we made a nuclear each one we 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.549
 we are a little bit of the double the truth 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.049
 well I do not but a couple of me yes and good 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.790
 because in the end I got 10 hits my 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.590
 I think companion pulled out 20 hits 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.140
 I know what was taken out of us 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.119
 everything here and that's these games 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.220
 obviously I can not upload it 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.630
 seriously to the channel then good you 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.159
 I ask for a little understanding that I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.289
 You take to joke that you laugh a 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.789
 little bit of the enemies since I do not know 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:55.179
 if they were doing it bet what happens 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.740
 since 0 37 0 37 and 237 no energy that 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.929
 I was inside the game but not 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.789
 I think so much good guys what is 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.259
 I was going to say changes that are coming in 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.729
 the channel is going to start a new 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.649
 series on the boy channel is call of 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 duty 4 you know that right now I'm 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.580
 with the active series of getting the most 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.560
 strong that consists in playing games of 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.060
 one against one until you lose 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.980
 To date we have a total of 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.569
 five or six chapters and I know you like it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.340
 as much good has happened to me 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.830
 do a similar series is worth in the call 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.209
 of duty 4 in this case the series is going to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.340
 call alone against the world 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.530
 I'm going to play games against everyone 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 all game of 8 players and good 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.380
 then to see how you think the series and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.870
 has recorded the first episode the truth 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.060
 is that the game has gone very well 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.739
 it's an impressive result and I'm 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.599
 sure you will love it and well then 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.069
 you'll say good to me now you can 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.470
 say that you think the idea and such as 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.450
 think that the series will reach 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.560
 channel is not going to have acceptance or not and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.120
 well then tomorrow when you see the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.860
 episode because I plan to upload it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.030
 tomorrow you already tell me in the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.799
 comments what did you think of the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.390
 chapter that good if you want that 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.010
 continue with the series and so on to me 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.600
 personally it seems to me a very 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.069
 good the truth 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.930
 'all against all' I know you love 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.760
 the forgiveness the one that will gain strong I know that you 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.709
 love is a series that makes us 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.880
 crazy but good and let's say to me to the 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.370
 time to play I need a little bit of 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.530
 action a little bit of emotion then I have 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.819
 decided not to leave the series of all of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.769
 I won a strong and not much less 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.060
 I will continue with that series but decided 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.130
 enter games of all against all 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.170
 that there is therefore more mobility there are not many 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.520
 people that things can be complicated 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.740
 more, not everything 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.300
 10 but well then other people 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.500
 you can come one in the back 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.030
 another ahead another on the side already 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.680
 see what you do, not because those are the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.810
 moments of emotion that I want I want 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 that you see in all against all and good 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.470
 as the series says it's going to be called just 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.030
 against the world since we are eight 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.860
 players and the game all against 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.480
 all and well then you'll tell me to see 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.530
 How is it that you see what you think and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.470
 Well, I think the idea is 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.360
 pretty good as is your enemies just 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.640
 I 've seen it in my life if only the worst 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.440
 AIDS have cancer right now because 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.820
 I do not know guys these games because as 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.500
 I tell you, I can not go up, I have some 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.660
 how many and the truth is that there 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.670
 quite a few matches like that and well, the 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.470
 directly eliminated them this one because 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.960
 It was funny because they ended up 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.180
 zero in life had seen a 0 37 like this 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.370
 so cheeky and less than two players and 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.840
 They were also a shared screen and 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.720
 Well, I liked it and I wanted to 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.850
 I wanted the abyss in the game 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680
 Well, as I say, I do not want you to 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.030
 you take seriously saying I'm here 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 for tomorrow the game or very much 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.810
 less since it has gone up for messing around 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
 and so to tell you about the series of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.100
 call of duty 4 not right now in the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.450

 say that good will sent a saludito by 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.490

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.290
 quite a few new things and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.090
