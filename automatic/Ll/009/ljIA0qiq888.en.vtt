there<00:02:19.350> was<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.500> basketball<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.550> put<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
there was a basketball one so we put a I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.570 
there was a basketball one so we put a I
know<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.200> basketball<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> middle<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
know some basketball in the middle of it
