it<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.120> mean<00:02:47.959> played<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.290> game<00:02:48.470> enough<00:02:48.709> times

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
it I mean played this game enough times

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.220 
it I mean played this game enough times
I'm<00:02:49.430> hoping<00:02:49.910> I'm<00:02:50.629> gonna<00:02:50.840> be<00:02:50.930> able<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.110> do<00:02:51.200> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
controls are in hindsight I probably

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.050 
controls are in hindsight I probably
should<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.519> done<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.730> training<00:02:56.049> but<00:02:57.049> oh

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060

with<00:04:16.800> it<00:04:16.920> being<00:04:16.950> hard<00:04:17.220> difficulty<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.760> don't

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
with it being hard difficulty you don't

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.600 
with it being hard difficulty you don't
get<00:04:18.090> any<00:04:18.210> of<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.710> got<00:04:19.710> to<00:04:19.800> get<00:04:19.890> any<00:04:20.010> indication
