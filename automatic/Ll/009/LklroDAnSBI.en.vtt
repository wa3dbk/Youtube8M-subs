00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.520
 has already decided to show you in the cup lights 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.990
 fit all small tricks of 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.110
 use when I feel a little 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.780
 sickly, however, remember how everyone 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.900
 sense that I obviously love being too 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 in the cot on the sofa offered to read 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.060
 a good book and without that crazy sunbeds 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.680
 handy 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.720
 according to the born key inserted 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.699
 very much to use who knows what but of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 flanders that repair gap that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.300
 you know them and the stanley cup e in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.550
 most cassate areas aster pass many 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 times of cocoa 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 seen however that in most of the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.640
 cases even these roma ravizza cannot 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.910
 take advantage of all day so I have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.489
 thought that then we will prepare states each 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.800
 aeronautical committee do not think that 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.720
 they are the ones who save life every 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.720
 once in the temple so but the session 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.260
 so let's start immediately with those of the cup 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.390
 first use a bb clip for 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.309
 uniform a little to the complexion and give me 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.309
 a slightly healthier and fresh complexion 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.650
 this is one of my favorites 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.680
 lately because it remains very light 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.570
 on the face easily existing for 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.060
 minimize dark circles first use 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.470
 of everything a concealer in a shade 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.270
 this is what I go to design 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.560
 here is great because once the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.180
 make life already a sense of freshness 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.190
 by over this I am going to roll out 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.259
 corrector of vichy tar ma blend that makes 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.160
 lighten up my dark circles slightly 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.160
 understand it in Syria 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.079
 lucid always comes from stubborn kim 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.000
 of the oreal with the most taken file 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.969
 century makes these also the ascent 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.530
 video of 2016 favorite products e 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:53.319
 I'm just waiting for it 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.630
 good quantum gdf eyebrows not 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.400
 they can draw them so I go to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.650
 switch off 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.420
 the pencil mass even if I'm not sick 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.250
 I can see more if I don't draw 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.500
 at least a little bit this eyebrows 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 Arctic 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 how to fall for the hound to be used 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400
 without remark because I allow myself 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.470
 jacket and form the eyelid you have to give 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.740
 from the squalor that I want very clear in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740
 that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.910
 use a small spoon and go to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.460
 take the lightest color which is a 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.350
 flesh-colored matt and spreads over the whole 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.730
 eyelid up to the eyebrow arch 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.530
 with a large brush then with a 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.330
 pen brush I take this color 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.490
 which is actually a purple but with lights 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.680
 on the baron and I'm going to roll it out like 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.540
 were a row of pretty eyeliner 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.540
 party holding me by the eyelids 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.670
 and then with an appeal eyeliner 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.070
 a roof to the liners I'm going to make a line 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.400
 lots of china for eyelashes 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.610
 further intensify the look 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.540
 the inevitable black kajal under the eye 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.540
 in the interior food 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 and since he does not want to employ 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.750
 the svitzer lashes mascara shock is already 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.700
 unobserved and the head of Andrea 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.700
 of the antipope because I look up 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.959
 and give some color to the cheeks 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.140
 when simply this kind of 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.390
 polluting rate is very convenient because 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.069
 the roll out directly by the skipper and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.069
 then coated with the meshes 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.890
 and finally hydrates the lips and leaves 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.069
 that hour slightly using text 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.170
 league per di rave is not a make up 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.970
 really very simple that I think is 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.390
 great for softening the signs of 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.390
 fatigue 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.170
 the main thing when I choose the 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.990
 written I do not feel very well is that 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.370
 be comfortable warm it really is 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.740
 comfortable because I become a lot 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.060
 suffering 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.710
 obviously I cannot not use i 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.230
 my very comfortable and very warm ed 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.550
 combined with leggings that are 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.550
 equally comfortable and warm 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.459
 the inevitable down jacket because 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.970
 absolutely will meet and the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.090
 hat super hot course my 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.410
 riccione exhibits save their lives 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.600
