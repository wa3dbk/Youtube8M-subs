00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
player ships which i think is pretty

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
player ships which i think is pretty
exciting<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> lot<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> people<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.739> allows

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
exciting to a lot of people it allows

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.200 
exciting to a lot of people it allows
you<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> player

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you to have a little bit of player

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
you to have a little bit of player
housing<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.320> allows<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.590> obviously<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
housing and it allows you obviously to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
housing and it allows you obviously to
travel<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> galaxy<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> two

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
travel the galaxy so those are the two

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.330

things<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.260> we've<00:00:43.500> announced<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.219> are

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
things that we've announced and we are

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.709 
things that we've announced and we are

at<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> point<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.980> also

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
at this point but that I think are also

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.319 
at this point but that I think are also
going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> allay<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> fears<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
going to allay some of the fears of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
going to allay some of the fears of
people<00:00:51.719> who<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> be

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
people who don't think we're going to be

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.799 
people who don't think we're going to be
focused<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> elder<00:00:54.030> game<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.449> other
