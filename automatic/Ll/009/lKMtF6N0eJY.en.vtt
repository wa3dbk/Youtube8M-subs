00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.370
 this video offering peripherals 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.900
 pcs more information on the link 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 valued description andrÃ© que beleza 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.259
 It's very dark that I turned all of them off. 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.519
 the streets to see if you can capture a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.260
 little better with our camcorder 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 filming a monitor directly, I'm 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'm testing the boss today and in 4k 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.180
 all in utah 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.590
 so let's take a look at that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.980
 first in the video the configuration of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.109
 video resolution is in 100% of cases 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 3,840 for 2,160 we are using ours to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.610
 gtx is coming saying is applying 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.530
 that the settings were already in the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.480
 but only to leave a doubt 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 none we will return here options 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.690
 advanced beyond the people can vote 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 in the world too high let's apply 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 put it now that another is to ensure 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 We apply sunscreen now. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.149
 obviously with the texture pack is 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.739
 installed and we will see how it will be 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 performance ratio in the upper corner 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 left of the screen to put in 720 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 this is the maximum size that appears 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.750
 one in a row to join at most 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.159
 size since the 4k resolution 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 so it gets really bad we put 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.880
 bigger than that, you can not really 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 greater than this and the minimum 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 maximum is giving up on the side 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.840
 right is watching in a bit to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 twice and if this benchmark because in the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.189
 that torment that fell from 30 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.820
 Sometimes here frames about 30 front 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.549
 look that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.810
 sometimes falls from 30 French had 32 33 and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.150
 actually come back once a benchmark 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 For you and I'm going to play a little 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 do the normal gameplay there to see if 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.460
 we can see falls in frames 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.630
 It's worth remembering that we 're not attracted to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.970
 both z 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.610
 we are 47 90 in stock and 16 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 gb memory okay so let's 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 verified in the gameplay that nuno gomes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.560
 brand that is already ending 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 It is worth remembering that we are using a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.329
 monitor 4k 60 harry is with connection 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.399
 displayport then just to make it alright 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 specified to show bench is then 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.210
 stayed in a minimum of 23,198 of 44 and maximum 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.040
 of 95 front are let's love it then 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.450
 Let's see if it will fall from 30 fronts in the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.680
 normal gameplay ta 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 I'm going to play, I 'm going to play 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 continue adventure mode I finished the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.510
 game I was 100% once and now I am 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.060
 100% again, it 's a very big addiction. 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.160
 at the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.680
 A chief mor can see that really 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.930
 asked for 6 GB of memory to use the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.940
 texture pack in hd and that's it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.340
 that is being used in action 16 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.870
 gigas of memory let's give a 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.500
 verified in 52 chicken 4032 frames 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.340
 That guy is fine, let's go and kill some. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.340
 organs 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.319
 Christmas the people there. 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.160
 obviously we feel the fall from 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.870
 frames are not people locked but I felt one 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 fall of chickens when the game is in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.140
 around 50 and you end up falling there to 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.630
 30 and a little bit ends up giving that light 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.990
 front drop is a crowd rate and 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.510
 see if we can get there and not give 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.130
 Let's have a run for the map. 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.810
 so much to simulate and let's make that 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.910
 bonfire purely when we are 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.900
 at the stake a fall from 43 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.490
 at this time 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.380
 Look, let's just see 3232 practice sessions. 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.180
 least a little less than 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.610
 not being able to full time in front 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.740
 missing the screen so it fell head-on 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.930
 please mark in the video there that the 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.880
 Get a one conversed also in 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.550
 Sequel, let's have a run here. 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.950
 man looks only 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.330
 the guy is too play while he catches 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.330
 very cool to play in 4k 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.720
 I'm going to brutalize 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.810
 stop was was mine 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.810
 on the way back I want to flee the operetta 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.580
 I will hold to not change Let's give some 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.680
 a year but others tower when the people 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.410
 He had that jump in the beginning, he gave a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 good range of frames in the popular going 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.280
 rise and saturn will actually have to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.650
 carry to a tower that a piece 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.780
 It was already appears here're not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.820
 is 30 in 4k even running a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.680
 dealing with it obviously is not with the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.960
 tata 10 faces 60 frames second 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.910
 in front there maybe a little bit more 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.290
 variation because it's the first time 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.520
 the game was I was coming into the game 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:41.930
 it's Thursday 29 look at 29.7 on the hour 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.000
 the explosion is killing the chicken 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.330
 Dude I obviously will not recommend it 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.800
 you run in the womb in 4 letter bound 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.460
 I'm going to recommend that you guys 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.500
 put a moralize I'll recommend 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.450
 that they put in the high or very high 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.450
 That's really great, you're connected. 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.480
 your little foot trail was me died too 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.910
 I think the game got a little dark 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.380
 But I'll try to change it at the time of 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.240
 edition, the newspaper will try to change 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.460
 at the time of editing it's not to be so 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.990
 dark tried to catch a reflection comes 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.270
 boring in our lighting monitor 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.860
 Here I said 'Let's not turn everything off' 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.510
 Let's leave as soon as the guys in the 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.940
 The truth that matters here is the quantity 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.919
 of frames that the game is changing the face 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.740
 but in four cars it inserts the mind I 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.570
 I'll give you a zoom here on earth to give a 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.890
 zoom here in the armor of God arrives 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.250
 near the fire where quality is a 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.250
 little better 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.620
 kill these crazy here 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.490
 fell a little and the chickens 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.750
 I want to be near the fire that I'm going to give 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.600
 A zoom there to show you that 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.020
 was the relation of the quality of the 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.020
 Qatar 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.170
 So take a look, just let the 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.770
 park near the fire let here come a 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.770
 little the camera 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.830
 Look at the face, I do not know if it's on. 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.450
 video will pick up the magnitude of the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.390
 older quality is sensational 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.480
 details of the character in 44 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.540
 everything was very well done look at the 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.980
 caravaggio's mitten was 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.890
 sensational even I hope you guys 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.270
 have liked in relation to the 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.490
 frames and everything else for you to have 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.040
 Such an idea I'm obviously going to repeat 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.730
 we do not recommend running on ultra 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.410
 4k guy in high not too high already okay 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.230
 above the standard I was actually 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.730
 playing when when I got it soon 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.980
 that I put the plate 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.980
 looks down 23 front we could 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:52.730
 make a 23- year drop there 2224 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:56.180
 our now tabulation a continuous but 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.830
 Thank you, an expensive distance. 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.990
 understood now actually began that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.120
 difference then type really I do not 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.350
 I recommend man I would not recommend you guys 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:10.160
 to make such a play in a treaty 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.290
 I recommend it if you let the couple 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.970
 that you want to run in 4k which game 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.710
 What quality everything else please 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.230
 leave it for you to see there 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.790
 started the cool gameplay now using 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.070
 the same amount of memory and a 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.590
 chicken is fall before the crazy game 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.970
 opera even for that reason was in the low and 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.470
 doing our fuck that 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.970
 only when it came close to 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.860
 some texture for example here 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.770
 you will give this texture walk wall 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.180
 You're not going here, you do not look very nice. 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.520
 trained and see what a texture 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:42.050
 half plated a texture well the middle half 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.460
 Dude understood then to take some 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.200
 information this guy here is personal 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.400
 but three had enjoyed the gameplay that 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.220
 leave in the comments what you want 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.450
 see with the cards which games which 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.860
 quality and everything else then let us 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.420
 Comments are we going to do to 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.860
 you're really done 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.090
 we just think I think he 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.920
 appears with the second test is that the 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.900
 I did not give light before and now 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.730
 chelsea warm and in the next days is 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.770
 leaving more tests then let us 

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.230
 comments in the coming weeks 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.180
 we will have tests only in fule hd and will 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.200
 consider legal also then thank you 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.200
 okay, bye, bye
