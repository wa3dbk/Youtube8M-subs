00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.030
 we are back with a video of truth 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.349
 very very special and I really

 all those that have not yet been given 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.699
 account for those who already gave 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.439
 Yesterday we consider the wonderful 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
 amount of here in the three thousand channel 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.830
 Tedax subscribers is very grateful for 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.269
 this and cute and I will try to show 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.619
 it's something that I was asked to do some 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.910
 they know I'm not the best 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.560
 special actions far 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.480
 I just want to take this video to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.769
 show them something so a little special 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.750
 and try to stress all of you 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 the support received and good as you already 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 I said I'm going to show you what would come to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.820
 be my statistics here not what is the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 top 2 let's start obviously so 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 that would come to be with the main thing not my 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.350
 race of what is the cau 2 all the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.670
 things that I have done of the things that I have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.379
 got and all the time that I've 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.239
 been playing and well if we're going to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.289
 try to start quickly 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.000
 obviously so it's the race 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 obviously noticing that we are in the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 prestige teacher we tell you that we have 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 a played time of 14 days with 8 hours 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.399
 51 minutes 53 seconds but we have to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 we have a number of casualties of 81 thousand 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.270
 163 we're already pretty high enough 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 we have a ratio of 220 the truth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 at the beginning it was very fucked 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.280
 lately, I started treating him 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.439
 to fix a little 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.119
 we already have close to 10 million 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.009
 points we are very close to 10 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.390
 millions and we have here what they are 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.189
 some views cards can be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 say that the best quotes what could 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.520
 be the one of the nuclear the teacher of 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.319
 domain equally what is the ultra 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 low for everyone out there that never ever 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.009
 never gave me a chance to put what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.390
 can in a screenshot the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.920
 Truth never gave me as much 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.119
 emotion of this but well then we arrived 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.439
 with the following with what would come to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.209
 be the combat summary in which 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 again we will notice what weapons are 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.579
 more lethal 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.829
 likewise the streak and all this 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.200
 starting because we have six thousand shots 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 to the head at 147 unstoppable those are the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.039
 medals after the nuclear we have 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.520
 an ultra low and well we noticed that my 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.530
 favorite weapons are the mmc area 94 and pw 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.209
 257 being equally what you like 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.069
 to clijster and with my losing streak 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.020
 the one that has given you the most 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.280
 low amount of good we pass to what 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.170
 are the game modes we do not have to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.789
 almost not with many game modes 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.679
 different accounts that mainly 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.149
 game what is domain close to a thousand 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.709
 wins the domain and out there 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.660
 lately they have been giving what is 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.400
 the haarp or at the hot spot and just 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.180
 I started trying to do my little 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.650
 careers 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.819
 now we are going with important something that 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.099
 it really catches my attention 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.629
 we do not have what the medals are for 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.090
 we have to start first - as 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.980
 we have 34 nuclear guys the truth 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.930
 it's pretty good the truth 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 that some of me have really lost what 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.590
 what is the video because the principle then 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.569
 like that does not record much at the beginning such 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.099
 time as I do not know I was leaving the plane and 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.560
 I really did not keep them or was not 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.659
 recording while I was playing now 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.799
 I have 34 nuclear medals guys and here 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.290
 a no matter yunta and very 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.040
 interesting what do we have that I have 34 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.659
 nuclear and we do not have that I have 73 it 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.459
 I could say that brutal or gusts of 25 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.639
 so look at just the proportion 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.889
 I have more than double the chances of 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.560
 fight the nuclear or lose the streak 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:58.230
 nuclear between the medal of 25 and that of 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.090
 30 really is silly I know I know 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.769
 that could have more than 70 nuclear 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 but you do not get more than the number of times 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.419
 that failed has failed many times 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 practically 40 times I have stayed 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.120
 less than 5 of the nuclear and this 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.040
 really, obviously, they are not 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.329
 statistics so good that we say but 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.859
 really so that they realize the 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.359
 Sometimes I was really read but 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.220
 very much it seems that it is still not me 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.810
 they really believe that he fought a lot 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.000
 very much I would say 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.319
 I lose a lot of gusts and good leaving 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.700
 is the theme of the let's go with what 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.720
 that are the weapons we obviously do not have 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.430
 and what are my favorite weapons 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.900
 you have seen them from most of 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.630
 times in examples like online 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.040
 smc in 94 wv as I had already 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.599
 mentioned his moment we do not have to 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.489
 weapons that he never used as they are the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.140
 shotgun the secondary shields and 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.819
 all those nonsense that the truth does not 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.170
 they are good for nothing and good 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.150
 part of the equipment we do not have to 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.410
 favorite always was that 4 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.120
 the truth that was the most coarse 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.440
 using and for the part of the gusts 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.450
 point of the issues that obviously the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.099
 the best are the ones that I have higher 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.440
 they are what the gusts are for 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.700
 we see that we have the level of 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.980
 Orbital seat out there what is the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.180
 counter the pp all this and good guys 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.650
 after diaz practically for 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.540
 finalize this video I want to show you 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.400
 what is the career position a place 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.080
 about 20 thousand we noticed that out there 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.670
 we have about 10 million points 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.260
 the wta that's pretty good with 14 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.730
 played days I think they are very good 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.290
 the ratio and good for the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.730
 part and to end well this video does not 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.019
 I want nothing more to leave behind what 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.970
 are my titles to and in a very 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.380
 very fast and eggs and can save 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.970

 good here in the channel hopefully of 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.820

 much faster than I have done 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.220
 until now 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.630
 over time and while 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.370
 subscribers are growing a little bit 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.480
 more this will go grabbing a flight 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.220

 opportunity should not be given a 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.670
 little bit of entertainment in the skies 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.440
