not<00:00:51.920> part<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.190> thanks

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 

I<00:01:02.460> mean<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.330> helps<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.630> the<00:01:03.690> cows<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.110> be

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I mean it helps that the cows can be

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.720 
I mean it helps that the cows can be
wherever<00:01:04.440> they<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.190> they<00:01:05.220> want<00:01:05.340> to<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
wherever they want when they want to be

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.930 
wherever they want when they want to be
like<00:01:07.040> they're<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.160> forced<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
like they're not forced to be in a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.330 
like they're not forced to be in a
certain<00:01:09.180> area<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.900> day<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.980> they<00:01:11.100> didn't

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
certain area that day that they didn't

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.430 
certain area that day that they didn't
choose<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.550> be<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:12.660> doesn't<00:01:13.020> matter<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
choose to be it doesn't matter if it's

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.290 
choose to be it doesn't matter if it's
Sunday<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.100> holiday<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.670> Christmas<00:01:15.030> Day

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.820 

it<00:01:17.360> doesn't<00:01:17.690> take<00:01:17.810> time<00:01:18.020> off<00:01:18.230> but<00:01:18.470> it's<00:01:18.650> there

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
it doesn't take time off but it's there

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:31.990 
it doesn't take time off but it's there
to<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> minute<00:01:21.110> most<00:01:21.230> those<00:01:22.040> times

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.880 

so<00:01:32.600> it's<00:01:32.720> just<00:01:32.810> one<00:01:33.020> less<00:01:33.140> for<00:01:33.410> we<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.800> do

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
so it's just one less for we have to do

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.590 
so it's just one less for we have to do
plus<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.640> feet<00:01:34.790> getting<00:01:35.060> push<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.330> up<00:01:35.390> more

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
plus the feet getting push it up more

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.260 
plus the feet getting push it up more
often<00:01:36.070> no<00:01:37.070> secret<00:01:37.430> keep<00:01:37.610> more<00:01:37.820> feet<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.150> front

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
often no secret keep more feet in front

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
often no secret keep more feet in front
of<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.420> towel<00:01:38.600> warmer

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.420 

24<00:01:43.210> hours<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.479> day<00:01:43.509> without<00:01:44.439> us<00:01:44.799> doing<00:01:45.250> anything

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
24 hours a day without us doing anything

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
24 hours a day without us doing anything
you<00:01:45.909> know

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
you know

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.390 
you know
so<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:47.869> get<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> feet<00:01:48.350> pushed<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:48.830> lot<00:01:49.070> more

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
so we get the feet pushed in a lot more

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.340 
so we get the feet pushed in a lot more
times<00:01:49.790> throughout<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.240> day<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.930> good<00:01:51.110> labor

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
times throughout the day just good labor

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.230 
times throughout the day just good labor
savings<00:01:51.860> not<00:01:52.070> having<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.580> have<00:01:52.700> someone<00:01:53.060> push

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
savings not having to have someone push

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.289 
savings not having to have someone push
