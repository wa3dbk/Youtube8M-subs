00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.500
 hello we are the couch colossi and we 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.840
 show you the team today as 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.670
 support plays I recommend you with 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.830
 two vision boards three sideboards and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.689
 one of a posse starts your task 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 is to secure your team competitive 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 and get my problems too fast 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.029
 later you should get the curb 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 get and expand this if you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 Both go away for the first time though 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.710
 not yet have the necessary change 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.719
 want a loss 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 then the bus needs the rc movement 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.710
 bulls should expand the msc to the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 adversary to nibble on him or 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 screaming the remaining items as 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.340
 Schillers ode rand ruins are at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.950
 all other supports and should 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.110
 be purchased situationally 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.820
 because Roger Wittmann with level 1 of this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.739
 Style is the best skill and man 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 It should maximize it as early as possible 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.969
 is an easter followed by slow 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.989
 creates vision in bushes and has one 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.500
 very high range 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 the w is a silence and mansfeld in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 with level 2 and modern if he has 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.409
 can not spend a point on the core 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.479
 because he is a safe source of harm 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 the and a lot of hurt one 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.290
 opposing heroes and can be here more often 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.720
 it is used a lot of live competition 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.509
 moreover , it caused cancer to neutral monsters 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.150
 dragon and barrel 1000 liters of match and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 Can we use a 2 2 while 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.689
 I recommend you the learning phase so often 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.409
 as possible a delicious million too 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.670
 consume 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.409
 never forget that nobody likes him 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.110
 Unfortunately, passive does not bring you much there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.400
 it rarely beat cancer to death 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 as a measure quickly points in open to 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 to make harm five points the fans 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 for life regeneration and armor and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 16 points utility for extra gold den 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.399
 Extra word and the biscuit as namely the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 gold Winslet magic, rip luck and orks 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.520
 and cs to enke already in the early plays 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520
 his 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 In this situation we can do very well 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.200
 let's look at precisely set shoves 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 with subsequent lines to trade up 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.030
 destroy the enemy carey 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.030
 gibson the opposing wall and wayne 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.370
 Wait a little too long with one 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.690
 targeted then exploited and drive with 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.690
 a flash the double kids 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.090
 No 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 one should not forget that- shows 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.330
 cubic you are so good industry 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.660
 can get stuck or run into it 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.660
 to have to 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.260
 Schubert is one of the few support 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.760
 with excellent pusher quality with 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.239
 you can quickly lane him out 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.220
 push 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.730
 while your team pressure on the opponents 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.730
 base off 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.660
 through his skills is indeed in 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.160
 later team is still fighting one 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.260
 serious danger to your opponents 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.660
 it succeeded in this scenario 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.370
 through his q2 opponent and ask 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.230
 then they flee with their silence 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.130
 complicate so that in the team and follow 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.130
 the two can do it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.650
 because ultimate is perfect 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:07.830
 as a second time around important objectives 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.239
 like berlin or dragon, so i secure 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.010
 I hope this tour has money right away 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.239
 I really liked it if you liked it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.099
 then you can leave a comment 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.510
 leave and write and just do it 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.560
 look up what else he is so fit 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.560
 make it soon
