this file is a model of a house on the
street<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.130> simple<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.240 

let's<00:00:49.250> put<00:00:49.490> it<00:00:49.580> in<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:49.820> 2d<00:00:50.180> wireframe<00:00:50.420> view<00:00:51.250> so

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
let's put it in a 2d wireframe view so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.950 
let's put it in a 2d wireframe view so
that<00:00:52.400> we<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.610> navigate<00:00:52.790> around<00:00:53.150> it<00:00:53.540> much<00:00:53.720> more

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
that we can navigate around it much more

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.209 
that we can navigate around it much more
easily

AutoCAD<00:00:56.940> can't<00:00:57.359> make<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.780> models<00:00:58.199> or

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
AutoCAD can't make your models or

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.060 
AutoCAD can't make your models or
objects<00:00:59.100> move<00:00:59.690> but<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.649> move

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
objects move but what it can do is move

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
objects move but what it can do is move
through<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.910> model<00:01:03.300> think<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.440> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
through your model think of it as a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.430 
through your model think of it as a
camera<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.400> wheels<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.840> wheels<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
camera on wheels and those wheels and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.490 
camera on wheels and those wheels and
that<00:01:07.799> camera<00:01:08.159> will<00:01:08.759> record<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.690> it<00:01:09.810> sees<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that camera will record what it sees as

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.580 
that camera will record what it sees as
it<00:01:10.950> moves<00:01:11.280> through<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.820> design<00:01:12.210> well<00:01:13.200> that's

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it moves through your design well that's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
it moves through your design well that's
actually<00:01:13.799> exactly<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.240> does<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.590> need

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
actually exactly what it does so we need

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.090 
actually exactly what it does so we need
to<00:01:16.890> tell<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> camera<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.100> where

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to tell the camera where to go and where

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.880 
to tell the camera where to go and where
to<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.940> can<00:01:21.690> do<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.200> two<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to look you can do that in two different

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
to look you can do that in two different
ways<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:23.970> instances<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
ways for both instances you can have the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
ways for both instances you can have the
camera<00:01:26.130> set<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> point<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.659> we'll

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
camera set on a point and then we'll

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.609 
camera set on a point and then we'll
turn<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.770> look<00:01:29.190> towards<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.640> pathway<00:01:30.149> or<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.350> can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
turn or look towards a pathway or it can

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
turn or look towards a pathway or it can
just<00:01:32.070> simply<00:01:32.399> look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.789> point<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.929> you<00:01:33.990> have

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just simply look at a point so you have

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.370 
just simply look at a point so you have
pathways<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> points<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:36.990> camera<00:01:37.350> can

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
pathways and points so the camera can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.680 
pathways and points so the camera can
sit<00:01:37.800> on<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.950> point<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> travel<00:01:39.210> along<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
sit on a point or it can travel along a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.440 
sit on a point or it can travel along a
pathway<00:01:40.050> as<00:01:40.409> its<00:01:41.159> doing<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.330> either

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pathway as its doing that it can either

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350 
pathway as its doing that it can either
look<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.080> fixed<00:01:43.470> point<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> travels

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
look at a fixed point or as it travels

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.899 
look at a fixed point or as it travels
on<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.569> pathway<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.319> can<00:01:46.740> look<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.429> different

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
on a pathway it can look at a different

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.240 
on a pathway it can look at a different
pathway<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.319> little<00:01:49.530> confusing<00:01:49.950> maybe

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
pathway it's a little confusing maybe

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.550 
pathway it's a little confusing maybe
but<00:01:50.640> before<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.360> started<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
but before we get started we need to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.889 
but before we get started we need to
draw<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.979> pathway<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.659> draw<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
draw a pathway and you can draw that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.039 
draw a pathway and you can draw that
with<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> polyline<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> start<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.509> polyline

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
with a polyline so start your polyline

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.639 
with a polyline so start your polyline
command<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.000> just<00:02:00.000> simply<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.929> a<00:02:00.959> path<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
command and just simply make a path that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.059 
command and just simply make a path that
goes<00:02:02.039> around<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.550> house<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.410> be<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> square

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
goes around the house it can be a square

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.529 
goes around the house it can be a square
it<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.970> be<00:02:06.209> anything<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:07.440> don't<00:02:07.619> close<00:02:07.860> it

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
it can be anything just don't close it

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.890 
it can be anything just don't close it
you<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.720> draw<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> line<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.800> any<00:02:11.129> layer<00:02:11.900> now

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you can draw that line on any layer now

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can draw that line on any layer now
what<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> suggest<00:02:13.650> doing<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.250> opening<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.790> your

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
what I suggest doing is opening up your

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.350 
what I suggest doing is opening up your
properties<00:02:15.420> panel<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.340> moving<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> pathway

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
properties panel and moving that pathway

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.780 
properties panel and moving that pathway
up<00:02:18.660> otherwise<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.980> an<00:02:20.099> elevation<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
up otherwise it's on an elevation of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
up otherwise it's on an elevation of
zero<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.569> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.080> looking<00:02:22.379> from

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
zero so you're going to be looking from

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.699 
zero so you're going to be looking from
the<00:02:22.770> ground<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:24.480> type<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.930> ten<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the ground just type in ten for the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.750 
the ground just type in ten for the
elevation<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.720> now<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.050> 10<00:02:28.290> feet<00:02:28.500> high<00:02:28.760> if

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
elevation and now it's 10 feet high if

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.180 
elevation and now it's 10 feet high if
we<00:02:29.940> take<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> look<00:02:30.360> at<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.660> real<00:02:30.780> quick<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:32.040> can

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
we take a look at it real quick you can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.309 
we take a look at it real quick you can
see<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.670> pathway<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.180> elevated<00:02:34.140> just

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
see that pathway is elevated just

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.820 
see that pathway is elevated just
slightly

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.560 

of<00:02:37.310> course<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.820> change<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.240> at<00:02:38.300> any

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
of course you can change this at any

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.560 
of course you can change this at any
time<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:40.070> can<00:02:40.100> go<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.700> set<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
time and you can go and set it to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.420 
time and you can go and set it to
whatever<00:02:41.720> elevation<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.590> need<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.160> set

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
whatever elevation you need it to be set

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.050 
whatever elevation you need it to be set
to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
to
now<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.530> need<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> create<00:02:47.670> a

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the animation is created in this case we

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.699 
the animation is created in this case we
will<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.850> at<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> set<00:03:27.300> point<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.810> pretend<00:03:28.590> that

along<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> certain<00:03:35.220> pathway<00:03:35.550> while<00:03:36.180> you're

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
along a certain pathway while you're

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.900 
along a certain pathway while you're
filming<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:37.739> can't<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> point<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.700> point

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
filming you can't do a point to point

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.840 
filming you can't do a point to point
but<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> path<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.830> point<00:03:41.069> or<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.340> path

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
but you can do a path to point or a path

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.380 
but you can do a path to point or a path
to<00:03:42.060> path<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:44.160> case<00:03:44.400> we're<00:03:44.640> setting<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.209> at

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
to path in this case we're setting up at

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.650 
to path in this case we're setting up at
a<00:03:45.420> point<00:03:45.720> looking<00:03:46.260> at<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> path<00:03:47.180> now<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.239> need<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
a point looking at a path now we need to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.319 
a point looking at a path now we need to
select<00:03:48.989> our<00:03:49.170> path<00:03:49.760> will<00:03:50.760> pick<00:03:50.940> our<00:03:51.090> line<00:03:51.299> that

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
select our path will pick our line that

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.610 
select our path will pick our line that
we<00:03:51.600> created<00:03:51.780> call<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.709> path<00:03:52.890> 1<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.390> ok<00:03:54.470> we<00:03:55.470> need

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
we created call it path 1 and ok we need

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.920 
we created call it path 1 and ok we need
to<00:03:55.709> pick<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:56.070> couple<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.610> settings<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.570> frame

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
to pick a couple of settings the frame

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.199 
to pick a couple of settings the frame
rate<00:03:58.200> which<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.739> typically<00:03:59.220> set<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.640> 30<00:03:59.880> frames

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
rate which is typically set to 30 frames

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.110 
rate which is typically set to 30 frames
per<00:04:00.630> second<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.769> will<00:04:01.920> take<00:04:02.100> 30<00:04:02.640> pictures

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
per second so it will take 30 pictures

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.600 
per second so it will take 30 pictures
per<00:04:03.480> second<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.140> your<00:04:04.350> movie<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.860> now<00:04:05.549> we

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.420 
per second for your movie and now we
have<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.239> number<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.660> frames<00:04:07.160> since<00:04:08.160> we<00:04:08.310> are

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
have the number of frames since we are

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.150 
have the number of frames since we are
at<00:04:08.519> 30<00:04:08.850> frames<00:04:09.060> per<00:04:09.540> second<00:04:10.079> if<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.709> do<00:04:10.860> 30

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
at 30 frames per second if we do 30

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.750 
at 30 frames per second if we do 30
frames<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:12.329> movie<00:04:12.660> will<00:04:12.840> last<00:04:13.049> one<00:04:13.410> second<00:04:13.950> so

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
frames the movie will last one second so

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.909 
frames the movie will last one second so
it<00:04:14.910> will<00:04:15.060> travel<00:04:15.390> along<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:16.229> length<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
it will travel along the length of the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.430 
it will travel along the length of the
entire<00:04:17.220> path<00:04:17.579> wait<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:18.000> one<00:04:18.030> second<00:04:18.630> that's<00:04:19.169> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
entire path wait in one second that's a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.620 
entire path wait in one second that's a
little<00:04:19.650> fast<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.250> what<00:04:20.400> we<00:04:20.549> want<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.030> so

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
little fast for what we want to do so

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.650 
little fast for what we want to do so
let's<00:04:22.560> call<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:22.979> five<00:04:23.340> seconds<00:04:23.880> just<00:04:24.060> for

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
let's call it five seconds just for

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.290 
let's call it five seconds just for
display<00:04:24.960> purposes<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:27.270> a

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
display purposes and you have a

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.230 
display purposes and you have a
resolution<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.860> larger<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.340> resolution<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
resolution the larger the resolution the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.600 
resolution the larger the resolution the
larger<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> movie<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.320> which<00:04:31.979> also<00:04:32.220> means

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
larger the movie is which also means

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.520 
larger the movie is which also means
it's<00:04:32.789> a<00:04:32.850> bigger<00:04:33.090> file<00:04:33.450> size<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.380> going

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
it's a bigger file size and it's going

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.219 
it's a bigger file size and it's going
to<00:04:34.680> take<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.010> lot<00:04:35.250> longer<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.760> render<00:04:36.229> for

of your friends now one problem we had

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.420 
of your friends now one problem we had
was<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.510> we<00:05:16.630> had<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> fixed<00:05:17.110> point<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.650> as<00:05:18.220> we

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
was that we had a fixed point and as we

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.270 
was that we had a fixed point and as we
were<00:05:18.580> at<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.210> fixed<00:05:19.660> point<00:05:19.870> right<00:05:20.770> here

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
were at this fixed point right here

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.240 
were at this fixed point right here
the<00:05:21.820> camera<00:05:22.210> turned<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:23.920> was<00:05:24.100> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
the camera turned and this was the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.029 
the camera turned and this was the
projection<00:05:24.850> view<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.180> we<00:05:25.300> saw

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
projection view that we saw

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.070 
projection view that we saw
now<00:05:27.669> it's<00:05:27.999> usually<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.419> little<00:05:28.659> bit<00:05:28.809> more

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
now it's usually a little bit more

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.309 
now it's usually a little bit more
exciting<00:05:29.650> when<00:05:30.009> we<00:05:30.129> use<00:05:30.369> our<00:05:30.729> movie<00:05:31.240> maker<00:05:31.479> if

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
exciting when we use our movie maker if

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.939 
exciting when we use our movie maker if
we<00:05:32.529> have<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.889> camera<00:05:33.369> go<00:05:33.610> along<00:05:33.969> the<00:05:34.150> pathway

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
we have the camera go along the pathway

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.559 
we have the camera go along the pathway
so<00:05:35.949> instead<00:05:36.249> of<00:05:36.309> a<00:05:36.430> point<00:05:36.639> let's<00:05:37.059> link<00:05:37.389> the

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
so instead of a point let's link the

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.640 
so instead of a point let's link the
camera<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.169> a<00:05:38.199> pathway

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.730 

call<00:05:42.040> a<00:05:42.070> path<00:05:42.370> one<00:05:42.699> and<00:05:42.940> then<00:05:43.780> we'll<00:05:44.020> target<00:05:44.590> or

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
call a path one and then we'll target or

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.400 
call a path one and then we'll target or
we'll<00:05:44.919> have<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.310> camera<00:05:45.729> pointed<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.080> point

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
we'll have the camera pointed to a point

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.340 
we'll have the camera pointed to a point
somewhere<00:05:47.919> in<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.220> center<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.729> house

we can turn that to a conceptual design
