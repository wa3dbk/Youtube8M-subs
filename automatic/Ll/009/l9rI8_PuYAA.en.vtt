00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
original theme and I am just going to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.590 
original theme and I am just going to
cut<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.890> hole<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.200> tail<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> thing

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
cut a hole in the tail of this thing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:02:03.780 
cut a hole in the tail of this thing
with<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:34.220> hole<00:01:35.220> saw<00:01:36.799> already<00:01:37.799> marked<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> out

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.450 

popping<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.230> will<00:02:05.380> be<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:06.250> got

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
popping and that will be that got

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.040 
popping and that will be that got
overlying<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.060> properly<00:02:09.210> but<00:02:10.210> that's

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
overlying that properly but that's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:21.480 
overlying that properly but that's
essentially<00:02:11.530> what's<00:02:12.010> gonna<00:02:12.160> look<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:20.490> it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
essentially what's gonna look like it's

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.540 
essentially what's gonna look like it's
not<00:02:21.550> typically<00:02:22.090> aligned<00:02:22.450> yet<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:23.550> yeah

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
not typically aligned yet but yeah

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.250 
not typically aligned yet but yeah
that's<00:02:26.910> that's<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
that's that's going to be it and the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.000 
that's that's going to be it and the
tail<00:02:29.500> isn't<00:02:29.830> aligned<00:02:30.220> right<00:02:30.430> now

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
tail isn't aligned right now

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.800 
tail isn't aligned right now
don't<00:02:33.010> scare<00:02:33.220> me<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:34.030> isn't<00:02:34.240> aligned

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
don't scare me and this isn't aligned

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.480 
don't scare me and this isn't aligned
it's<00:02:35.200> got<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.500> aligned<00:02:35.950> within<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> rubber

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
it's got to be aligned within the rubber

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.190 
it's got to be aligned within the rubber
bung<00:02:36.790> but<00:02:37.540> yeah<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:39.900> what<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.110> gonna

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
bung but yeah that's what it's gonna

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.730 
bung but yeah that's what it's gonna
look<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:42.660> dollar<00:02:43.660> ninety-nine<00:02:44.170> can't<00:02:44.620> go

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
look like dollar ninety-nine can't go

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.120 
look like dollar ninety-nine can't go
wrong

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
