hundred and ten pieces the bag itself is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.720 
hundred and ten pieces the bag itself is
pretty<00:00:25.109> small<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.010> instructions<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.519> only

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
pretty small the instructions are only

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.939 
pretty small the instructions are only
one<00:00:27.119> sheet<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.630> five<00:00:27.869> steps<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.769> there

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
one sheet and have five steps so there

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
one sheet and have five steps so there
is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> brick<00:00:29.820> placement<00:00:30.269> each<00:00:30.390> step

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
is a lot of brick placement each step

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.910 
is a lot of brick placement each step
and<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.170> where<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.470> lose<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> lot<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and this is where they lose a lot of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
and this is where they lose a lot of
points<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.149> tiny<00:00:33.390> pieces<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:33.989> difficult

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
points the tiny pieces can be difficult

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
points the tiny pieces can be difficult
to<00:00:34.530> handle<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.250> guess<00:00:35.520> that's<00:00:35.730> part<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to handle but I guess that's part of the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.930 
to handle but I guess that's part of the
fun<00:00:36.590> unlike<00:00:37.590> Legos<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.430> should<00:00:38.610> never<00:00:38.790> be

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
fun unlike Legos these should never be

put<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> carpet<00:00:39.629> as<00:00:39.750> they<00:00:39.930> will<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> lost

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
put on the carpet as they will get lost

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
put on the carpet as they will get lost
immediately<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.329> bricks<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.899> half<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
immediately the bricks are about half to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.380 
immediately the bricks are about half to
scale<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> Lego<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.850> still<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> same

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
scale the Lego and about still the same

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
scale the Lego and about still the same
height<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.110> cool<00:00:46.260> after

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
height so that's kind of cool after

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.560 
height so that's kind of cool after
about<00:00:47.219> 45<00:00:47.520> minutes<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> build<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
about 45 minutes to build time the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.150 
about 45 minutes to build time the
finished<00:00:48.840> product<00:00:49.079> looks<00:00:49.110> pretty<00:00:49.469> good<00:00:49.620> as

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
finished product looks pretty good as

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.410 
finished product looks pretty good as
you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.399> see<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.700> are<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> pieces

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you can see there are a lot of pieces

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920 
you can see there are a lot of pieces

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
pieces there tell me about it took me

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.289 
pieces there tell me about it took me
about<00:01:21.950> 45<00:01:22.549> minutes<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.330> build<00:01:23.630> mm-hmm<00:01:25.180> what<00:01:26.180> do

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
about 45 minutes to build mm-hmm what do

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.050 
about 45 minutes to build mm-hmm what do
you<00:01:26.360> think<00:01:26.479> about<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.049> instructions<00:01:28.060> very

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
you think about the instructions very

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.169 
you think about the instructions very
hard<00:01:29.420> very<00:01:29.840> hard<00:01:30.170> instructions<00:01:31.060> think<00:01:32.060> there

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
hard very hard instructions think there

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.090 
hard very hard instructions think there
should<00:01:32.330> be<00:01:32.360> more<00:01:32.420> pages<00:01:32.780> more<00:01:33.500> steps<00:01:33.770> um<00:01:36.100> so

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
should be more pages more steps um so

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.930 
should be more pages more steps um so
we're<00:01:37.220> gonna<00:01:37.340> do<00:01:37.399> with<00:01:37.520> all<00:01:37.580> these<00:01:37.700> extra

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
we're gonna do with all these extra

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.279 
we're gonna do with all these extra
pieces<00:01:38.350> hmm<00:01:39.580> maybe<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.610> can<00:01:40.909> make<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:41.289> Lego

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
pieces hmm maybe I can make a Lego

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.800 
pieces hmm maybe I can make a Lego
animation<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:43.220> like<00:01:44.030> some<00:01:44.240> little<00:01:44.450> kids

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
animation like like some little kids

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.289 
animation like like some little kids
building<00:01:45.259> with<00:01:45.409> Legos<00:01:45.799> ah<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.270> you

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
building with Legos ah so you can so you

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.330 
building with Legos ah so you can so you
can<00:01:47.539> make<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:47.929> Lego<00:01:48.289> guys<00:01:48.560> playing<00:01:49.190> with

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
can make your Lego guys playing with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
can make your Lego guys playing with
these<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.119> looks<00:01:50.569> like<00:01:50.630> they're<00:01:50.840> playing<00:01:51.020> with

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
these so looks like they're playing with

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.889 
these so looks like they're playing with
LEGOs<00:01:51.530> yeah<00:01:52.250> that's<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:52.940> good<00:01:53.090> idea<00:01:53.240> yeah

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
LEGOs yeah that's a good idea yeah

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.669 
LEGOs yeah that's a good idea yeah
that's<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.619> hold<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:56.500> yeah<00:01:57.500> let's

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
that's it you can hold on it yeah let's

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.649 
that's it you can hold on it yeah let's
see<00:01:57.890> since<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.700> got<00:01:58.909> we<00:01:59.899> got<00:01:59.929> this<00:02:00.170> guy<00:02:00.409> here

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
see since we got we got this guy here

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.690 
see since we got we got this guy here
yeah<00:02:02.659> definitely<00:02:03.439> uh<00:02:03.850> would<00:02:04.850> be<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.000> good<00:02:05.119> idea

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
yeah definitely uh would be a good idea

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.999 
yeah definitely uh would be a good idea
no<00:02:07.700> well<00:02:08.000> maybe<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.229> animation<00:02:09.799> should

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
no well maybe in your animation should

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.770 
no well maybe in your animation should
probably<00:02:10.280> call<00:02:10.429> mega<00:02:10.759> bloks<00:02:11.120> cuz<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.660> a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
