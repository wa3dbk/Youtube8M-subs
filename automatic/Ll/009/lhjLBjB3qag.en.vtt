00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
can go over to a tree and i can cut that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.160 
can go over to a tree and i can cut that
down<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.239> unfortunately<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.840> guy<00:00:34.110> killed

secondary one but they can't kill two
more<00:00:57.120> strong<00:00:57.420> units<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:57.930> added<00:00:58.199> later

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
more strong units will be added later

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
more strong units will be added later
this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.309> proof<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.640> concept<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.390> not

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this is just a proof of concept it's not

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
this is just a proof of concept it's not
really<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> beta<00:01:01.140> then<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.579> get

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
really a beta then I'm going to go get

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
really a beta then I'm going to go get
my<00:01:02.879> worker<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.140> chop<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> tree

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
my worker I'm going to go chop this tree

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.810 
my worker I'm going to go chop this tree
down<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.920> i'm<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> well

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
beta release i'm probably not going to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.160 
beta release i'm probably not going to
have<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> tool<00:01:30.299> i'm<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.480 

eventually<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> tool<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
eventually I'm going to have a tool to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
eventually I'm going to have a tool to
do<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.329> probably<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.200> change

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
do it it's probably going to be a change

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
do it it's probably going to be a change
of<00:01:40.740> cursor<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.970> click<00:01:42.000> on

something<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.369> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
something with it and you have that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.539 
something with it and you have that
cursor<00:01:45.030> equipped<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.950> it'll<00:01:46.950> destroy<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
cursor equipped it then it'll destroy it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.760 
things they've been going up because I
whoop<00:01:55.399> there<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.659> because<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.810> built<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
whoop there we go because I built the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.190 
whoop there we go because I built the
mine<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.670> farm<00:01:59.939> mines<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> fives<00:02:00.930> give

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
mine and the farm mines and fives give

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.530 
mine and the farm mines and fives give
plus<00:02:01.770> ten<00:02:02.070> resources<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.030> whatever<00:02:03.329> they're

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
plus ten resources for whatever they're

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
plus ten resources for whatever they're
doing<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:04.020> instance<00:02:04.290> mine<00:02:04.560> does<00:02:04.829> money<00:02:05.070> going

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
doing for instance mine does money going

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.760 
doing for instance mine does money going
to<00:02:05.700> switch<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.030> gold<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.540> farm<00:02:07.290> those<00:02:07.500> food

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
to switch it to gold and farm those food

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.050 
to switch it to gold and farm those food
because<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.330> food

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
because a you need food

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.730 
because a you need food
the<00:02:12.060> way<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.300> works<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.690> money<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.230> would<00:02:13.410> are

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the way it works is money and would are

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
the way it works is money and would are
taken<00:02:14.460> away<00:02:14.610> when<00:02:14.820> making<00:02:15.000> buildings<00:02:15.420> or

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
taken away when making buildings or

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 
taken away when making buildings or
buying<00:02:16.170> things<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> add<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> buying

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
buying things going to add the buying

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.570 
buying things going to add the buying
things<00:02:17.670> later<00:02:17.940> um<00:02:18.710> food<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.950> taken<00:02:20.250> away<00:02:20.310> when

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
things later um food is taken away when

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.490 
things later um food is taken away when
you<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:20.820> units<00:02:21.180> for<00:02:21.450> instance<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:22.050> average

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
you make units for instance an average

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
you make units for instance an average
unit<00:02:22.740> takes<00:02:23.070> five<00:02:23.370> food<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.450> created<00:02:24.690> an

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
unit takes five food I just created an

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.050 
unit takes five food I just created an
average<00:02:25.260> unit<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.800> yeah<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.340> took<00:02:26.490> five<00:02:26.790> away

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
average unit and yeah it took five away

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.830 
average unit and yeah it took five away
a<00:02:28.160> building<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.580> look<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.360> drops<00:02:30.690> 50<00:02:31.670> gold<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.830 

510<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.820> wood<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.030> probably

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
510 would I think and wood is probably

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.290 
510 would I think and wood is probably
the<00:02:40.020> longest<00:02:40.290> taking<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.160> get<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.850> takes<00:02:42.120> half

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the longest taking to get it takes half

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.530 
the longest taking to get it takes half
the<00:02:42.360> time<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.140> normal<00:02:43.860> resource<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the time as a normal resource to get it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020 
the time as a normal resource to get it
but<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> gives<00:02:46.440> half<00:02:46.710> them<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.130> much<00:02:47.550> always

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
but it gives half them as much always

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
but it gives half them as much always
and<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> live<00:02:48.960> if<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.170> have

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and you have to do it live if you have

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
and you have to do it live if you have
to<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:49.800> people<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.970> way<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.120> do

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
to do it with people and the way you do

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.990 
to do it with people and the way you do
it<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.630> workers<00:02:52.410> automatically<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.460> events

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
it is workers automatically do events

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200 
it is workers automatically do events
when<00:02:54.930> they<00:02:55.080> walk<00:02:55.320> into<00:02:55.560> them<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.880> can't

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
when they walk into them you can't

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.780 
when they walk into them you can't
select<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.350> say<00:02:58.530> hey<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.800> should<00:02:59.250> go<00:02:59.460> guilt

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
select and say hey you should go guilt

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.480 
select and say hey you should go guilt
build<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.360> base<00:03:00.600> halfway<00:03:01.170> across<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.710> map<00:03:01.890> they

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
build a base halfway across the map they

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.670 
build a base halfway across the map they
actually<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.240> have<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.600> walk<00:03:03.810> them<00:03:04.050> over<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
actually you have to walk them over to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.320 
actually you have to walk them over to
the<00:03:05.480> area<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.630> do<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:08.000> resources<00:03:09.000> are<00:03:09.120> done

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the area and do it resources are done

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.870 
the area and do it resources are done
automatically<00:03:10.310> automatically<00:03:11.310> collected

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
automatically automatically collected

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.850 
automatically automatically collected
into<00:03:12.120> your<00:03:12.540> stockpile<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.200> guess<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.710> could

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
into your stockpile I guess you could

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.190 
into your stockpile I guess you could
say<00:03:14.040> resources<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:18.180> enemies<00:03:18.660> will<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.840> added

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
say resources more enemies will be added

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.229 
say resources more enemies will be added
and<00:03:19.320> more<00:03:19.500> units<00:03:19.860> will<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.100> added<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.550> an

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and more units will be added and an

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.390 
and more units will be added and an
advanced<00:03:21.870> do<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.140> will<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.410> edit<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.830> maps<00:03:23.040> this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
advanced do I will be edit the maps this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
advanced do I will be edit the maps this
right<00:03:23.610> now<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.090> map<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:24.570> big<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:24.989> room

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
right now the map is as big as this room

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.340 
right now the map is as big as this room
however<00:03:25.830> I'm<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.670> be<00:03:26.760> making<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
however I'm going to be making it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.170 
however I'm going to be making it
probably<00:03:28.350> four<00:03:28.980> times<00:03:29.250> as<00:03:29.520> bigger<00:03:29.730> maybe

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
probably four times as bigger maybe

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.070 
probably four times as bigger maybe
bigger<00:03:30.570> than<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:32.420> eventual<00:03:33.420> goal<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
bigger than that and eventual goal is to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.740 
bigger than that and eventual goal is to
have<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> map<00:03:34.650> editor<00:03:34.890> too<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.360> can<00:03:36.450> make

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
have a map editor too so you can make

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.790 
have a map editor too so you can make
your<00:03:36.870> own<00:03:36.930> map<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:37.830> want<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.130> arm

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
your own map if you really want to arm

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.140 
your own map if you really want to arm
right<00:03:40.800> now<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.100> graphics<00:03:41.760> are<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> little

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
right now the graphics are a little

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.520 
right now the graphics are a little
buggy<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.600> they're<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.989> great<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.470> know

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
buggy and they're not that great I know

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.590 
buggy and they're not that great I know
that<00:03:43.830> they're<00:03:44.670> not<00:03:44.790> supposed<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.269> be<00:03:45.390> it's

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
that they're not supposed to be it's

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.949 
that they're not supposed to be it's
just<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> proof<00:03:46.140> of<00:03:46.260> concept<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:48.090> yeah<00:03:48.780> it's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
just a proof of concept and yeah it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.780 
just a proof of concept and yeah it's
just<00:03:49.110> basically<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.560> very<00:03:50.010> simple<00:03:50.430> real-time

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
just basically a very simple real-time

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.180 
just basically a very simple real-time
strategy<00:03:51.060> game<00:03:51.420> has<00:03:51.750> your<00:03:51.959> resources<00:03:52.500> has

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
strategy game has your resources has

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.759 
strategy game has your resources has
what<00:03:53.519> buildings<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.450> make<00:03:54.840> has<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
what buildings you can make has the
