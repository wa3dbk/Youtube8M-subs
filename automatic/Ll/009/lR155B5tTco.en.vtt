00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.459 
structure 74 inches long 16 inches wide
and<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> barrel<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> pretty<00:00:49.289> nice

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and and then the barrel a pretty nice

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
and and then the barrel a pretty nice
out<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> nice<00:00:50.070> deported<00:00:50.579> we're<00:00:51.030> gonna<00:00:51.120> run

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
out in a nice deported we're gonna run

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
out in a nice deported we're gonna run
in<00:00:51.600> between<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> support<00:00:52.500> beam<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> 16<00:00:53.670> inches

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in between a support beam of 16 inches

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
in between a support beam of 16 inches
just<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.780> between<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.680> barrels<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.250> over

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
just in between the barrels right over

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
just in between the barrels right over
here<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.300> support<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.410> gonna

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
here to for support and then we're gonna

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
here to for support and then we're gonna
put<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.770> legs<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.699> right<00:00:59.820> now<00:00:59.879> we're

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
put some legs on it but right now we're

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
put some legs on it but right now we're
just<00:01:00.300> determining<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:02.039> space<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.619> lose

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
just determining how much space we lose

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.820 
just determining how much space we lose
how<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.920> space<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.309> need<00:01:05.489> before<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.830> put

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
how much space we need before we put

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.000 
how much space we need before we put
them<00:01:07.950> together<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.820> seems<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:13.010> they're

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
them together so it seems like they're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
them together so it seems like they're
by<00:01:14.189> writer<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> go<00:01:14.970> along<00:01:15.150> because

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
we're all short on this piece of wood do

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
we're all short on this piece of wood do
a<00:01:17.369> stuffing<00:01:17.729> stick<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> together<00:01:18.290> or<00:01:19.290> cut<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
couple more pieces that's that space

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.790 
couple more pieces that's that space
measure<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.650 

how<00:01:27.800> much<00:01:27.950> 40<00:01:28.430> 40<00:01:29.890> 45<00:01:30.890> or<00:01:31.190> 43<00:01:31.760> let's<00:01:32.390> see<00:01:32.510> what

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
how much 40 40 45 or 43 let's see what

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.330 
how much 40 40 45 or 43 let's see what
45<00:01:33.110> looks<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:34.600> measure<00:01:35.600> from<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.560> one<00:01:36.770> from

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
45 looks like measure from this one from

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.620 
45 looks like measure from this one from
the<00:01:37.460> end<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.000> end<00:01:38.120> of<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.300> one

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.320 

43<00:01:44.630> 5<00:01:44.990> 43<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.770> think<00:01:46.280> we're<00:01:46.370> gonna<00:01:46.460> go<00:01:46.580> about<00:01:46.730> 43

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
43 5 43 I think we're gonna go about 43

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.640 
43 5 43 I think we're gonna go about 43
because<00:01:47.510> it'll<00:01:47.780> give<00:01:47.900> us<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> little<00:01:48.200> space<00:01:48.350> and

chefs go 45 then we have enough words we

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.590 
chefs go 45 then we have enough words we
need<00:01:55.190> two<00:01:55.340> pieces<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:55.790> 45<00:01:56.240> each<00:01:56.450> we

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
need two pieces of with 45 each we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.300 
need two pieces of with 45 each we
should<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.950> then<00:01:58.130> we're<00:01:58.220> gonna
