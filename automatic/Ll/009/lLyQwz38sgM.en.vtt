player and the sandpile posing for a
picture<00:02:00.450> sweet<00:02:01.450> one<00:02:02.380> thing<00:02:02.590> we<00:02:02.829> are

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
picture sweet one thing we are

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130 
picture sweet one thing we are
constantly<00:02:03.369> thinking<00:02:03.880> about<00:02:03.999> is<00:02:04.359> how<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:05.049> we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
constantly thinking about is how can we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.349 
constantly thinking about is how can we
prevent<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.859> player<00:02:06.039> from<00:02:06.159> just<00:02:06.609> leaving<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
prevent the player from just leaving the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.630 
prevent the player from just leaving the
map<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:07.780> his<00:02:07.899> telekinetic<00:02:08.289> powers<00:02:08.890> after

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
map with his telekinetic powers after

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
map with his telekinetic powers after
all<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.940> could<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.269> make<00:02:10.509> stairs<00:02:10.899> by

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
all you could just make stairs by

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.950 
all you could just make stairs by
levitating<00:02:11.680> rocks<00:02:12.129> like<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.940> do<00:02:13.000> here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
levitating rocks like I do here

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.540 
levitating rocks like I do here
and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.620> first<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.310> go

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and then take the first one and go

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.850 
and then take the first one and go
higher<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:15.940> higher<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.630> higher<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.710> this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
higher and higher and higher so this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.320 
higher and higher and higher so this
limitation<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.700> try<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> implement

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
limitation that we try to implement

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.180 
limitation that we try to implement
should<00:02:19.660> somehow<00:02:19.900> feel<00:02:20.200> natural<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.830> not<00:02:21.010> like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
should somehow feel natural and not like

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.670 
should somehow feel natural and not like
a<00:02:21.220> synthetic<00:02:21.820> barrier<00:02:22.210> of<00:02:22.330> course<00:02:22.680> currently

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a synthetic barrier of course currently

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.340 
a synthetic barrier of course currently
we<00:02:23.860> are<00:02:23.890> experimenting<00:02:24.460> with<00:02:25.350> concentration

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we are experimenting with concentration

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.860 
we are experimenting with concentration
you<00:02:27.100> cannot<00:02:27.340> concentrate<00:02:27.940> while<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.600> stand

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you cannot concentrate while you stand

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.710 
you cannot concentrate while you stand
on<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> moving<00:02:29.470> object<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:31.210> all

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
on a moving object so if you get up all

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.140 
on a moving object so if you get up all
your<00:02:32.170> rocks<00:02:32.440> will<00:02:32.740> fall<00:02:32.980> down<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.910> cannot

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
your rocks will fall down you cannot

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240 
your rocks will fall down you cannot
keep<00:02:34.360> rocks<00:02:34.720> levitating<00:02:35.560> when<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.860> cannot

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
keep rocks levitating when you cannot

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.760 
keep rocks levitating when you cannot
concentrate<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.240> have<00:02:37.840> no<00:02:38.050> solid<00:02:38.320> ground

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
concentrate and have no solid ground

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.770 
concentrate and have no solid ground
under<00:02:38.920> your<00:02:39.100> feet<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> test

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
under your feet this is just the test

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.870 
under your feet this is just the test
though<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.740> have<00:02:41.920> some<00:02:42.130> good<00:02:42.280> ideas<00:02:42.640> how

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
though do you have some good ideas how

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.380 
though do you have some good ideas how
to<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.210> that<00:02:43.390> let<00:02:43.960> us<00:02:44.050> know<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.410> comments

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to do that let us know in the comments
