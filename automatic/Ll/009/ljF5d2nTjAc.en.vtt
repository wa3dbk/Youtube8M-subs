00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.679

interference screen stopped working so
if<00:00:30.090> you're<00:00:30.330> near<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> power<00:00:30.779> source<00:00:31.140> some

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
if you're near a power source some

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.970 
if you're near a power source some
reason<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:33.360> screen<00:00:33.690> goes<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.590 

take<00:00:40.980> away<00:00:41.010> our<00:00:41.370> power<00:00:41.579> source<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:44.600> cheese

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
take away our power source and cheese

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.900 
take away our power source and cheese
all<00:00:46.050> ok

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.270 

okay<00:00:53.780> maybe<00:00:54.200> not<00:00:54.440> no<00:00:55.450> she<00:00:56.450> gets<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:57.220> but<00:00:58.220> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
okay maybe not no she gets there but I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.240 
okay maybe not no she gets there but I
do<00:00:58.370> think<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:58.820> uh<00:00:59.770> there's<00:01:00.770> something<00:01:00.920> wrong

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
do think that uh there's something wrong

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.340 
do think that uh there's something wrong
with<00:01:01.520> these<00:01:01.640> units<00:01:02.360> straight<00:01:02.930> out<00:01:03.020> of<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.140> box

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
with these units straight out of the box

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.350 
with these units straight out of the box
and<00:01:03.620> they're<00:01:04.220> actually<00:01:04.370> interacting<00:01:05.150> with

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
and they're actually interacting with

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.430 
and they're actually interacting with
the<00:01:07.660> field<00:01:08.660> that's<00:01:08.870> coming<00:01:09.200> out<00:01:09.260> of<00:01:09.320> our<00:01:11.440> you

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
the field that's coming out of our you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.660 
the field that's coming out of our you
here<00:01:13.190> now<00:01:13.340> fairly<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:13.970> have<00:01:14.619> 250<00:01:15.619> or<00:01:15.920> 240<00:01:16.430> volt

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
here now fairly we have 250 or 240 volt

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.190 
here now fairly we have 250 or 240 volt
or<00:01:16.970> 220<00:01:17.570> some<00:01:17.750> people<00:01:18.080> call<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.020> do<00:01:21.170> have

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
or 220 some people call it so we do have

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.960 
or 220 some people call it so we do have
a<00:01:21.410> lot<00:01:21.590> more<00:01:21.770> radiation<00:01:22.130> coming<00:01:22.610> out<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.820> these

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
a lot more radiation coming out of these

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.219 
a lot more radiation coming out of these
other<00:01:23.420> cables<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.020> think<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.960> just

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
other cables and think that it just

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.620 
other cables and think that it just
seems<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:27.710> quite<00:01:29.110> intermittent<00:01:30.940> if<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.240> if

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
seems to be quite intermittent if you if

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.900 
seems to be quite intermittent if you if
we<00:01:32.750> walk<00:01:32.960> away<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.979> see<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> further<00:01:37.580> away<00:01:37.759> we

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
we walk away and see the further away we

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.969 
we walk away and see the further away we
seem<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.390> get<00:01:38.509> any<00:01:38.690> from<00:01:38.930> from<00:01:39.530> any<00:01:39.680> sort<00:01:39.920> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
seem to get any from from any sort of

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.810 
seem to get any from from any sort of
power<00:01:40.820> source<00:01:41.440> screen<00:01:42.440> seems<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.860> work<00:01:43.070> start

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
power source screen seems to work start

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:54.010 
power source screen seems to work start
working<00:01:44.090> properly<00:01:50.560> get<00:01:51.560> close<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.220> I<00:01:53.020> just

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
working properly get close to one I just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.760 
working properly get close to one I just
switched<00:01:54.229> on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.619> main<00:01:55.009> switch<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.619> you

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
switched on the main switch and and you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.620 
switched on the main switch and and you
can<00:01:58.160> see<00:01:58.310> I'm<00:01:58.429> trying<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.849> swipe<00:01:59.090> properly

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
can see I'm trying to swipe properly
