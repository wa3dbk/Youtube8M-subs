00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.799
 or mask a part that touches our 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.809
 mapita 3 of the world or not so let's go 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.700
 there, yes, there are enough 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.189
 chances of falling over kill yourself or 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.630
 as you mean more than anything 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.390
 because there are precipices and where there 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 precipices there are homicidal tendencies of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.519
 suicide is like that mathematical in question 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 game on anything so let's go to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.439
 go up here because there's a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 little star and also this way we fall 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.350
 crazy over and over we fall 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.879
 over sometimes it sounds weird from another 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 star what happens is that here I go to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 have to turn a little before if not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 I will not not get a hit I put 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.479
 but very far to see what goes on horn 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.540
 because always in half champion to see 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.640
 whoever profits there are a lot of flowers 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.229
 fire what's happening is that you looked you know 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.839
 we always have a flower of fire 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.360
 well, since it does not do anything else 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.670
 to give us as typical the typical of 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.409
 the games of mario thousand points that we are going 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 that to which the points interest him 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 because it comes well from pearls that here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.719
 balls of pearls 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.700
 you have a bit of luck with 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.610
 all 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.810
 a little more and slides there to the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.189
 Infinity and beyond 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.469
 well at least we've got two 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.409
 stars that yes that it is possible to say that this 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.009
 map the stars are very followed and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.179
 Admittedly, that's a joy 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.179
 fuck to die or fuck the mushroom 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.039
 dt 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 one of these maps that there is a 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.210
 possibility of falling so big that it gives 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 even fear but good that it is going to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 do this which is the third and then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.229
 the fuck was then I was going 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.229
 it was almost at the end 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.760
 and there we are stuck a good mushroom not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.330
 it is of more then if we take some other 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.670
 box that has skills because no 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.000
 will drop there we are 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 the peep god god in this game 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.520
 many of the maps is them enough 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.350
 possible to reach the tip of the flag 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.580
 or is that 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.620
 I think this is going to be the first exchange or 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.660
 not if the first swap of stars 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.370
 let's open it go through here costs 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.709
 five star coins that is when you spend 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 seven o'clock and this we say we're not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.840
 the stars that we have managed to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.800
 access mushrooms or routes shortcuts and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.380
 the rest 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.640
 the issue is that neither as I told you 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.019
 the previous part has not passed me the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.760
 game but I'm going to prepare it and 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.340
 all the roll what happens I do not know if 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.340
 in some future it will serve us of something 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.200
 the stars I hope not 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.370
 so at least we get about three or 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.659
 four lives 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.659
 look what blocks 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.970
 to taking a sack that is very common in 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.220
 my ordering it in a bad way in those 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.700
 maps but good that should be done well 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.930
 that now touches us in the first tower 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.579
 remind you that this is the tower and not the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.739
 castle that the castle then comes 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.560
 then to see one of these two will be 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.040
 fire plant that we will need with a 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 book yes there is the bad of the game is 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.989
 that you can not kill the skeletons 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.609
 but well, nothing happens, I'm going to 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.400
 worry more than not my pachu rehn 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.160
 in a bad way and well I think that with 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.099
 I survived that everything will be fine 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.610
 I believe everything everything absolutely everything 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.020
 it will be fine 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.490
 I do not like this kind of castles 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.190
 because the possibility that they have 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.170
 office and raid is so big that mother 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.300
 mine 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.780
 if the first ones are very easy and 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:57.480
 simply because you are attentive 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.990
 that yes that was in this map in 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.660
 concrete there is a secret exit the 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.760
 problem guys is that you need a 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.560
 special ability that is the nothing else is 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.560
 a special measure of this game that is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.690
 the shell horn and with the shell 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.320
 Why shell horn sounds a bit 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.239
 good but of course if we do not have happiness 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.940
 ability we can not open us change 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.040
 not the one to take the exit , you know that 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.419
 the secret exits are normally 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.419
 cannons that send us 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.620
 but what the hell presents the port 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.270
 nervous 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.950
 We are here as I told you, Bolivia 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.930
 thousands of times because good is normal is 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.820
 a game of this is that you kill yourself and 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.000
 as I am talking about a thousand things because 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.480
 they spend what they house and the truth is that they do not 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.390
 I complain 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.880
 so they get longer to see this what 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.210
 happens is that fuck if you're not chiquitito 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.030
 you're like very just now now we 're going to 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.860
 go down to we put it in the pipeline more than 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.420
 nothing is going to catch the flip coins and 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.250
 the last one we're going to get into this 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.900
 little door that is the last star and 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.240
 above is the exit that the 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.340
 we will use we will advance a little bit more 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.470
 for the castle and such but let's go for 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.110
 today please your mother you were 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.660
 I slipped and between the Fridays nothing 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.820
 come on that yes this is the world 1 a map 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.010
 3 or map four planes so this is already the 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.200
 map 4 I really shit in the milk 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.340
 I do not want to think when I get the endorsement 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.340
 is that it will not lead you to that 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.150
 Y 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.000
 what happens is that you have to have a 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.640
 careful these parts the grandmother milk what 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.210
 bad is that I will not come with a flower 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.850
 I play the boss and that's going to be a bit 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.010
 The worst is because it will cost us 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.210
 a little more 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.420
 it's simply going to cost us a little 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.950
 more kill the boss 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.360
 and there we can have a jump here 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.550
 and we mess with here and this is the 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.440
 exit the problem is that here 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.650
 we need in the horn shell for 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.390
 do not run bounces pam pam pam pam pam and 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.040
 it seems that there were a few walls 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.750
 walls along the way that you could just 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.090
 break with the shell because it 's in 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.129
 horizontal line and you do not have another 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:18.599
 I hope you do not pay me 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:20.399
 It's perfect to see here, let's go down and 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.459
 let's catch the mushroom more than anything 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.989
 to make sure that they are minimal and 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:27.300
 be gps in this as always is usually 

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:30.449
 the boss is very easy but there's never 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.909
 to trust them you'll see 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.989
 of the machorras banespa churras for 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:40.160
 office scrapes and so normally it is 

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:43.550
 they become easy bosses but 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.530
 good that is done in the seas not 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.940
 you can ask for a lot with the bosses and 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.510
 that this game is specifically focused 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.360
 on the platform, that's the least bad thing 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.430
 the following ones that came out mario galaxy 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.110
 all development they did quite 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.360
 well on platforms and bosses although 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.040
 not to shoot rockets but there it is 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.870
 the thing and thank you thank and we left 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.370
 of the castillito and we cut here guys already 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.590
 I know it's a very short video but it's that 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.420
 you will understand that if he has killed me like 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.370
 15 times on two imaginary maps and 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:18.940
 prepare three hours are easy but 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.940
 then you will see up to 30 minutes 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.360
 else matters little so the people 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.250
 short here I hope you liked it and 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.960
 If so , you already know how to subscribe 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.710
 and those important autonomous things 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.160
 thank you for following me goodbye to be happy 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.160
 here
