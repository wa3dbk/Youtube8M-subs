00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:14.250
 the law stuck in the past the hint 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.800
 today because it's a super powerful mask 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.080
 to lighten the skin know if the spots 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 from melasma this marchinha that usually 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 walking in this region here in london 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 they usually appear as 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.650
 time after 25 years to there or 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.359
 after a gestation during a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 gestation usually those specks in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.219
 skin to fight the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.300
 Today's tip will be a super mask 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.879
 efficient 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 wants to know how to communicate because 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.890
 It works, just stay with me for this. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.410
 we will need green clay 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 physiological saline but it can be 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 substituted by either filtered water or 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.480
 mineral and the cat is on the milk 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 of magnesia to make very simple 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 Do you need a spoonful of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 plastic because an aluminum spoon 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 it can alter the composition of public areas 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.809
 dilate as my spoon inha escaped 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.909
 if 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.670
 A gentleman has gone, I'm going to use this 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 from here you get the equivalent of a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.340
 spoon and this does not have a box by hand 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.530
 It is better that a metal spoon can and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:23.100
 a little sleep enough to obey 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 leave the clay well grind I'll stir 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.369
 with this potential even looks and finally 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.579
 I'll use a little milk of 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.119
 magnesia that also helps the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.189
 clear unless the study also 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.700
 until you achieve consistency. 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.009
 homogeneous and so is ready for our 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 mask before applying the mask is 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.360
 need to make a choice are in the skin 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.340
 This to make things very clean. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 without any dead cell ready for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060
 receive the mass 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.729
 I chose 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 exploration and always in the most of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.759
 in this way with bicarbonate of 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.909
 sodium 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.420
 This is because it has an alkaline pH 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.580
 that it regulates the ph of the skin to take 10 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.830
 for the exploration I separated a little bit 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.860
 of the championship in the same hand places the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.170
 dripping water to soften a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.530
 little and it will stay like this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 This peace had china will get here in the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.130
 fear and applying those who suffer 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
 it is very good to do this. 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.560
 connection with bicarbonate daily 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 because he is a little Brazil is not 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.160
 fight the skin 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 it goes far beyond being an action 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.940
 anti-inflammatory 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.130
 I chose for two minutes or so. 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.110
 Rinse well with plenty of water until you 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.900
 feel that to modify the decision 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.170
 well she gave a taste, now let's go 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.769
 for the application of the mask we made 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.620
 there because it will need a brush 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.160
 so do not be afraid for fear 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 same 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.900
 The important thing is to apply the mask whenever 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.200
 O well up this super right mask 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.190
 fast and this time you are 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.940
 using 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.329
 can not always speak the movement 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.390
 out and up 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.780
 We're like Jack London these guys. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 masks 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.100
 This dough is right, I'll go quickly. 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:34.329
 accelerate here and she 's pulling 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.329
 pulls a lot 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:45.490
 after finishing the publication 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.360
 you stay in Estadinho that had there is 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.370
 a debt does not keep on moving 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.209
 or close to a lot of quality 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.620
 if you can do will make the preferential 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.030
 night before bed is even better 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.209
 do not apply in the eye region 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.310
 nor here in the mouth very close to occur 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.239
 I've never gotten close too well it's a good one. 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.459
 I do not even have my application 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.530
 That's the mask, I'll be quiet there. 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.049
 I can not talk to him in the meantime. 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.880
 because she resource that can play as 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.760
 If you have a good pair of sequins 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.800
 only along well with pure water is shown 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.260
 has the whitening effect of the proposal 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.280
 this video but also with low 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.280
 oiliness 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.380
 there is rejuvenation because it gives 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.110
 firmness on the skin gives a 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.120
 lifting even when washing bear take off 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.610
 But, man, we already feel good skin. 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.520
 pulled out after removing the mask is 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.229
 primary hydration to leave 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.410
 dry skin even if you have skin 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.780
 should be graded with a 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.940
 oil-free product 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.140
 the sample can be applied one to two 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.360
 Times a week 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.120
 who have rather oily skin or are 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.380
 with that or suffer with acne can do 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.060
 twice a week 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.669
 who has normal skin but the same 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.340
 cleared once the skin is already 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.440
 enough then is this girls this 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.750
 my tip hope you like it like that 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.220
 use and then correct the 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.590
 All right, all right.
