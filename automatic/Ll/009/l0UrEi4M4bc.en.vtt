here it goes alright that's how it looks
you<00:00:58.260> push<00:00:58.530> start<00:00:58.829> obviously<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.579> X<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you push start obviously with X or the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.460 
you push start obviously with X or the
start<00:01:00.600> button<00:01:01.129> ok<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.520> X<00:01:03.170> it<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.320> be
