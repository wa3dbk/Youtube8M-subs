00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
it if you if you get a text at a texture

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.580 
it if you if you get a text at a texture
pack<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.940> default<00:03:24.450> minecraft<00:03:24.630> graphics

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
pack it was default minecraft graphics

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.740 
pack it was default minecraft graphics
but<00:03:25.710> it<00:03:25.800> was<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.400> was<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.700> high<00:03:26.880> resolution<00:03:27.600> and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
but it was it was in high resolution and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.450 
but it was it was in high resolution and
i<00:03:28.140> had<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> shader<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> computer<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.370> i

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
i had a shader on the computer because i

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.700 
i had a shader on the computer because i
got<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.790> pc<00:03:30.150> also<00:03:30.720> got<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.050> ps4<00:03:31.320> as<00:03:31.560> well

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
got it on a pc also got on a ps4 as well

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.820 
got it on a pc also got on a ps4 as well
but<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:33.540> looks<00:03:33.870> pretty<00:03:33.990> good<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.740> if

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
but it looks pretty good so I think if

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.020 
but it looks pretty good so I think if
you<00:03:34.920> made<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.130> game<00:03:35.400> look<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:35.850> better

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030

put some lighting in it you know could a
shader<00:03:38.610> on<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.420> could<00:03:39.600> sell<00:03:39.840> minecraft

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260
