crystal and you can see from this angle
that<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.010> very<00:03:05.280> flat<00:03:05.639> compared<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
that it's very flat compared to the

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.569 
that it's very flat compared to the
concave<00:03:06.719> iPhone<00:03:07.049> 5<00:03:07.319> home<00:03:07.560> button<00:03:07.889> now<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.459> also

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
concave iPhone 5 home button now it also

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.979

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
has this ring around the button that's

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.599 
has this ring around the button that's
used<00:03:10.169> to<00:03:10.290> activate<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.010> sensor<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.459> you're

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
used to activate this sensor that you're

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.399 
used to activate this sensor that you're
going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.879> using<00:03:12.209> for<00:03:12.239> touch<00:03:12.689> ID<00:03:12.959> and

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
going to be using for touch ID and

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.890 
going to be using for touch ID and
fingerprint<00:03:14.069> scanning<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.969> when<00:03:15.329> pressing<00:03:15.629> it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
fingerprint scanning so when pressing it

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.780 
fingerprint scanning so when pressing it
it<00:03:15.989> feels<00:03:16.290> similar<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.949> iPhone<00:03:17.280> 5<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.699> it

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it feels similar to the iPhone 5 but it

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.699 
it feels similar to the iPhone 5 but it
doesn't<00:03:18.000> have<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> exact<00:03:18.599> same<00:03:18.659> click<00:03:19.229> it's

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
doesn't have the exact same click it's

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.339 
doesn't have the exact same click it's
more<00:03:19.949> of<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.159> muffled<00:03:20.699> press<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.329> you<00:03:21.449> will<00:03:21.659> I'm

more of a muffled press if you will I'm
really<00:03:22.680> excited<00:03:22.919> to<00:03:23.099> setup<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> touch<00:03:23.609> ID<00:03:23.819> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
really excited to setup the touch ID and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.580 
really excited to setup the touch ID and
see<00:03:24.299> how<00:03:24.419> well<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.659> works<00:03:26.900> now<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.439> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
see how well it works now here on the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
mic and the new dual LED flash which is

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
mic and the new dual LED flash which is
going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.859> hopefully<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:36.000> haven't<00:03:36.479> tested<00:03:36.599> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
going to hopefully I haven't tested it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.050 
going to hopefully I haven't tested it
yet<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.040> make<00:03:38.310> your<00:03:38.549> pictures<00:03:38.970> come

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
yet but going to make your pictures come

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.999 
yet but going to make your pictures come
out<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.389> whole<00:03:39.720> lot<00:03:39.930> better<00:03:40.139> by<00:03:40.439> matching<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:41.009 
out a whole lot better by matching the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.530 
out a whole lot better by matching the
flash<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> color<00:03:41.819> temperature<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.419> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
flash with the color temperature of the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.349 
flash with the color temperature of the
room<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.560> let's<00:03:43.919> flip<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.310> back<00:03:44.459> over<00:03:44.819> here<00:03:45.090> and

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
room so let's flip it back over here and

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.490 
room so let's flip it back over here and
you'll<00:03:46.139> be<00:03:46.319> able<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.650> see<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:48.329> new<00:03:48.569> color<00:03:49.079> of

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
you'll be able to see the new color of

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.890 
you'll be able to see the new color of
space<00:03:50.069> gray<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.729> all<00:03:51.150> its<00:03:51.389> glory

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
space gray in all its glory

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.710 
space gray in all its glory
I<00:03:52.079> think<00:03:52.979> it<00:03:53.069> looks<00:03:53.280> really<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.790> nice<00:03:54.329> so

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
I think it looks really really nice so

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
I think it looks really really nice so
here<00:03:55.439> I<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.769> black<00:03:55.979> iPhone<00:03:56.430> 5<00:03:56.669> in<00:03:56.909> my

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
here I have the black iPhone 5 in my

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.199 
here I have the black iPhone 5 in my
left<00:03:57.269> hand<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.259> Space<00:03:58.680> Gray<00:03:59.159> iPhone<00:03:59.669> 5<00:03:59.909> in

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
left hand and the Space Gray iPhone 5 in

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.119 
left hand and the Space Gray iPhone 5 in
my<00:04:00.359> right<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.229> if<00:04:01.349> we<00:04:01.470> put<00:04:01.680> them<00:04:01.799> both<00:04:01.949> together

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
my right so if we put them both together

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.189 
my right so if we put them both together
you<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.639> see<00:04:02.909> that<00:04:03.180> these<00:04:03.299> definitely<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.049> a

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
you can see that these definitely have a

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.050 
you can see that these definitely have a
completely<00:04:04.799> different<00:04:05.009> color<00:04:05.459> looking<00:04:05.970> at

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
completely different color looking at
