in<00:00:10.380> order<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:11.219> survive<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.940> thrive<00:00:12.090> in

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
in order to really survive and thrive in

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.330 
in order to really survive and thrive in
space<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:13.290> need<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> make<00:00:13.650> things<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.070> space

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
space we need to make things in space

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.480 
space we need to make things in space
and<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.719> 3d<00:00:16.230> printing<00:00:16.890> or<00:00:17.100> additive

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and so the 3d printing or additive

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.240 
and so the 3d printing or additive
manufacturing<00:00:17.900> technology<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.250> really

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
manufacturing technology is really

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
manufacturing technology is really
perfect<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.750> need<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
perfect because all you need to do is

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890 
perfect because all you need to do is
have<00:00:22.590> feedstock<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.359> send<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
have feedstock and then you can send the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.890 
have feedstock and then you can send the
files<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.619> send<00:00:25.920> zero<00:00:26.670> mass<00:00:27.000> into<00:00:27.390> space<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
files you send zero mass into space you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.320 
files you send zero mass into space you
send<00:00:28.170> bits<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.800> bytes<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.310> space<00:00:29.670> digital

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
send bits and bytes into space digital

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.799 
send bits and bytes into space digital
information<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.130> make<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.090> parts

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
information and then you make the parts

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.080 
information and then you make the parts
and<00:00:34.079> objects<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.219> destination<00:00:35.430> using

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and objects at the destination using

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.319 
and objects at the destination using
local<00:00:36.600> materials<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.280> 3d<00:00:38.730> print<00:00:39.090> at

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
local materials we want to 3d print at

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
local materials we want to 3d print at
any<00:00:39.840> destination<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.730> official

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
any destination we go to the official

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.889 
any destination we go to the official
destination<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.170> NASA<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.100> Mars<00:00:44.660> we're<00:00:45.660> going

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
destination for NASA is Mars we're going

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.029 
destination for NASA is Mars we're going
to<00:00:46.020> Mars<00:00:46.940> moon<00:00:47.940> maybe<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.809> waypoint<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.950> way

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to Mars moon maybe a waypoint on the way

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.580 
to Mars moon maybe a waypoint on the way
to<00:00:50.100> Mars<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> asteroids<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> waypoint

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to Mars and asteroids maybe a waypoint

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.490 
to Mars and asteroids maybe a waypoint
on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> way<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> Mars<00:00:53.960> fortunately<00:00:54.960> these

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
on the way to Mars fortunately these

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260 
on the way to Mars fortunately these
planetary<00:00:56.070> surfaces<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.760> covered<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
planetary surfaces are covered with a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.020 
planetary surfaces are covered with a
common<00:00:57.750> material<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> basalt<00:00:59.039> assault

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
common material which is basalt assault

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
common material which is basalt assault
is<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> mineral<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.219> minerals

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
is a mineral and we have other minerals

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
is a mineral and we have other minerals
in<00:01:02.850> space<00:01:03.149> too<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.930> example<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> moon

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
in space too so for example on the moon

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.760 
in space too so for example on the moon
the<00:01:04.949> lunar<00:01:05.070> regolith<00:01:05.519> has<00:01:05.700> 42%<00:01:06.560> oxygen<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the lunar regolith has 42% oxygen and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
the lunar regolith has 42% oxygen and
that's<00:01:08.400> silica<00:01:09.210> oxide<00:01:09.240> titanium<00:01:09.930> oxide

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's silica oxide titanium oxide

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.510 
that's silica oxide titanium oxide
calcium<00:01:11.220> oxide<00:01:12.030> magnesium<00:01:12.750> oxide<00:01:13.619> iron<00:01:13.920> oxide

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
calcium oxide magnesium oxide iron oxide

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.899 
calcium oxide magnesium oxide iron oxide
so<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.900> trick<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> separate<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.400> metals

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so the trick is to separate the metals

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.870 
so the trick is to separate the metals
from<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> oxides<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.710> separate<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> oxygen

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
from the oxides we separate the oxygen

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.510 
from the oxides we separate the oxygen
from<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.900> metals<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.159> breathing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
from the metals and we have breathing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.170 
from the metals and we have breathing
air<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> waste<00:01:25.320> product<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.670> feedstock

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
air the waste product is your feedstock

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.340 
air the waste product is your feedstock
for<00:01:27.390> making<00:01:27.810> parts<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.060> no<00:01:30.240> waste<00:01:30.509> we

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
for making parts so we have no waste we

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
for making parts so we have no waste we
have<00:01:31.470> free<00:01:31.740> energy<00:01:32.100> from<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> Sun<00:01:32.869> all<00:01:33.869> we

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
have free energy from the Sun all we

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.940 
have free energy from the Sun all we
need<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> ingenuity<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.790> expertise<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
need is the ingenuity and expertise of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.020 
need is the ingenuity and expertise of
designing<00:01:37.950> these<00:01:38.130> machines<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> will

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
designing these machines that will

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.710 
designing these machines that will
extract<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> oxygen<00:01:40.170> extract<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> metals

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
extract the oxygen extract the metals

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
extract the oxygen extract the metals
make<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> metals<00:01:43.200> into<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> feedstock<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
make the metals into a feedstock like a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.240 
make the metals into a feedstock like a
powder<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> 3d<00:01:46.110> printer<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> part

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
powder use a 3d printer to make a part

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.440 
powder use a 3d printer to make a part
and<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.649> self-sustaining

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
and now we're have a self-sustaining

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
and now we're have a self-sustaining
civilization<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:52.020> outer<00:01:52.200> space<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.130> we're

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
civilization in outer space so we're

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
civilization in outer space so we're
developing<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:54.210> variety<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.200> different

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
developing a variety of different

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.819 
developing a variety of different
robotic<00:01:56.009> tools<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.000> mechanisms<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.829> excavate

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
robotic tools and mechanisms to excavate

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
robotic tools and mechanisms to excavate
the<00:01:59.159> regolith<00:01:59.700> regular<00:02:00.180> there's<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the regolith regular there's this

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
the regolith regular there's this
crushed<00:02:00.810> assault<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> covers<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
crushed assault that covers the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.560 
crushed assault that covers the
planetary<00:02:02.250> surfaces<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
planetary surfaces so we're going to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
planetary surfaces so we're going to
excavate<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.140> Regulus<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:04.920> transport

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
excavate the Regulus and then transport

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
excavate the Regulus and then transport
it<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> processing<00:02:06.630> plant<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it to a processing plant and then that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.559 
it to a processing plant and then that
processing<00:02:08.550> plant<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:09.030> extract<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
processing plant can extract the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
processing plant can extract the
resources<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> make<00:02:11.250> feedstock<00:02:11.849> there's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
resources and make feedstock there's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.250 
resources and make feedstock there's
billions<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> billions<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
billions and billions of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.929 
billions and billions of
times<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.560> resources<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.069> outer<00:02:14.189> space<00:02:14.280> than

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
times the resources in outer space than

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.690 
times the resources in outer space than
there<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.209> earth<00:02:15.769> what<00:02:16.769> NASA<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.220> doing<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
there on earth what NASA is doing is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.600 
there on earth what NASA is doing is
we're<00:02:18.480> stretching<00:02:18.810> beyond<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.769> we're

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
we're stretching beyond that we're

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.360 
we're stretching beyond that we're
looking<00:02:20.879> at<00:02:21.000> large<00:02:21.299> structures<00:02:22.370> civil

applications so in in my world
3d<00:02:43.799> printing<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.310> already<00:02:44.700> old<00:02:45.409> but<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:47.010> next

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
3d printing is already old but the next

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.759 
3d printing is already old but the next
wave<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:49.609> digital<00:02:50.609> materials<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.769> digital

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
wave is digital materials and digital

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.729

find a way to robotically assemble these
voxels<00:03:11.760> into<00:03:12.269> an<00:03:12.870> object<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.650> 3d<00:03:14.159> object<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.849> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
voxels into an object a 3d object if you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940 
voxels into an object a 3d object if you
could<00:03:15.299> make<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.569> digital<00:03:15.989> material<00:03:16.769> with

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
could make a digital material with

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.490 
could make a digital material with
discrete<00:03:17.540> digital<00:03:18.540> elements<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.440> be

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
discrete digital elements that can be

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.550 
discrete digital elements that can be
oriented<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.489> bonded<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.660> any<00:03:21.870> way<00:03:22.500> you

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
oriented and bonded in in any way you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.619 
oriented and bonded in in any way you
want<00:03:22.919> then<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.299> ultimate

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
want then you have the ultimate

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.960 
want then you have the ultimate
manufacturing<00:03:25.620> technology<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
manufacturing technology so I think the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.229 
manufacturing technology so I think the
future<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.329> digital<00:03:27.930> materials<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.609> make

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
future is digital materials if you make

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.750 
future is digital materials if you make
things<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.750> space<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:32.160> things<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.549> make

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
things in space and the things you make

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.960 
things in space and the things you make
make<00:03:33.120> other<00:03:33.329> things<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.459> exponential

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
make other things you have exponential

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.390 
make other things you have exponential
growth<00:03:36.739> when<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:37.919> exponential<00:03:38.459> growth

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
growth when you have exponential growth

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.939 
growth when you have exponential growth
everything<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:42.139> becomes<00:03:43.139> unimaginably

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
everything just becomes unimaginably

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:48.129 
everything just becomes unimaginably
rich<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.239> takes<00:03:45.480> off<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:47.459> have

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
rich it just takes off and you have

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.900 
rich it just takes off and you have
nothing<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:49.169> can<00:03:49.440> stop<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.859> because<00:03:50.370> you

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
nothing that can stop you because you

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.300 
nothing that can stop you because you
have<00:03:51.060> free<00:03:51.359> energy<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.959> unlimited<00:03:52.410> resources

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
have free energy and unlimited resources

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.689 
have free energy and unlimited resources
in<00:03:53.519> space<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> at<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.049> point<00:03:55.169> in<00:03:55.560> time

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
in space so at that point in time

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.640 
in space so at that point in time
civilization<00:03:56.699> will<00:03:57.690> go<00:03:58.049> out<00:03:58.260> into<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
civilization will go out into the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.099 
civilization will go out into the
