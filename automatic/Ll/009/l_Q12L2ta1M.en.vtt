00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
if you don't like it you don't have to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
if you don't like it you don't have to
accept<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.700> always<00:01:23.880> come<00:01:24.270> back<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.469 
accept that you can always come back and
pick<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> different<00:01:26.310> prefix<00:01:26.850> so

pick it up what a different prefix so
the<00:01:27.900> reason<00:01:28.350> why<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> sniper<00:01:29.520> rifle

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the reason why I like this sniper rifle

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.899 
the reason why I like this sniper rifle
is<00:01:30.150> number<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.960> has<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.680> decent<00:01:32.009> range<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
is number one it has a decent range it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.289 
is number one it has a decent range it
has<00:01:33.570> huge<00:01:34.350> damage<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> fact<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.090> has

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
has huge damage but the fact that it has

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.499 
has huge damage but the fact that it has
no<00:01:36.570> scope<00:01:36.930> makes<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:39.090> viable

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
no scope makes it actually a very viable

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
no scope makes it actually a very viable
weapon<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.100> close<00:01:41.460> quarters<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
weapon to use in close quarters in this

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.080 
weapon to use in close quarters in this
game<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.250> close

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
game and a lot of this game is close

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
game and a lot of this game is close
quarters<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> also<00:01:46.560> inside<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
quarters and also inside so a lot of

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
quarters and also inside so a lot of
this<00:01:48.060> sniper<00:01:48.299> rifles<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this sniper rifles that do have the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
this sniper rifles that do have the
longer<00:01:49.860> zoom<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> fremitus<00:01:50.729> edge<00:01:51.090> are

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
longer zoom like the fremitus edge are

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.530 
longer zoom like the fremitus edge are
actually<00:01:52.140> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> useless<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.729> way<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.149> play

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
actually kind of useless the way I play

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually kind of useless the way I play
