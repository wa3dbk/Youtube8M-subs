five hours maximum now the second
version<00:02:37.709> actually<00:02:38.069> feels<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.880> lot<00:02:39.120> lighter

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
version actually feels a lot lighter

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.140 
version actually feels a lot lighter
than<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.110> previous<00:02:40.140> generation<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.550> that's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
than the previous generation so that's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.050 
than the previous generation so that's
pretty<00:02:42.510> good<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.959> feels<00:02:43.319> much<00:02:44.069> sturdier<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
pretty good it feels much sturdier and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.270 
pretty good it feels much sturdier and
lighter<00:02:45.450> than<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.989> previous<00:02:46.019> one<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.070> that's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
lighter than the previous one so that's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.449 
lighter than the previous one so that's
really<00:02:47.430> nice<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.820> see<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:49.739> has<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> really

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
really nice to see it has a really

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.090 
really nice to see it has a really
really<00:02:50.700> nice<00:02:50.970> rubberized<00:02:51.690> finish<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:53.070> it

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
really nice rubberized finish to it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.280 
really nice rubberized finish to it
which<00:02:53.760> looks<00:02:53.790> absolutely<00:02:54.330> stunning<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
which looks absolutely stunning in the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.530 
which looks absolutely stunning in the
color<00:02:55.500> black<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.519> rat<00:02:56.730> didn't<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.330> look

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
color black the rat didn't really look

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.170 
color black the rat didn't really look
as<00:02:57.780> good<00:02:57.959> as<00:02:58.019> black<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:59.100> does<00:02:59.730> also<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
as good as black but it does also have a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.750 
as good as black but it does also have a
metal<00:03:03.180> grill<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:05.010> will<00:03:05.190> make<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.519> pretty

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
metal grill so that will make it pretty

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.610 
metal grill so that will make it pretty
sturdy<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.690> won't<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.019> break<00:03:07.380> that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
sturdy and it won't really break that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.040 
sturdy and it won't really break that
easily<00:03:07.860> at<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.030> bottom<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:09.660> pretty<00:03:09.959> much

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
easily at the bottom it's pretty much

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.680 
easily at the bottom it's pretty much
the<00:03:10.110> same<00:03:10.410> thing<00:03:10.769> as<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.550> last<00:03:12.090> version<00:03:12.390> as

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the same thing as the last version as

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.770 
the same thing as the last version as
well<00:03:13.580> they<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:14.610> went<00:03:15.090> with<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.269> rubberized

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
well they just went with a rubberized

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.900 
well they just went with a rubberized
material<00:03:15.959> for<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> whole<00:03:17.010> bottom<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.880> it

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
material for the whole bottom so it

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.610 
material for the whole bottom so it
doesn't<00:03:18.329> really<00:03:18.390> move<00:03:18.690> when<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.049> put<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.470> on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
doesn't really move when you put it on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.300 
doesn't really move when you put it on
one<00:03:20.280> place<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:21.000> ain't<00:03:21.329> going<00:03:21.570> nowhere<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:23.190> be

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
one place it ain't going nowhere to be

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.250 
one place it ain't going nowhere to be
quite<00:03:23.579> honest<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.390> there's<00:03:24.810> nothing

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
quite honest with you there's nothing

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.650 
quite honest with you there's nothing
much<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> say<00:03:25.860> about<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.340> speaker<00:03:26.850> as<00:03:27.060> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
much to say about this speaker as it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.569 
much to say about this speaker as it
does<00:03:27.840> actually<00:03:28.049> look<00:03:28.320> quite<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.769> lot<00:03:29.100> like<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
does actually look quite a lot like the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.660 
does actually look quite a lot like the
previous<00:03:29.850> one<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.540> has<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.260> same<00:03:31.470> design<00:03:31.920> some

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
previous one it has the same design some

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.819 
previous one it has the same design some
of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.850> features<00:03:33.030> are<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.450> same<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.410> is

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
of the features are the same but it is

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
of the features are the same but it is
definitely<00:03:35.070> much<00:03:35.610> upgraded<00:03:36.329> from<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> last

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
definitely much upgraded from the last

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.440 
definitely much upgraded from the last
version<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.769> that's<00:03:37.980> pretty<00:03:38.190> good<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.579> see<00:03:38.760> for

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
version so that's pretty good to see for

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.449 
version so that's pretty good to see for
example<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:40.019> lightweight<00:03:40.320> it's<00:03:41.220> much

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
example it's lightweight it's much

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.120 
example it's lightweight it's much
lighter<00:03:41.760> than<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.180> previous<00:03:42.209> generation

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
lighter than the previous generation

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.150 
lighter than the previous generation
it's<00:03:44.130> much<00:03:44.400> better<00:03:44.670> sounds<00:03:45.359> louder<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.350> it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
it's much better sounds louder and it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's much better sounds louder and it
looks<00:03:47.340> nicer<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.720> now<00:03:48.840> let's<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.380> jump<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.769> to

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
looks nicer so now let's just jump on to

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.400 
looks nicer so now let's just jump on to
the<00:03:50.130> sound<00:03:50.430> test<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:51.120> course<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.019> sentient

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the sound test of course the sentient

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.800 
the sound test of course the sentient
person<00:03:52.890> would<00:03:53.280> be<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.640> best<00:03:53.880> idea<00:03:54.090> but

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
person would be the best idea but

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.150 
person would be the best idea but
unfortunately<00:03:55.470> can't<00:03:56.280> come<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.170> guys<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
unfortunately can't come to you guys to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160 
unfortunately can't come to you guys to
give<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> sound<00:03:59.790> test<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.450> I'm<00:04:00.870> gonna<00:04:00.989> just

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
give you a sound test so I'm gonna just

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.800 
give you a sound test so I'm gonna just
give<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.590> little<00:04:01.620> idea<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.670> how<00:04:02.850> loud<00:04:03.570> this

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
give you a little idea of how loud this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.099 
give you a little idea of how loud this
is<00:04:04.019> just<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.829> give<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.400> idea<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.600> it's

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
is just to give you a idea that it's

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.229 
is just to give you a idea that it's
pretty<00:04:07.410> loud<00:04:07.680> with<00:04:08.070> bluetooth<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.090> you

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
pretty loud with bluetooth but if you

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.590 
pretty loud with bluetooth but if you
use<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.170> wire<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.829> not<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.519> loud<00:04:11.850> so

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
use it with a wire is not that loud so

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.520 
use it with a wire is not that loud so
Bluetooth<00:04:13.290> would<00:04:13.560> be<00:04:13.739> much<00:04:13.920> louder<00:04:14.160> then<00:04:14.910> a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
Bluetooth would be much louder then a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.949 
Bluetooth would be much louder then a
wire<00:04:16.530> would<00:04:16.919> be<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.269> definitely<00:04:18.630> recommend

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
wire would be so I definitely recommend

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.589 
wire would be so I definitely recommend
using<00:04:19.530> bluetooth<00:04:20.039> but<00:04:20.700> for<00:04:20.940> right<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.120> it's

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
using bluetooth but for right now it's

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.719 
using bluetooth but for right now it's
not<00:04:21.780> really<00:04:22.169> pairing<00:04:22.530> up<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:22.770> my<00:04:23.130> device<00:04:23.460> so

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
not really pairing up with my device so

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.290 
not really pairing up with my device so
I'm<00:04:23.880> just<00:04:24.090> gonna<00:04:24.240> go<00:04:24.330> ahead<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.810> you
