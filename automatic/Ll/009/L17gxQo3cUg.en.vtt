went<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.100> secure<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> 3-1<00:00:48.539> lead<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.870> he

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
went on to secure a 3-1 lead and he

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.240 
went on to secure a 3-1 lead and he
could<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.410> been<00:00:49.500> forgiven<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.129> thinking
