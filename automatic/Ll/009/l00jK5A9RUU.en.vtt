creative<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.589> guess<00:00:50.649> you<00:00:50.949> could<00:00:51.100> say<00:00:51.129> well<00:00:51.519> it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
creative I guess you could say well it

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.279 
creative I guess you could say well it
was<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.820> camera<00:00:52.059> but<00:00:52.359> it<00:00:52.510> sounded<00:00:52.899> like<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.170> had

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
was a camera but it sounded like you had

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.110 
was a camera but it sounded like you had
inside<00:00:54.010> information<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.640> was<00:00:54.699> really<00:00:54.910> good

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
inside information it was really good

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.880 
inside information it was really good
you<00:00:55.390> hear<00:00:55.629> like<00:00:55.809> it's<00:00:56.289> chirping<00:00:56.739> in<00:00:56.859> the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
you hear like it's chirping in the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.279 
you hear like it's chirping in the
background<00:00:56.980> right<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.269> actually<00:00:58.629> love<00:00:59.109> that

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
background right so I actually love that

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.720 
background right so I actually love that
question<00:00:59.499> I<00:00:59.800> think<00:00:59.859> it's<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.129> good<00:01:00.280> question

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
question I think it's a good question

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.979 
question I think it's a good question
and<00:01:00.879> it's<00:01:00.999> something<00:01:01.089> that<00:01:01.510> I<00:01:01.690> personally

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
and it's something that I personally

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.689 
and it's something that I personally
struggled<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.129> my<00:01:03.249> first<00:01:03.280> year<00:01:03.670> of

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
struggled with in my first year of

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.970 
struggled with in my first year of
college<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:04.330> didn't<00:01:04.900> do<00:01:05.050> as<00:01:05.320> well<00:01:05.350> as<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.800> thought

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
college I didn't do as well as I thought

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.130 
college I didn't do as well as I thought
I<00:01:06.040> would<00:01:06.280> do<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:06.610> college<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.240> my<00:01:07.420> first<00:01:07.750> year

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
I would do in college in my first year

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.620 
I would do in college in my first year
and<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.650> was<00:01:08.740> because<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:10.000> transition

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
and it was because you you transition

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.660 
and it was because you you transition
from<00:01:10.780> high<00:01:10.990> school<00:01:11.020> which<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.770> my<00:01:11.980> opinion<00:01:12.130> was

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
from high school which in my opinion was

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.030 
from high school which in my opinion was
too<00:01:12.910> easy<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.930> college<00:01:14.500> where<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.770> actually

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
too easy to college where you actually

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.770 
too easy to college where you actually
have<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.610> do<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.790> significant<00:01:16.510> amount<00:01:16.720> of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
have to do a significant amount of

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.350 
have to do a significant amount of
reading<00:01:17.020> okay<00:01:17.290> well<00:01:17.440> can<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.650> just<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:18.160> guess<00:01:18.850> I'm

reading okay well can I just I guess I'm

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.150

oh my god
no<00:01:30.550> I<00:01:30.850> think<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.870> I'm<00:01:31.990> guessing<00:01:32.530> here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
no I think that and I'm guessing here

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.560 
no I think that and I'm guessing here
I'm<00:01:32.980> and<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.760> think<00:01:33.970> I'm<00:01:34.090> being<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.360> little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
I'm and I think I'm being a little

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.760 
I'm and I think I'm being a little
unfair<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.960> myself<00:01:35.140> because<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.500> think<00:01:35.560> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
unfair to myself because I think it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.870 
unfair to myself because I think it
might<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.070> been<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.220> little<00:01:36.370> higher<00:01:36.610> than

you have to figure that part out and

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.069 
you have to figure that part out and
that's<00:02:52.909> what<00:02:53.180> actually<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.599> high<00:02:53.720> school<00:02:53.989> is

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079

that's what actually what high school is
for<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.290> think<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.889> don't<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:55.639> don't<00:02:56.180> even

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
for I think I don't know I don't even

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.670 
for I think I don't know I don't even
really<00:02:56.389> remember<00:02:56.720> setting<00:02:57.139> in<00:02:57.349> high<00:02:57.439> school

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
really remember setting in high school

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.740 
really remember setting in high school
but<00:02:57.829> with<00:02:57.919> college<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.639> it's<00:02:59.450> different

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
but with college like it's different

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.140 
but with college like it's different
because<00:03:00.109> you<00:03:00.739> need<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.189> take<00:03:01.400> notes<00:03:01.879> during

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
because you need to take notes during

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.729 
because you need to take notes during
your<00:03:02.389> lecture<00:03:02.540> classes<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.200> think<00:03:03.230> taking

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
your lecture classes I think taking

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.679 
your lecture classes I think taking
notes<00:03:03.919> during<00:03:04.189> lecture<00:03:04.669> is<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:04.909> million<00:03:05.419> times

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
notes during lecture is a million times

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.780 
notes during lecture is a million times
more<00:03:06.019> important<00:03:06.530> than<00:03:06.889> actually<00:03:07.099> reading<00:03:07.519> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
more important than actually reading the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.659 
more important than actually reading the
textbook<00:03:08.389> because<00:03:09.230> during<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.069> lecture<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
textbook because during the lecture the

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.640 
textbook because during the lecture the
professor<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.180> basically<00:03:11.569> telling<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.139> this

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
professor is basically telling you this

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.569 
professor is basically telling you this
is<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.189> will<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.579> on<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.000> test<00:03:15.189> answer<00:03:16.189> to

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
is what will be on the test answer to

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.180 
is what will be on the test answer to
question<00:03:17.269> number<00:03:17.299> one<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:18.049> be<00:03:18.470> it's<00:03:18.829> almost

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
question number one is be it's almost

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.159 
question number one is be it's almost
that<00:03:19.489> easy<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.239> pay<00:03:20.419> attention<00:03:20.449> to<00:03:20.870> lecture

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
that easy just pay attention to lecture

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.080 
that easy just pay attention to lecture

that's it yeah you'll find you'll find
professors<00:03:30.229> that<00:03:30.409> all<00:03:30.680> Beca<00:03:31.129> said<00:03:31.430> it's

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
professors that all Beca said it's

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.619 
professors that all Beca said it's
different<00:03:31.729> time<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.180> you're<00:03:32.299> gonna<00:03:32.389> find

professors<00:03:33.139> that<00:03:33.319> what<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:34.280> seems<00:03:34.909> like<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.690> is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
professors that what it seems like it is

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
yeah those professors are doing it so

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.770 
yeah those professors are doing it so
they'll<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.579> cryptic<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.120> things<00:03:41.359> they<00:03:41.510> say

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
they'll be cryptic and things they say

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.240 
they'll be cryptic and things they say
or<00:03:42.079> then<00:03:42.290> they'll<00:03:42.470> make<00:03:42.620> things<00:03:42.859> harder<00:03:43.220> on

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
or then they'll make things harder on

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.789 
or then they'll make things harder on
you<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.579> first<00:03:43.790> place<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.440> maybe

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
you in the first place just so you maybe

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.199 
you in the first place just so you maybe
have<00:03:45.979> to<00:03:46.069> figure<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.370> out<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:46.609> want<00:03:47.090> this

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
have to figure it out they want this

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.819 
have to figure it out they want this
seems<00:03:47.449> like<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.720> try<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> teach<00:03:48.139> you<00:03:48.169> how<00:03:48.799> to

up<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:03.019> classes<00:04:03.139> I<00:04:03.560> did<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:03.949> it<00:04:04.189> was<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
up for classes I did that it was a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.949 
up for classes I did that it was a
really<00:04:04.790> helpful<00:04:04.970> tool<00:04:05.389> there<00:04:05.689> were<00:04:05.750> classes

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
really helpful tool there were classes

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.780 
really helpful tool there were classes
that<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.319> avoided<00:04:06.620> because<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:07.250> there<00:04:07.609> are

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
that I avoided because there there are

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.879 
that I avoided because there there are
professors<00:04:08.209> like<00:04:08.569> that<00:04:08.780> like<00:04:09.229> they<00:04:09.379> get<00:04:09.560> some

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
professors like that like they get some

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
sort of thrill out of making their class

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.719 
sort of thrill out of making their class
like<00:04:12.139> this<00:04:12.290> huge<00:04:12.560> obstacle<00:04:13.189> course<00:04:13.430> that's

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
like this huge obstacle course that's

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.089 
like this huge obstacle course that's
impossible<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.509> pass<00:04:14.659> so<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.799> do<00:04:16.039> your

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
impossible to pass so just do your

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.649 
impossible to pass so just do your
research<00:04:16.280> on<00:04:16.579> your<00:04:16.729> professors<00:04:17.180> -<00:04:17.389> right

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
research on your professors - right

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.060

before you actually enroll for their
classes<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.699> then<00:04:19.940> because<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.509> think

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
classes and then because that I think

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.110 
classes and then because that I think
partially<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.529> ones<00:04:21.739> who<00:04:21.919> still<00:04:22.849> act<00:04:23.029> like

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
partially the ones who still act like

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.399 
partially the ones who still act like
high<00:04:23.360> school<00:04:23.599> teachers<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.200> breeze

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
high school teachers that you breeze

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.690 
high school teachers that you breeze
through<00:04:24.440> their<00:04:25.340> class

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
through their class

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.120 
through their class
from<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.630> know<00:04:26.780> they<00:04:27.020> probably<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:28.010> know

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
from you know they probably you know

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.980 
from you know they probably you know
students<00:04:28.940> eventually<00:04:29.120> start<00:04:29.510> saying<00:04:29.690> oh<00:04:29.780> yeah

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
students eventually start saying oh yeah

students eventually start saying oh yeah
he's<00:04:30.710> easy<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.220> then<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.210> their

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
he's easy and then you you know their

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.330 
he's easy and then you you know their
basic<00:04:32.810> considered<00:04:33.200> chumps<00:04:33.530> yeah<00:04:33.950> don't<00:04:34.250> take

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
basic considered chumps yeah don't take

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.220 
basic considered chumps yeah don't take
those<00:04:34.520> classes<00:04:34.880> it's<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.600> it's<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.050> happy
