00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.799
 Hello, our dear lovers 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.340
 violin in this video we will look at how 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 the right to play the violin so welcome 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.490
 like pizzicato 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 even the word itself is interesting so it sounds 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.660
 pizzicato are often used in 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 orchestral music in general 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.539
 ensemble arrangements 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.550
 that is, it is a very beautiful reception 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 violin feature i.e. violin 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.290
 can play long notes with a bag but 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 also like a guitar let's say 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.020
 almost constantly hail pizzicato 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 the violin can also lose with cyc 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.370
 here but we will look at how to do it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.710
 more correctly and professionally the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.469
 have this video be addressed to students 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.680
 music school beginner downloaded those 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.620
 who is interested in the script of their parents and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.039
 so how to play pizzicato right 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.970
 but first of all we will consider of course 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:15.450
 technical moments that is, we have screens 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 violin like us and let's say the following 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.470
 phrase we need to play pizzicato 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 notice the right hand that u 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.590
 us going with the right hand we need 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 right hand to do tweaking the strings we neither 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.869
 in no case do and just take and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 Immediately tweaked although sometimes this too 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.820
 practiced mostly masculine if 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.820
 need to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.530
 it is practiced of course 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.439
 way you can and drink canton more often 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.659
 just more rational and correct 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.659
 notice the right hand 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:03.160
 that is, we do this reception we played 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.840
 the arch is boring bow and then we 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.830
 look how we do we take and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.429
 bow 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.140
 release the first thumb the thumb and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.690
 bow 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.260
 heals we clamp as if we clamp in 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:25.970
 fist cam squeezed we were freed 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.050
 two fingers we put big finger 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.020
 pay attention to the ledge 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 corner such a hand 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.070
 steadily stood on the violin here and further 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:53.620
 we are already convenient for us to make pizzicato 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:57.459
 pay attention here this pizza cat 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.370
 what else is worth considering 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.580
 by no means that is preferably not 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.530
 do virtually no 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.769
 professional music simplified 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.200
 musicians such sand the stake light 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.630
 when we barely catch strings 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.130
 can be used somewhere but 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.049
 in principle most often we must 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.000
 properly put your finger on the string and 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.959
 pull the country and explain sharply then 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.480
 it turns out quality sound 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.090
 we have to put vision on the table 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.310
 but at the same time if we already played 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.470
 notice how to do wrong 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.489
 we played once set 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:45.530
 Ushguli was unpleasant when 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:49.010
 we put a finger here drowned out 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.170
 string such a rattling sound 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.170
 it turns out so we need lightning speed 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.400
 we definitely need to put a finger on 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.439
 string and pinch 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.470
 but it needs to be done if we are with us 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.329
 the string already sounds it oscillates to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.810
 there was no such 3 lying silence 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:13.480
 strings 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:16.759
 we just need to quickly do 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 quickly put uriyu not at the last 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:29.240
 moment before we pinch us 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:33.530
 need to put a finger gang of 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:40.130
 the sequence left 0 in no way 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:46.010
 If not, then it turns out to be superfluous 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.380
 such a sound is unpleasant and so we 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:58.070
 consider how this can be done 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:05:02.320
 Now technically this is my bow, so I 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.320
 now made pizzicato accord cl 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.139
 note that of course I already 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.630
 the bow was in our hand in this case 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.560
 no need we play all the strings in 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.930
 then a chord pizzicato is played 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.289
 notice my may play we 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.900
 do not play here in this position along 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.260
 fingerboard and stand money game we play 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.930
 as if 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.930
 may skazt like a harp I am like a harp 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:42.330
 This is also an option pizzicato but 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:45.960
 I will show you again how you can 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:06:21.300
 Bow quickly take in the comfortable position 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:06:24.210
 for the pizza game of the year here I am fast bow 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.520
 beluga with such a position in such it 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.150
 once again I will show that here I am 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.250
 hold my bow I wrap my fingers in this 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.080
 and the place did not same site two 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.110
 finger is released and 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.830
 you need to quickly put this one 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.200
 the ledge and that is the violin is enough 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.310
 such a professional tool is 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.330
 hard to put and still I tweak 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.820
 as I explained already this way 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.970
 Of course there may be other options. 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.280
 pizzicato in this video we covered 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.950
 key features like professional 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.870
