behringer x32 one major difference
between<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.070> iPhone<00:00:11.460> app<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.969> Android<00:00:12.480> app

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
between the iPhone app and Android app

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.690 
between the iPhone app and Android app
is<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> iPhone<00:00:14.009> app<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.490> only

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
is that with the iPhone app you can only

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.760 
is that with the iPhone app you can only
control<00:00:15.120> an<00:00:15.360> individual<00:00:15.960> monitor<00:00:16.500> mix

could<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.379> bad<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> start

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
could be be bad so we're going to start

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
could be be bad so we're going to start
by<00:00:46.950> connecting<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> board<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.270> I'll<00:00:49.079> start

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
