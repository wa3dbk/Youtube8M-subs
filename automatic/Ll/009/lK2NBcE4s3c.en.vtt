 instant riding one of the universities 7 but 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.510
 more on that later in our other videos 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.820
 schools today sightseeing tours of 3 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.420
 parts of the exam als namely all 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420
 frightened 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 I remind you that part of the lighting surrenders 3 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.710
 blocks bald revealed find that is how we 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.289
 moment you may already be a little tired 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 because it's the third hour 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.789
 examination situation is important to know 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 this is important to consider when preparing something 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 there is getting ready to find out but very important 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.710
 and useful under stress conditions 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.420
 when you are tired precisely because such 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.979
 conditions will be during the exam 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.950
 so what is the part of a site? 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 Eugenol benefits to the part you will have 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 two assignments and a total of 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.369
 sixty minutes to do 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 You'll start both of these tasks with the second. 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 parts 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 namely with because firstly she 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.259
 very similar 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.450
 in academic and scientist ios and secondly 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.090
 because it is significant for him 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.310
 more more points let's see 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 for example let's start the initial 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.680
 as you can see it from and asks to discuss the topic 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.170
 the one who should pay for the house 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 elderly state or family 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 elderly person that is discuss 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 social question choice such topic is not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.280
 accidentally jen wiles designed for wide 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.040
 a circle of people and therefore suggests themes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.079
 which must be understood by all important 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.509
 the iso component is the arguments and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.130
 see examples see how task 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.950
 emphasizes that the essay should 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.670
 keep risen your one so well and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 examples 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 move on to when someone in this part 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.600
 we are invited to discuss the pros and cons 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.640
 study and work abroad also as 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.640
 participation jamila task emphasizes 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.520
 the importance of arguments and examples as well as 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 and learning you need to write 250 words and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.170
 spend no more than 40 minutes i.e. 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.820
 to a large extent if we compare two 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.370
 tasks and ranks and 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.360
 over the years care of the second part 1 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.570
 quite similar 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.480
 much in common what is different then a 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.060
 for years shouting at the wiles part 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.209
 the biggest difference is the task 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.400
 number one and when it's beautiful i need 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.230
 will describe a graph or table 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.470
 then make the so -called this such 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.920
 enjoy why we will write a letter 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.170
 we will sort for example we will begin with years clarus 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.200
 we have a typical part assignment 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.540
 Academician Ryan presents income graph 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.000
 3 blonde bakeries not for a few 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.350
 years our task is to describe the main 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.350
 trends and make a comparison 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.440
 when I myself was preparing for l and when I 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.900
 meiko 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.420
 for studying in england me this is the first part 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.700
 1 description of the chart or table scarecrow 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.250
 most of all but as it turned out she 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.870
 fairly predictable and if not given 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 arm properly prepare for it 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.790
 prepare not quite so difficult 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.860
 do not be alarmed you will succeed 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.710
 let's see what he writes in the first part 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.820
 gets in ls let me remind you that this letter 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.980
 we have an example of a very, very typical 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.320
 you live in a dorm faced with 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.180
 numerous problems your task 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.340
 write a convincing letter to someone

 manages the distribution of housing and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.360
 ask for a replacement 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.910
 you should describe the situation explained in 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.840
 what is the problem and suggest 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.150
 alternative 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.230
 all this needs to spend no more than 20 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.940
 minutes and write a 150 word again 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.160
 if positive not to think about what 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.290
 letters this is a very useful assignment 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.380
 in fact in real life we ​​write 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.390
 letters are constantly their shadows it is useful 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.390
