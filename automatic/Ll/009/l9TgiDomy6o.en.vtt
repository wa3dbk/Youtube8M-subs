I'm not gonna lie it's not like you can

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
I'm not gonna lie it's not like you can
just<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.329> thing<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.290> sleep<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
just put this thing on in your sleep it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.649 
just put this thing on in your sleep it
takes<00:01:41.520> me<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:41.970> time<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> put<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.509> things

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
takes me some time to put these things

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.910 
takes me some time to put these things
on<00:01:42.840> sometimes<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.590> gets<00:01:43.680> quite

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
on sometimes and it gets quite

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
on sometimes and it gets quite
frustrating<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:45.869> what

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
frustrating so if you don't know what

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
frustrating so if you don't know what
you're<00:01:46.049> doing<00:01:46.259> highly<00:01:46.890> recommend<00:01:47.490> reading

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you're doing highly recommend reading

you're doing highly recommend reading
the<00:01:47.850> instructions<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:49.619> take<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> cheap

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the instructions and don't take a cheap

the instructions and don't take a cheap
way<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.880> CPU<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.540> come

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
way out because your CPU could come

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
way out because your CPU could come
unseated<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:53.149> wouldn't<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.210> good<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
see come to little it came a little

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.770 
see come to little it came a little
damage<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.180> worried<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
damage I'm not really worried about that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.810 
damage I'm not really worried about that
that<00:01:58.170> thing<00:01:58.380> could<00:01:58.469> probably<00:01:58.680> come<00:01:58.890> off<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that thing could probably come off but I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.789 
that thing could probably come off but I
don't<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.140> I'm

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
don't know it's just kind of there I'm

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.899 
don't know it's just kind of there I'm
not<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.040> worried<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:02.340> though<00:02:02.670> because

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
not really worried about though because

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.980 
not really worried about though because
that's<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> probably<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.689> against<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that's going to probably go against the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
that's going to probably go against the
cooler<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> front

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
cooler and this will be on the front

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.999 
cooler and this will be on the front
it's<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> nice<00:02:06.540> fan<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.290> completely<00:02:07.680> black

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
it's a nice fan it's completely black

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's a nice fan it's completely black
and<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.729> see-through<00:02:08.940> looks<00:02:09.869> real

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and it's kind of see-through looks real

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
and it's kind of see-through looks real
nice<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.800> real<00:02:11.039> smooth

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
nice so it's real smooth

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
nice so it's real smooth

because<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.160> pretty<00:02:38.459> big<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.060> see

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
because it is pretty big as you can see

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
got the head direct heat pipe touch as I

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.990 
got the head direct heat pipe touch as I
said<00:02:51.569> it's<00:02:52.019> very<00:02:52.620> nice<00:02:52.830> looking<00:02:53.100> I'm<00:02:53.819> going<00:02:53.940> to
