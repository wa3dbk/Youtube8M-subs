00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.719
 well now we move on to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.920
 this other two-year period of revolt 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 in europe we start seeing how it was 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 ended the independence war for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 Greece is that war that was 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 burst in 21 ends in 29 with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 full independence in the nation that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 is recognized by the main ones 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 European powers as independent 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 but the real protagonist of 1830 is the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 france we had seen it was 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.670
 distinguished particularly in the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.670
 repression of the motions of 20 21 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 although it was not touched then it was 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.840
 re now there is a revolution 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.449
 then it was the king carlo tenth we see it 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.420
 in the guise of a truly sovereign 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.760
 of the ancient regime was particularly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.059
 backward had imposed a very painful 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.640
 censorship had restored certain beliefs 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.090
 of medieval origin for example the idea 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 that the king may be such by divine will 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 that he was able to cure diseases 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 in other words, with the touch of your hands 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 set of beliefs that they no longer had 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 nothing to do with the modern state 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.680
 with France in particular that was 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.740
 was the home of the revolution a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.500
 paris bursts from 27 to 29 July 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.640
 armed insurrection with lots of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.770
 barricades along the roads immortalized in 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.070
 numerous paintings and is a real one 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.759
 popular uprising is seen as possible 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.940
 note here in the bourgeois picture together with 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.180
 common artisans that really 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 they arm themselves and face the king's army 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.170
 the king flees and in his place comes 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.630
 named king ligi filippo luigi filippo 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.600
 d'or the anchors of more liberal tendencies 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.130
 that as we see in this picture yes 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 care to sign a constitution 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.340
 then we pass by a king equipped with 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.800
 scepter and golden crown that is made 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.820
 to portray with the hand on the constitution 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is the July revolution in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.420
 france marks a turning point in history 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 europe 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.830
 this happened precisely at the end of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.080
 July to August in the low countries 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.720
 a revolt breaks out asking 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.820
 Belgium's independence is not one 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.230
 bloody revolt is obtained 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.950
 quite easily even for 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.560
 England's support in November 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.870
 in the same year there are many 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.090
 insurrections in poland 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.220
 poland is a state that more than 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.180
 any other perhaps in Europe you hear 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.880
 a nation and is continually disputed 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.470
 from the people between Germany and Russia 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.680
 these solutions have no 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.920
 success are suffocated in the blood 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.040
 a few months after February 1831 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.350
 here a modena breaks out 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.390
 Modena insurrection we recall was 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.300
 ruled by a Duke of Hapsburg blood 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.660
 and therefore the patriots in particular ciro 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.610
 menotti perhaps counting on the support of 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.040
 luigi filippo then of the new real 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.380
 French liberal organize this 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.690
 revolt, however, that ends absolutely 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.530
 tragically, little men come 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.020
 hanged and all organizations 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.860
 Liberals suffer one 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.860
 setback
