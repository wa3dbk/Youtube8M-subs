especially<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:33.570> were<00:01:33.689> negative<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
especially there they were negative they

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289 
especially there they were negative they
didn't<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.490> defended<00:01:36.000> maybe

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
didn't if you know they defended maybe

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
didn't if you know they defended maybe
more<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.570> than<00:01:36.990> Barcelona<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> normal

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
more than than Barcelona which is normal

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
more than than Barcelona which is normal
but<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> every<00:01:39.390> chance<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.840> got<00:01:40.049> they

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
but if it every chance they got they

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
but if it every chance they got they
tried<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.560> attack<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> score<00:01:41.640> goals<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> at

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
tried to attack the score goals and at

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
tried to attack the score goals and at
the<00:01:42.360> end<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.840> proved<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> decisive

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the end that proved to be a decisive

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.010 
the end that proved to be a decisive
thing<00:01:44.579> given<00:01:44.939> although<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:45.869> they've

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
thing given although I feel they've

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
thing given although I feel they've
created<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.590> many<00:01:46.710> chances<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.310> were<00:01:47.430> really

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
created so many chances they were really

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.510 
created so many chances they were really
unlucky<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.770> played<00:01:50.070> really

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
unlucky but they they played really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429
