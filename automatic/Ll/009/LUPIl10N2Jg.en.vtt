00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 well this time I have except for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 few news that I'm starting now 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 informally and well then today they 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 I bring the new news that has been 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.770
 made known to the world and then they 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.560
 I bring the 3 new legendary pokémon 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.650
 of x 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.660
 and then they have hacked the pokémon game 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.780
 demands that you can already do that out there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.910
 I have seen it and they have taken out these is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 because I've never told you that your 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.000
 names are volcanoes by name 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.460
 obviously it must be the fire type or 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.340
 your body as it should be and do the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 type 0 the fire do or something like that good 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.030
 total good we went with the next one is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 a man is jansen this pokemon seems 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.690
 as a good psychic type I can 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 say nothing I can not assure you anything 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 for now because there is no information 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.720
 about them still because they have 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 been brought to light then it would come 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.200
 cup that this is this if it has rubbed me 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.200
 so much that he is very handsome and small 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.509
 and so 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.490
 this is seen as also cycle type 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.259
 but well , I told you at the expo 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.270
 secure anything because they have been taken out 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.000
 right now you do not have a time that you have 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.120
 taken out and then 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.890
 and out there I 've also heard that this 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.720
 will lose a little bit because one that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.690
 continue to lose a little bit of 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.820
 of toad if they go something like that since you will not have 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.870
 the same thing the event since it has not been 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.700
 formally so well 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.890
 at this time or lose many things but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.020
 well everyone this and we 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.330
 least I wanted to know that any 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.780
 hopes three little mont and well here 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.920
 you can see that I do not know who is traveling 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.980
 to his game I do not know what he was thinking 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.130
 that kind but good 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.900
 and then we have to tell you that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.820
 because he already deflated he does not have a 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.500
 information about them still soon 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.630
 we will see it when they take the event or if 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.750
 is that someone does not have unless 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.220
 take information out there but good 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.170
