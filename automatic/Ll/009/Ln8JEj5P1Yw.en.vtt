00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
king from The Lion King we've got a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.850 
king from The Lion King we've got a
melody<00:00:31.189> as<00:00:31.310> familiar<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.820> students<00:00:35.710> but<00:00:36.710> that

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
melody as familiar to students but that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.930 
melody as familiar to students but that
doesn't<00:00:37.100> mean<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:37.340> going<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.550> be<00:00:37.610> easy<00:00:37.820> for

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
doesn't mean it's going to be easy for

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.850 
doesn't mean it's going to be easy for
them<00:00:38.240> to<00:00:38.420> play<00:00:38.690> because<00:00:39.140> if<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.380> scan<00:00:39.650> that

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
them to play because if we scan that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.920 
them to play because if we scan that
music<00:00:40.310> we<00:00:40.490> notice<00:00:40.790> even<00:00:41.360> though<00:00:41.630> we<00:00:41.780> have<00:00:41.900> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
music we notice even though we have a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.290 
music we notice even though we have a
repetition<00:00:42.650> in<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.800> second<00:00:43.250> line<00:00:43.400> there's<00:00:44.180> a

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
repetition in the second line there's a

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.380 
repetition in the second line there's a
change<00:00:44.810> that's<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:45.530> inviting<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.280> stumble<00:00:46.880> so

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
change that's just inviting a stumble so

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.270 
change that's just inviting a stumble so
I<00:00:47.450> recommend<00:00:47.810> helping<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.530> student<00:00:48.950> find

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
I recommend helping the student find

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.280 
I recommend helping the student find
where<00:00:49.790> exactly<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.510> their<00:00:50.630> second<00:00:51.020> live<00:00:51.140> in

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
where exactly and their second live in

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.530 
where exactly and their second live in
music<00:00:51.620> does<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.860> change<00:00:52.160> take<00:00:52.490> place<00:00:52.820> and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
music does the change take place and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.720 
music does the change take place and
when<00:00:53.840> we<00:00:53.960> look<00:00:54.110> at<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:54.410> we<00:00:54.560> see<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.040> its<00:00:55.580> a

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
when we look at this we see that I its a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.710 
when we look at this we see that I its a
GE<00:00:56.150> here<00:00:57.310> and<00:00:58.310> the<00:00:58.490> first<00:00:58.760> line<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.630> the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
GE here and the first line but in the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.390 
GE here and the first line but in the
second<00:01:00.140> line<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:00.500> an<00:01:00.620> A<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:00.890> C<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:04.040> have<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
second line it's an A to C so have the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.520 
second line it's an A to C so have the
students<00:01:04.820> circle<00:01:05.179> the<00:01:05.299> first<00:01:05.630> note<00:01:06.109> that's

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
students circle the first note that's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.889 
students circle the first note that's
different<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:07.850> not<00:01:08.060> just<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:08.479> first<00:01:08.630> note

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
different but not just that first note

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.990 
different but not just that first note
circle<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.859> the<00:01:10.130> next<00:01:10.310> one<00:01:10.609> over<00:01:10.789> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
circle that and the next one over the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.919 
circle that and the next one over the
bar<00:01:11.240> line<00:01:11.539> so<00:01:11.899> that<00:01:12.109> J<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.780> then<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
bar line so that J to the a and then the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.109 
bar line so that J to the a and then the
next<00:01:15.229> line<00:01:15.409> is<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:16.039> AC<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:19.369> some<00:01:19.670> ways<00:01:19.850> this

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
next line is the AC in some ways this

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.690 
next line is the AC in some ways this
looks<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.749> student<00:01:21.200> like<00:01:22.009> these<00:01:22.249> are<00:01:22.460> big

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
looks to the student like these are big

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.330 
looks to the student like these are big
distances<00:01:23.299> one's<00:01:23.539> a<00:01:23.689> step<00:01:23.929> one's<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.380> skip<00:01:24.710> but

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
distances one's a step one's a skip but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.099 
distances one's a step one's a skip but
here's<00:01:25.549> what<00:01:25.759> we<00:01:25.909> can<00:01:26.030> do<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.479> help<00:01:26.630> make<00:01:26.899> this

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
here's what we can do to help make this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.590 
here's what we can do to help make this
easier<00:01:27.649> our<00:01:28.219> entire<00:01:28.609> set<00:01:28.999> of<00:01:29.119> notes<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.539> I

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
easier our entire set of notes and I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.480 
easier our entire set of notes and I
just<00:01:29.810> can't<00:01:30.020> wait<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.350> be<00:01:30.469> king<00:01:30.499> are<00:01:31.219> only

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
just can't wait to be king are only

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.719 
just can't wait to be king are only
these<00:01:31.700> five<00:01:32.090> knows

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.640 

and<00:01:37.119> even<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.020> chorus

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.830 

so<00:01:43.250> we've<00:01:43.400> got<00:01:43.490> some<00:01:43.640> very<00:01:44.000> expressive<00:01:44.450> notes

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
so we've got some very expressive notes

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.690 
so we've got some very expressive notes
there<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.470> when<00:01:45.740> we<00:01:45.770> go<00:01:45.980> back<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.430> what<00:01:46.550> we're

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
there and when we go back to what we're

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.460 
there and when we go back to what we're
just<00:01:46.820> talking<00:01:47.240> about<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.660> stepwise<00:01:47.960> motion

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
just talking about the stepwise motion

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.690 
just talking about the stepwise motion
here<00:01:49.870> that's<00:01:50.870> part<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.410> our<00:01:51.530> scale<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.460> if<00:01:52.580> we

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
here that's part of our scale but if we

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.760 
here that's part of our scale but if we
go<00:01:52.880> from<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.540> this<00:01:53.780> C<00:01:54.080> in<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> second

go from this a to this C in the second

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.620 
go from this a to this C in the second
line<00:01:54.920> we<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.580> think<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.060> as<00:01:56.270> adjacent

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
line we can think of that as adjacent
