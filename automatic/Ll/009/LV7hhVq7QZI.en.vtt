00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
they were up to date anyway so this is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.039 
they were up to date anyway so this is
the<00:00:13.980> linked<00:00:14.250> version<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> paper<00:00:15.509> boy<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the linked version of the paper boy and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.700 
the linked version of the paper boy and
it's<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.340> right<00:00:18.020> I'd<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.410> say<00:00:19.590> it's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's it's all right I'd like to say it's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.610 
it's it's all right I'd like to say it's
amazing<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:20.910> alike

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.620 
amazing because I look alike

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.530 
amazing because I look alike
you<00:00:22.190> can<00:00:22.400> see<00:00:22.580> for<00:00:22.760> yourself<00:00:22.820> that<00:00:23.210> while

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
you can see for yourself that while

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.140 
you can see for yourself that while
graphically<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.410> pretty<00:00:24.740> polished<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:26.030> a

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
graphically it's pretty polished it's a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.900 
graphically it's pretty polished it's a
little<00:00:26.270> on<00:00:26.540> the<00:00:26.570> slow<00:00:26.870> side<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:28.610> have

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
little on the slow side so you have

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.019 
little on the slow side so you have
another<00:00:29.150> speech<00:00:29.570> that<00:00:30.290> you've<00:00:30.470> got<00:00:30.710> on<00:00:30.740> the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
another speech that you've got on the

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.920 
another speech that you've got on the
arcade<00:00:32.029> version<00:00:32.060> which<00:00:32.570> is<00:00:32.690> rather

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
arcade version which is rather

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.070 
arcade version which is rather
surprising<00:00:33.650> really<00:00:33.800> because<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:35.420> Atari<00:00:35.990> Lynx

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
surprising really because the Atari Lynx

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.990 
surprising really because the Atari Lynx
was<00:00:36.680> pretty<00:00:37.250> good<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.640> old<00:00:37.730> sound

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
was pretty good in the old sound

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.330 
was pretty good in the old sound
department<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.140> I'm<00:00:39.470> not<00:00:39.770> quite<00:00:39.980> sure<00:00:40.010> what

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
department so I'm not quite sure what

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.049 
department so I'm not quite sure what
it's<00:00:40.489> included<00:00:40.850> but<00:00:41.809> I'm<00:00:41.960> hey<00:00:42.140> hey<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:42.970> it's<00:00:43.970> a

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
it's included but I'm hey hey but it's a

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.450 
it's included but I'm hey hey but it's a
decent<00:00:44.420> enough<00:00:44.480> conversion<00:00:45.200> you've<00:00:46.160> got<00:00:46.370> the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
decent enough conversion you've got the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.549 
decent enough conversion you've got the
whole<00:00:46.640> oh<00:00:47.059> there's<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.870> pause<00:00:48.080> there<00:00:48.320> where<00:00:48.530> I

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
whole oh there's a pause there where I

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.860 
whole oh there's a pause there where I
am<00:00:48.800> someone<00:00:49.489> came<00:00:49.610> up<00:00:49.700> in<00:00:49.820> another<00:00:50.000> screen<00:00:50.330> but

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
am someone came up in another screen but

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.950 
am someone came up in another screen but
you've<00:00:50.989> got<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.910> pretty<00:00:53.210> artistic<00:00:53.629> alee

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
you've got it's pretty artistic alee

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.780 
you've got it's pretty artistic alee
very<00:00:54.199> similar<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.589> the<00:00:54.710> our<00:00:54.890> big<00:00:55.129> gain<00:00:55.519> in

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
very similar to the our big gain in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.900 
very similar to the our big gain in
terms<00:00:56.150> of<00:00:56.449> how<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.379> level<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.800> structured<00:00:58.400> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
terms of how the level is structured the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.500 
terms of how the level is structured the
things<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.390> appear<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.820> know<00:01:01.970> it's<00:01:02.300> just

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
things that appear so you know it's just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.530 
things that appear so you know it's just
a<00:01:02.660> crippling<00:01:03.170> slide

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
a crippling slide

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.230 
a crippling slide
major

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.539 

there's<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:07.990> no<00:01:08.110> no<00:01:08.619> excitement<00:01:08.920> like<00:01:09.369> that

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
there's just no no excitement like that

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.530 
there's just no no excitement like that
was<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.939> UM<00:01:10.030> original<00:01:10.570> arcade<00:01:10.840> game<00:01:12.540> but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
was in the UM original arcade game but

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.880 
was in the UM original arcade game but
it's<00:01:13.689> pretty<00:01:13.840> good<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.200> mean<00:01:14.439> it's<00:01:14.649> not<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
it's pretty good I mean it's not the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's pretty good I mean it's not the
poorest<00:01:15.280> conversion<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.909> faithfully<00:01:16.479> not<00:01:16.689> by

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
poorest conversion of faithfully not by

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.929 
poorest conversion of faithfully not by
a<00:01:16.869> longshot<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:18.070> when<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.340> consider<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
a longshot but when you consider the

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.899 
a longshot but when you consider the
high<00:01:19.090> standard<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:20.130> RK<00:01:21.130> conversions<00:01:21.670> on<00:01:21.789> the

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
high standard of RK conversions on the

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.200 
high standard of RK conversions on the
links<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:23.110> one's<00:01:23.409> like<00:01:23.950> average<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:24.850> opposed

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
links this one's like average as opposed

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.570 
links this one's like average as opposed
to<00:01:25.330> great<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.770> know<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:27.039> goes<00:01:27.250> against

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
to great and you know that goes against

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.380 
to great and you know that goes against
it<00:01:27.759> because<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.240> basically<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.979> many

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it because it's basically in so many

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.580 
it because it's basically in so many
there's<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:31.479> many<00:01:31.689> good<00:01:31.960> players<00:01:32.200> have<00:01:32.439> it's

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
there's so many good players have it's

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.999 
there's so many good players have it's
got<00:01:32.799> which<00:01:33.070> are<00:01:33.399> very<00:01:33.820> good<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.710> sadly<00:01:35.710> this

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
got which are very good and sadly this

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.720 
got which are very good and sadly this
isn't<00:01:36.220> one<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.490> them

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
isn't one of them

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.930 
isn't one of them
it's<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.660> quite<00:01:39.620> quite<00:01:40.010> pricey<00:01:40.310> game<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:40.790> well

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's a quite quite pricey game as well

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.350 
it's a quite quite pricey game as well
