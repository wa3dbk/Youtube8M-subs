00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.780
 hello everyone since 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.660
 videos about the flight program have become 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.049
 quite popular 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.299
 but I decided to remove the third issue now 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.469
 here is free time soon new year 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.159
 today before nato number by the way with 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.960
 coming 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.220
 and let's see what you are 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.939
 next programs which by the way is 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.960
 put on smartphones with 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.029
 operating system symbian 9 3 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 well, 9 4 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.210
 means a lot 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.210
 but he 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.260
 The first program that I did not say 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.920
 people that i really like this 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.450
 step back 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.809
 let's get a look 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690
 the principles of her work that the west is 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.790
 literate 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.420
 determining kokoity song song name 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630
 performer but i think 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.240
 many have seen mts montok phones sony 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.920
 ericsson 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.930
 but there are some which are like 3 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.260
 taiga books 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.630
 here and this attack is 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.270
 prince and a half cadier bote programs that there 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.840
 only this is for nokia for 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240
 ah background there 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.290
 in general, for such phones 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.780
 does that mean we need to find a song 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.870
 let's try the year 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.020
 Brazilian invisible aircraft 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.440
 let's see this here all the songs that 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.840
 I 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 I searched here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.690
 but which I tried 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.100
 it was a year 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.550
 in the role of mc there 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.690
 we will say so also them very 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.010
 initiative well so flip through here they are 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.100
 so interesting is not put 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.580
 what possibility is there 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 you can buy songs 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.440
 complements remember information is entered 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 recommendation 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.670
 with a capacity of 1 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.160
 but let's not talk about it 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.329
 find and add kabul 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.790
 their 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.570
 effects 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 5 subscriptions total 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.530
 as if not at all 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 I realized what kind of function 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.530
 let's let it go so let's 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.469
 we'll see 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.379
 how the programs themselves work 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.239
 release a little song 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.489
 this is a heavenly day to harmonize and let's 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 stabbed downtown 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.479
 it was expected that in those cities of the country 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.499
 but this quality is a matter of what is a 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.419
 among 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.939
 according to the Rosstat of Kirov 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.939
 the essence of the project is 200 thousand euros for Khimki 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.939
 defined everything correctly 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.999
 project idea 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.889
 it is correct except and even a picture album 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.299
 this is of course a computer 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.169
 that is, he determines everything 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.909
 Donetsk second and it is absolutely 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.629
 is free 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.939
 a year than the program is very good 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.379
 but of course free traffic to spend but there 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.779
 minimum and put a penny 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.169
 but gave and what program is worth 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.070
 to tell 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.989
 Well, right there tank 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.399
 like npf heart buck 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.289
 task man 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:15.739
 you are also a very interesting program 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.589
 i don't use it 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.959
 such a task manager 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.839
 he is very comfortable of him as it were 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.609
 in the meantime, the whole program shows open 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.139
 the price can still be shown here 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.329
 not visible now 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.299
 apt poorly focus 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.889
 but it looks like it shows 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.889
 trust less RAM 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.459
 among Egypt and skok left on them 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.179
 free space 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.719
 it is possible on the construction of this 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.949
 initially will not 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.069
 but we only because catch 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.299
 percent further here time second evening 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.559
 Watch the date for now, too, by the way 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.669
 comfortable enough 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.620
 does not mean 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.000
 Sochi and conveniently were Paharskoy programs 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.940
 as palms can look at us right away 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.909
 operational 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.860
 and his like 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.569
 keys to erase 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.719
 we can close this program very easily 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.639
 if a 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.149
 it doesnâ€™t even open thousands 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.059
 the person for me personally is convenient he 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.389
 called normal that is it loads not 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.709
 just a program 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.199
 but how is your usual dispatcher opened 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.189
 the race would replace the ordinary opens 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.349
 as well as refused usually that is there on 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.549
 center if you have a phone that's mine 

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:27.610
 eg 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.789
 that's what 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.240
 he opened the judges an hour replacing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.599
 the third program I would like 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.180
 mention this programs as lock 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.830
 Kurchatov go and I will not cut 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.350
 hide nothing to wait for the text 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.290
 crying so she is you 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.390
 now see here and this account Wednesday we already 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.630
 noticed he sends articles 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.719
 watch 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.249
 very cute I will not sharpen them 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.840
 attention at the construction site will not tell 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.310
 just everyone will say the supplies themselves all 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.169
 understand now the questions 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.169
 you will write those who are in the comments below 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.539
 right now pwc poorly visible fistula lighting is not 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.039
 very good 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.099
 but nevertheless it is visible that is 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.229
 and alas, all this can be built 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.539
 that is, it died a blow 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.099
 remnants of it like 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.330
 managed there soaked found kuyun 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.889
 clean resign gone 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.030
 do you see me in the morning 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.050
 supplies more often than poetically tax 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.460
 set the time well there too as now reports 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.610
 the ball is not very 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.460
 In general, you know the time as a request 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.490
 beauty 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.569
 But I look at 207, that is, one street among the food 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.349
 that big also 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.349
 here you do not see the antenna there tag 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.470
 captive signal and charge level 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.319
 batteries can also be set when 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.520
 message arrives 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.699
 or you haven't ruled out that you still 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.949
 big trips will protect here 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.480
 From messages beauty all such 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.530
 interesting things I really like 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.020
 programs called what 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.889
 with narrow closely with whom rusal news all 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.379
 references will also be below 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.129
 wire writing 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.129
 but it's probably all about own 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.879
 I don't know yet what else 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.209
 Demonstrate what program 7 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:11.659
 this box with the kidneys 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.310
 I will not they will force attention 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.779
 three cues in this issue 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.449
 said everything to everyone by 10 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.289
 about the video 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:21.719
 is useful 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.949
 and please subscribe 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.219
 good at least to cover 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.729
 for phones 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.439
 but the ocean 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:32.099
 As for the nokia itself, all yours have already taken off 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:32.939
 boxing 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:34.669
 speed him and other videos 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.919
 but as for the programs saw it 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.619
 will be 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:41.129
 hit the ball on the spot 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.650
 future winner in this subscribe 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.919
 I will be very pleased with everyone 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.749
 channel subscribers 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:49.649
 all packard in a meeting 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.059
 liked the song liked this 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:53.109
 mosque in the comments are not very pleasant 

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:55.259
 botanical who still looks 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:56.330
 bye everyone 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.599
 here the following form
