you guys can concede a little bit more
clearly<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> problem<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.490> i

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
clearly so now the problem here is i

have his arm in the back behind his head

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.850 
have his arm in the back behind his head
on<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.299> frame<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.500> end<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.799> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
on this frame but on the end of that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
on this frame but on the end of that
keyframe<00:01:35.310> his<00:01:35.579> hand<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.119> actually<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> front

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
keyframe his hand is actually in front

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
keyframe his hand is actually in front
of<00:01:37.020> his<00:01:37.140> head<00:01:37.400> so<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> people<00:01:38.850> would

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
of his head so now a lot of people would

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
of his head so now a lot of people would
have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> problems<00:01:39.869> trying<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> like

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
have a lot of problems trying to like

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.889 
have a lot of problems trying to like
figure<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.090> switch<00:01:42.600> everything

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
figure out how to like switch everything

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.889 
figure out how to like switch everything
up<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> also<00:01:43.530> his<00:01:43.829> face<00:01:44.159> changes<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.720> bunch

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
up and also his face changes and a bunch

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:46.850 
up and also his face changes and a bunch
of<00:01:45.990> other<00:01:46.140> stuff<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.590> I've<00:01:46.680> done<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
of other stuff so what I've done is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.410 
of other stuff so what I've done is
updated<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> new<00:01:47.520> quickly<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> handle<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
updated the new quickly to handle this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
updated the new quickly to handle this
kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> armed<00:01:48.930> issue<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> way<00:01:50.310> you'd<00:01:50.490> use

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
kind of armed issue so the way you'd use

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.670 
kind of armed issue so the way you'd use
it<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> figure<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.350> where

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it is first of all you figure out where

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
it is first of all you figure out where
your<00:01:52.890> arm<00:01:53.070> starts<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> lower<00:01:54.390> arm

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
your arm starts so this is the lower arm

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.660 
your arm starts so this is the lower arm
position<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:56.009> could<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> lower

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
position and I could see that the lower

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.280 
position and I could see that the lower
arm<00:01:56.850> moves<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.479> all<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
arm moves from here all the way up to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
arm moves from here all the way up to
there<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.820> do<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.020> go

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
there so what you can do is you can go

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.330 
there so what you can do is you can go
ahead<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.320> click<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> lower<00:02:01.829> arm<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
ahead and click on the lower arm and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
ahead and click on the lower arm and
change<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> label<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> anything<00:02:04.079> let's<00:02:04.590> say

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
change the label to anything let's say

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.249 
change the label to anything let's say
the<00:02:04.829> number<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.899> does<00:02:07.200> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the number one and what that does is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.020 
the number one and what that does is
give<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> reference<00:02:07.740> point<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.550> where<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.000> needs

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
give a reference point to where it needs

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.300 
give a reference point to where it needs
to<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:09.869> number<00:02:10.050> one<00:02:10.410> needs<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> go

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
to go so this number one needs to go

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
to go so this number one needs to go
over<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.090> labeled<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.599> symbol

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
over here so if I labeled that symbol

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220 
over here so if I labeled that symbol
same<00:02:13.490> name<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.330> let's<00:02:14.450> go<00:02:14.570> ahead<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.930> click<00:02:15.110> on

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
same name so let's go ahead and click on

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.310 
same name so let's go ahead and click on
the<00:02:15.350> frame<00:02:15.560> Nabal<00:02:15.950> at<00:02:16.130> one<00:02:16.660> now<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.990> that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the frame Nabal at one now that that

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.410 
the frame Nabal at one now that that
symbol<00:02:18.710> knows<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.220> reference<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.000> way<00:02:20.210> up

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
symbol knows to reference all the way up

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.870 
symbol knows to reference all the way up
to<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.990> symbol<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.950> kind<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.370> accommodate

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
to this symbol so kind of accommodate

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.400 
to this symbol so kind of accommodate
all<00:02:23.090> those<00:02:23.330> changes<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:23.900> let's<00:02:24.080> go<00:02:24.200> ahead<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
all those changes so let's go ahead and

it<00:02:55.940> will<00:02:56.000> see<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.660> keyframe<00:02:56.930> doesn't

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it will see that this keyframe doesn't

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.590 
it will see that this keyframe doesn't
have<00:02:57.620> an<00:02:57.740> end<00:02:57.950> keyframe<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.060> we'll<00:02:59.300> check

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
have an end keyframe so we'll check

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.480 
have an end keyframe so we'll check
where<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> black<00:03:00.230> key<00:03:00.440> frame<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.160> all

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
where the black key frame is and on all

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.560 
where the black key frame is and on all
the<00:03:01.640> layers<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:01.940> see<00:03:02.240> if<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.420> has<00:03:02.540> something

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
the layers and see if it has something

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.170 
the layers and see if it has something
that<00:03:03.200> matches<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.680> like<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.370> keyframe<00:03:04.790> over

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
that matches it like this keyframe over

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.880 
that matches it like this keyframe over
here<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.110> let's<00:03:06.230> go<00:03:06.320> ahead<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.470> test<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.800> out

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
here so let's go ahead and test it out

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.199 
here so let's go ahead and test it out
I'm<00:03:07.160> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> select<00:03:07.490> just<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.790> center<00:03:08.090> area

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
I'm going to select just the center area

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.860 
I'm going to select just the center area
press<00:03:08.840> seven<00:03:09.230> for<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.560> quick<00:03:09.770> tween<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.870> now

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
press seven for the quick tween and now

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.420 
press seven for the quick tween and now
this<00:03:12.050> is<00:03:12.200> kind<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> new<00:03:12.650> quick<00:03:13.250> between

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
this is kind of the new quick between

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.740 
this is kind of the new quick between
prompt<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.850> created<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.300> now<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.720> the

prompt I created you now have the
options<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.350> easing<00:03:15.740> both<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.340> or<00:03:16.760> out<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.600> I'm

options of easing both in or out so I'm

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.090 
options of easing both in or out so I'm
just<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:17.900> ahead<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.140> keep<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.590> both<00:03:18.800> and

just go ahead and keep it to both and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.340 
just go ahead and keep it to both and
the<00:03:20.090> tween<00:03:20.300> strength<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.690> going<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.870> be<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> 75

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
the tween strength is going to be a 75

the tween strength is going to be a 75
click<00:03:21.620> OK<00:03:21.950> it'll<00:03:22.700> take<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.880> little<00:03:23.180> bit<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> while

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
but it will save you a lot of time and

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.250 
but it will save you a lot of time and
there<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> go<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.700> done<00:03:25.910> go<00:03:26.660> ahead<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.110> hit

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
there you go it's done go ahead and hit

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.490 
there you go it's done go ahead and hit
enter<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.690> there<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.780> have<00:03:29.810> your<00:03:29.959> animation

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
enter and there you have your animation

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.930 
enter and there you have your animation
now<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.830> isn't<00:03:31.010> perfect<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.610> that's<00:03:31.730> because

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
now it isn't perfect and that's because

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.220 
now it isn't perfect and that's because
when<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.239> use<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.480> quick<00:03:32.630> clean<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.989> doesn't

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
when you use the quick clean it doesn't

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.560 
when you use the quick clean it doesn't
account<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:33.590> rotation<00:03:34.160> simply<00:03:35.000> because<00:03:35.330> it's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
account for rotation simply because it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.600 
account for rotation simply because it's
hard<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.930> predict<00:03:36.830> what<00:03:36.890> kind<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.190> drawings

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
hard to predict what kind of drawings

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.220 
hard to predict what kind of drawings
you<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:37.940> for<00:03:38.209> your<00:03:38.300> rotation<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:38.959> it's<00:03:39.140> an

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you have for your rotation if it's an

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.710 
you have for your rotation if it's an
arm<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.739> leg<00:03:39.769> ahead<00:03:40.370> but<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.330> doesn't<00:03:41.570> take<00:03:41.690> long

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
arm a leg ahead but it doesn't take long

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.750 
arm a leg ahead but it doesn't take long
to<00:03:41.900> kind<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.260> fix<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.620> up<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:43.370> kind<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.580> make<00:03:43.730> a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
to kind of fix it up to kind of make a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.759 
to kind of fix it up to kind of make a
look<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:43.970> little<00:03:44.090> bit<00:03:44.269> better<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.660> also<00:03:45.500> in

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
look a little bit better and also in

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.199 
look a little bit better and also in
this<00:03:45.920> stage<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.220> can<00:03:46.459> also<00:03:46.580> kind<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:46.940> spruce

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
this stage you can also kind of spruce

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.640 
this stage you can also kind of spruce
up<00:03:47.360> your<00:03:47.420> animation<00:03:47.900> by<00:03:47.989> giving<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.410> bit<00:03:48.560> of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
up your animation by giving it a bit of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.090 
up your animation by giving it a bit of
an<00:03:48.769> arc<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.410> just<00:03:51.500> going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> fix<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.040> up

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
an arc so I'm just going to fix it up

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.340 
an arc so I'm just going to fix it up
slightly

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
slightly

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.020 
slightly
just<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.040> kind<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.220> show<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.430> guys<00:03:55.550> how<00:03:55.610> would

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
just to kind of show you guys how would

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.260 
just to kind of show you guys how would
work

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.970 

and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.960> think<00:04:01.020> that's<00:04:01.200> okay<00:04:01.500> for<00:04:01.560> now<00:04:01.710> you<00:04:01.860> guys

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and I think that's okay for now you guys

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.370 
and I think that's okay for now you guys
kind<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.550> point<00:04:02.960> let's<00:04:03.960> go<00:04:04.080> ahead<00:04:04.230> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
kind of get the point let's go ahead and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.040 
kind of get the point let's go ahead and
play<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.830> animation<00:04:05.130> again<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.930> there<00:04:06.930> you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
play that animation again and there you

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.690 
play that animation again and there you
have<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.890> just<00:04:08.010> had<00:04:08.130> your<00:04:08.160> animation

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
have it you just had your animation

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.330 
have it you just had your animation
quickly<00:04:09.240> set<00:04:09.480> up<00:04:09.510> there's<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.560> cross<00:04:10.920> tween

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
quickly set up there's this cross tween

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.180 
quickly set up there's this cross tween
here<00:04:11.640> over<00:04:11.910> layers<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.990> that<00:04:13.070> wasn't<00:04:14.070> too<00:04:14.160> hard

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
here over layers so that wasn't too hard

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.950 
here over layers so that wasn't too hard
to<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.760> hope<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.120> guys<00:04:15.240> enjoy<00:04:15.630> then<00:04:15.870> you
