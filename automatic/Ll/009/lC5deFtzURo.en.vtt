00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
with this guy over here this is the PK

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.080 
with this guy over here this is the PK
zero<00:00:50.039> zero<00:00:50.370> three<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.989> looks<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
zero zero three this is what looks like

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.610 
zero zero three this is what looks like
and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.629> my<00:00:54.809> lips<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.969> but

and I have it on my lips right now but

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.209 
and I have it on my lips right now but
usually<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> would<00:00:59.399> apply<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.270> just

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
usually how I would apply this is just

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.899 
usually how I would apply this is just
dab<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.520> center<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.149> few<00:01:03.660> times<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.850> then<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
dab the center a few times and then I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.230 
dab the center a few times and then I
use<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.420> finger<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.159> blend<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.610> out

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.350 

almost<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> rate<00:01:12.960> gradient<00:01:13.830> effect<00:01:14.360> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
almost like a rate gradient effect so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.140 
almost like a rate gradient effect so
this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> looks<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.740> lips

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
this is what it looks like on my lips

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
this is what it looks like on my lips
and<00:01:18.950> then<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.280> watched

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.160 

here<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.039> is<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.429> as<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.909> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.149> it's<00:01:28.810> still

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
here it is and as you can see it's still

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.349 
here it is and as you can see it's still
in<00:01:29.350> its<00:01:29.530> liquid<00:01:29.770> form<00:01:29.979> right<00:01:30.429> now<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:30.909> after<00:01:31.119> a

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
in its liquid form right now but after a

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.219 
in its liquid form right now but after a
period<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.960> time<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.799> will<00:01:33.070> turn<00:01:33.520> into<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.630> more

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
period of time it will turn into a more

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.929 
period of time it will turn into a more
powdery<00:01:35.859> texture<00:01:37.109> so<00:01:38.109> this<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:38.469> again<00:01:38.770> PK<00:01:39.520> zero

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
powdery texture so this is again PK zero

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.580 
powdery texture so this is again PK zero
zero<00:01:40.240> three

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.399 

now<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.220> next<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:47.149> applied<00:01:47.479> here<00:01:47.960> is

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
now the next one I have applied here is

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.700 
now the next one I have applied here is
this<00:01:49.130> beige<00:01:49.460> color<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.470> b101

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
this beige color and b101

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.450 
this beige color and b101
and<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.930> believe<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.530> only<00:01:54.619> beige<00:01:55.130> color

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and I believe it's the only beige color

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.639 
and I believe it's the only beige color
they<00:01:55.670> do<00:01:55.729> have<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.509> here's<00:01:57.229> what<00:01:57.380> they<00:01:57.470> look

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
they do have and here's what they look

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.830 
they do have and here's what they look
like<00:01:57.680> on<00:01:58.039> my<00:01:58.280> lips

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
like on my lips

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.450 
like on my lips
and<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:01.610> when<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:01.939> swatch<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:07.220> color

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and then when I swatch it the color

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.110 
and then when I swatch it the color
looks<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:09.110> guy<00:02:09.319> over<00:02:09.440> here

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.729 

so<00:02:12.599> again<00:02:12.840> b.e<00:02:13.620> 101<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.599> moving<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.440> this

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
so again b.e 101 so moving on to this

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.930 
so again b.e 101 so moving on to this
last<00:02:17.040> color<00:02:17.489> it's<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.590> RT<00:02:19.590> 301<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:23.760> my

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.820 

so<00:02:34.770> here<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> red<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:37.040> RG<00:02:38.120> 301<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.530> in

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.190 
know when I first apply it it's fine but
after<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.470> would<00:05:10.710> say<00:05:11.130> even<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.419> three<00:05:12.660> hours<00:05:12.960> I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
after I would say even to three hours I

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.740 
after I would say even to three hours I
could<00:05:13.410> start<00:05:13.680> seeing<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.430> sinking<00:05:15.270> into<00:05:15.450> the

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
could start seeing it sinking into the

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.600 
could start seeing it sinking into the
lines<00:05:17.150> another<00:05:18.150> downside<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:19.200> that<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:20.130> terms

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
lines another downside is that in terms

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.680 
lines another downside is that in terms
of<00:05:20.789> how<00:05:21.090> long<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.479> lasts<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:22.950> would<00:05:23.430> say<00:05:24.000> for<00:05:24.479> me

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
of how long it lasts I would say for me

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.750 
of how long it lasts I would say for me
at<00:05:24.990> last<00:05:25.550> maybe<00:05:26.550> three<00:05:27.479> four<00:05:27.720> hours<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:29.340> of

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
at last maybe three four hours and of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.550 
at last maybe three four hours and of
course<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.240> from<00:05:30.360> eating<00:05:30.720> then<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.169> product

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
course it from eating then the product

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.940 
course it from eating then the product
is<00:05:31.710> gone<00:05:31.890> so<00:05:32.700> other<00:05:33.150> than<00:05:33.600> those<00:05:33.930> few<00:05:34.470> negative

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
is gone so other than those few negative

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.070
