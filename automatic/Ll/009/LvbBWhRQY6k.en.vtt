00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 this is a complete physical and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.510
 is in which the animal is in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 harmony and balance with the environment 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.080
 only when you speak state a complete 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.250
 Mental physical state this is very subtle 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 which is a complete state in the physical 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.350
 dog with animals 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.989
 run around playing and have fun at 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.110
 Truth is you offer for the dog 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.570
 or out of ways of expressing 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.660
 natural behaviors 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.550
 there is a whole stereotype of happiness 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.829
 for dogs as there is a stereotype of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.660
 happiness for the people 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.739
 the stereotype of happiness with a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 dog is the dog is running a beach 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.189
 in a park a little ball in the mouth with 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.710
 tongue out all tired but they in 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.340
 It's true that we think a dog 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.159
 shy you may not feel at ease in a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.049
 hot dog party force this 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 animal is in a space of 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.830
 unfortunately it is not reaching the maximum 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830
 of well being out there 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.400
 Who are we just do not have is not 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.800
 it's not simply having health well being 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.890
 it is not simply being healthy 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.020
 has a much bigger side, right? 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.570
 so the positive ones have not yet 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.729
 he is not sick, it 's okay to say no 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.340
 has a very large difference between not 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.740
 you are healthy you are physically healthy too 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.280
 without pain and being with the well-being 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.490
 hickmann is that an end stimulated with 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.830
 and has a law that comes from the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.380
 behavior and speech if the animal could 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.140
 do an old thing he's going to have 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.430
 to act to achieve the result or 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.769
 if it does not have to act have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.569
 result in front of him he will always 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.730
 preferred that he has to act because the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.480
 control and predictability are two 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.510
 factors 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.069
 so it is inherent to the 33 is part of the good 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.569
 animal being looks only at stress 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.400
 then you can not have control 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.670
 about his life about what he can 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.049
 about what it can achieve and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.870
 unpredictability of knowing what is going 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.569
 happen about a month 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.159
 the unstable are extremely important 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.420
 for the welfare of our people to live 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.370
 in an urban environment 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.459
 does not mean that dogs do not need 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.799
 have the opportunity to choose and 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.510
 expressing natural behaviors and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.760
 time that people enrich environment of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 a dog in his day to day a moment that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 He spends the day at feeding time. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.420
 at the time of the tour is less than the people 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.909
 will leave work and leave some 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.860
 elements of environmental enrichment 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.379
 that makes dogs express 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.819
 natural behaviors a behavior 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.420
 simple that we can stimulate all 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.410
 the days 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.769
 the behavior of the dog fails is already the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.269
 flagey upr the animal is very stimulating 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.909
 It's very challenging. 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.129
 the fact that the dog is looking for food 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.220
 a slightly larger space 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:34.019
 generates a series of positive feelings 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:36.450
 in that moment that every animal of the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.849
 mammal including humans a 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.220
 domestic cat a dog 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.380
 he has four basic instincts that 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.120
 the instinct of the home there the maternal instinct 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.069
 it is an instinct to escape the instinct of home 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.389
 the house there is maternal the great majority says 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.310
 peres 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.299
 this does not exist because they are 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.209
 castrated instinct of escape besides not 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.379
 be an instinct a pleasant no 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.889
 need because they live in a 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.470
 environment, the inmates are more 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.769
 stressors than animals 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.769
 wild in captivity 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.799
 the only behavior nothing that people 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.569
 can exploit to provide well 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.639
 being physical and mental 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.750
 it is the instinct to look for food that 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.549
 It's the type of house. 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.010
 So we stimulate the senses. 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.520
 animals we do the animal 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.980
 moving people encourages thinking 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.840
 for him to get the water bill 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.070
 preventive densification, we can 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.410
 Call so it will serve to show the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.580
 dog before showing you problems 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.620
 of behavior 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.700
 He was going to teach us how he did it. 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.140
 should behave is then this is the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.930
 first function of the leak and avoid 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.230
 behavior problems is after 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.630
 From this function we can and I 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.550
 I think it's the main one for whom 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.090
 really want to develop a bond with the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.430
 dog is to improve the communication to 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.040
 from the moment you train the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.840
 your dog you establish a path of two 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.150
 hands there you start to understand a lot 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.250
 better your dog than a show starts to 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.520
 I understand you much better 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.010
 What the direct benefit of this is 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.230
 dog all stress the dog 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.770
 usually the owner is reading 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.530
 before this premiere happens then it is 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.230
 before starting planning is common 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.930
 we see owners who did not realize that 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.760
 the dog was in the very stress state 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.060
 high stress constant stress 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.510
 chronic when you are training your 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.700
 dog and he is the owner he is oriented to 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.870
 observe these signs of stress 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.970
 through that of a conscious owner of the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.730
 what is happening with the field he is going 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.560
 able to have minimized the sessions that 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.850
 will make it stay much longer 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.820
 healthy 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.630
 mentally and obviously this reflects in 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.630
 all his health 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.840
 good communication between two parties 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:15.100
 increases the chance of a good 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:19.390
 relationship is good communication a 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.680
 family is a way to a good 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.470
 relationship 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.550
 a good relationship generates much more 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.070
 Happiness and much more is good 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.920
 being is much more than a trip 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.500
 on the block or a simple ball in the 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.770
 Great yard well being can be very 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.770
 more
