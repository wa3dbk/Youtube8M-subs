shotgun<00:00:15.630> free<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.500> excellent

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
shotgun free it's an excellent

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
shotgun free it's an excellent
application<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.029> because<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> free<00:00:18.750> app

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
application just because the free app

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.320 
application just because the free app
doesn't<00:00:19.380> mean<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.770> necessarily<00:00:19.890> bad<00:00:20.520> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
doesn't mean it's necessarily bad so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.330 
doesn't mean it's necessarily bad so
just<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.960> support<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.439> free<00:00:22.710> part<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
just to support the free part of it it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
just to support the free part of it it
has<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.609> ad<00:00:23.789> at<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:23.970> bottom<00:00:24.359> don't<00:00:24.930> worry

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

that'll go away when you launch it
instructions<00:00:27.390> are<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.689> simple<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.080> don't

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150 
review after this one it's going to be
more<00:00:56.910> in-depth<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> bigger<00:00:57.899> application<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
more in-depth on a bigger application so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.299 
more in-depth on a bigger application so
to<00:00:59.219> launch<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> shotgun<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> first<00:01:01.219> bring<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to launch the shotgun it first bring the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
to launch the shotgun it first bring the
camera<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.699> you're<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> pull<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.870> just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
camera up you're going to pull down just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
camera up you're going to pull down just
like<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> filter<00:01:04.710> real<00:01:04.860> shotgun<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.519> pull<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
like the filter real shotgun and pull it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170 
like the filter real shotgun and pull it
up<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.710> aim<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> go

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
up and then your aim it and then you go

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.530 
up and then your aim it and then you go
and<00:01:10.220> let<00:01:11.220> me<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.520> again<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.330> cool

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and let me do it again it's really cool

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.370 
and let me do it again it's really cool
actually<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> give<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
actually so I'm not going to give it a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
actually so I'm not going to give it a
rating<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.950> usually<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.790> giving<00:01:21.180> free

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
rating I usually don't like giving free

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
rating I usually don't like giving free
apps<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.290> rating<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> know

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
apps are rating because it's you know

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
apps are rating because it's you know
it's<00:01:23.369> free<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.110> were<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> give<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's free so if I were to give it a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's free so if I were to give it a
rating<00:01:25.860> though<00:01:26.220> i'd<00:01:26.490> probably<00:01:26.790> give<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.150> for<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
rating though i'd probably give it for a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.310 
rating though i'd probably give it for a
free<00:01:28.439> app<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.890> solid<00:01:29.790> seven<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
free app a solid seven just because you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
free app a solid seven just because you
know<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.250> unique<00:01:32.430> I've<00:01:32.729> never<00:01:32.880> seen

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
know it's really unique I've never seen

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
know it's really unique I've never seen
any<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:33.720> other<00:01:33.869> apps<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
any well there's other apps like this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
any well there's other apps like this
but<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.579> nailed<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.420> because

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
but this one actually nailed it because

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.149 
but this one actually nailed it because
I<00:01:36.930> mean<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.439> perfect<00:01:37.920> animation<00:01:40.159> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I mean it's perfect animation that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.840 
I mean it's perfect animation that's
just<00:01:41.400> perfect<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> shotgun<00:01:43.259> free<00:01:44.070> again<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just perfect so shotgun free again is a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.090 
just perfect so shotgun free again is a
seven<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> ten<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.340> try<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
seven out of ten it's just just try it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.170 
seven out of ten it's just just try it
