that<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.980> memory<00:00:26.430> game<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:27.240> it's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that it's not a memory game because it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.150

such<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> simple<00:00:28.619> little<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
such a simple little thing that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
such a simple little thing that
developers<00:00:29.369> did<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.269> putting<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:31.109> arrows

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
developers did just putting these arrows

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.139 
developers did just putting these arrows

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
on the back of the card so you just

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
on the back of the card so you just
point<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.540> arrow<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> whoever<00:00:34.079> place<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
point that arrow to whoever place the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
point that arrow to whoever place the
card<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.370> they've<00:00:35.700> got<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> nice<00:00:36.180> little

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
card so they've got a nice little

card so they've got a nice little
onboard<00:00:37.050> reminder<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.489> secret

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
but you know we know memory is a problem

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.490 
but you know we know memory is a problem
for<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.659> players<00:01:15.930> which<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> why<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.320> put<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
for some players which is why we put the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
for some players which is why we put the
arrows<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.490> brilliant<00:01:17.759> why<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
arrows on and that's so brilliant why I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
arrows on and that's so brilliant why I
mean<00:01:19.650> why<00:01:20.430> don't<00:01:20.490> more<00:01:20.700> games<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> mean

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
mean why don't more games do that I mean

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.340 
mean why don't more games do that I mean
there<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:21.960> games<00:01:22.200> out

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
there would be a lot more games out

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
game and it's a blast I mean it's easily

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.010 
game and it's a blast I mean it's easily
20<00:02:27.010> minutes<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.460> most<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.600> again<00:02:28.810> great

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
20 minutes at the most so again great

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.020 
20 minutes at the most so again great
filler<00:02:29.350> territory<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:30.010> suspect<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:30.880> more

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
filler territory I suspect with more

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.000 
filler territory I suspect with more
players<00:02:31.300> there'd<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.050> lot<00:02:32.290> more<00:02:32.350> chaos<00:02:32.860> so

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
players there'd be a lot more chaos so

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.870 
players there'd be a lot more chaos so
things<00:02:33.220> because<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.459> need<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.640> be<00:02:33.700> moving

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
things because they need to be moving

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.070 
things because they need to be moving
around<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.240> lot<00:02:34.330> you'd<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.720> work<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.930> lot

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
around a lot you'd have to work a lot

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.480 
around a lot you'd have to work a lot
harder<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.860> wouldn't<00:02:36.040> be<00:02:36.100> able<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:36.370> as

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
harder you wouldn't be able to do as

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.920 
harder you wouldn't be able to do as
much<00:02:36.610> advance<00:02:37.000> planning<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.660> much<00:02:37.780> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
much advance planning it to be much more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.840 
much advance planning it to be much more
tactical<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.560> response<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.160> you'd<00:02:39.640> need

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
tactical and response and you'd need

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.730 
tactical and response and you'd need
that<00:02:40.270> many<00:02:40.450> more<00:02:40.600> powers<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.320> have<00:02:41.560> more

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
that many more powers so you have more

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.160 
that many more powers so you have more
options<00:02:42.180> when<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> three<00:02:43.930> player

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
options when you have a three player

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.740 
options when you have a three player
game<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.980> first<00:02:45.130> player<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.360> first<00:02:46.540> round

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
game the first player in the first round

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.300 
game the first player in the first round
of<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.930> game<00:02:47.050> can<00:02:47.380> only<00:02:47.500> make<00:02:47.680> one<00:02:47.709> action<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
being last they get this which is an

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.479 
being last they get this which is an
extra<00:02:55.630> action<00:02:55.810> ticket<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.860> they<00:02:56.890> can<00:02:57.250> turn

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
extra action ticket that they can turn

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.740 
extra action ticket that they can turn
in<00:02:57.700> any<00:02:57.940> time<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.630> first

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
in any time they can do it in the first

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.420 
in any time they can do it in the first
round<00:02:59.050> or<00:02:59.140> any<00:02:59.290> round<00:02:59.530> they<00:02:59.680> want<00:02:59.920> where<00:03:00.400> they

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
round or any round they want where they

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.580 
round or any round they want where they
on<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:00.970> turn<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> do<00:03:01.660> three<00:03:01.959> actions<00:03:02.410> so

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
on one turn they can do three actions so

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.780 
on one turn they can do three actions so
that's<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.190> make<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.430> for<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.580> fact<00:03:03.730> that

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that's to make up for the fact that

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.340 
that's to make up for the fact that
they're<00:03:03.940> going<00:03:04.060> last<00:03:04.330> four<00:03:04.989> players

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
they're going last four players

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.570 
they're going last four players
interesting<00:03:05.830> because<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.190> becomes<00:03:06.400> a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
interesting because it becomes a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.520 
interesting because it becomes a
team-based<00:03:07.120> game<00:03:07.300> with<00:03:07.870> two<00:03:07.989> players<00:03:08.200> sitting

actually the rules say it's up to you

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.610 
actually the rules say it's up to you
whether<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.120> want<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.630> allow<00:03:16.840> players<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
whether you want to allow players you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.949

simple little game I was really doing my

simple little game I was really doing my
head<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.500> trying<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.980> keep<00:03:54.130> two<00:03:54.400> different

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
idea of what the game feels like maybe

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.720 
idea of what the game feels like maybe
not<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.620> best<00:03:59.650> way<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.920> play<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.400> might<00:04:00.610> have

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
not the best way to play I might have

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.220 
not the best way to play I might have
made<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> few<00:04:01.090> tactical<00:04:01.630> blunders<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.019> there

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
but hopefully you have a feel for it and
