if<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.760> had<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.970> whole<00:02:18.120> castle<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.750> maybe

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
if they had the whole castle so maybe

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.009 
if they had the whole castle so maybe
the<00:02:19.739> moving<00:02:20.129> staircases<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.239> would<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.810> some

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
the moving staircases that would be some

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.170 
the moving staircases that would be some
kind<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.410> trap<00:02:22.830> huh<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.879> moving

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

that<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.819> mentors<00:03:03.239> would<00:03:03.870> make<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.590> most

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that the mentors would make the most

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.210 
that the mentors would make the most
amazing<00:03:06.019> special<00:03:07.019> zombies<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> game<00:03:08.040> it

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
would be amazing but honestly I don't

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
would be amazing but honestly I don't
see<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.829> happening<00:03:10.980> any<00:03:11.579> time<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
see that happening any time in the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.880 
see that happening any time in the
future<00:03:12.209> unless<00:03:12.930> people<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.379> start<00:03:13.650> creating

us make our own zombie maps how sick

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.559 
us make our own zombie maps how sick
would<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.639> make<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.150> much<00:03:24.299> money

would that be they make so much money
off<00:03:24.720> us<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.950> i<00:03:26.099> would<00:03:26.310> i

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
off us just for doing that i would i

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.879 
off us just for doing that i would i

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
would pay to make my own map it would be

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.610 
would pay to make my own map it would be
sick<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.880> epic<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.359> guys<00:03:30.450> will<00:03:30.750> love<00:03:31.049> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
sick and epic and you guys will love to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.319 
sick and epic and you guys will love to
play<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.459> let's<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:32.819> back<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
play it but let's get back to the

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.030 
play it but let's get back to the
mentors<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.989> kind<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> think<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.829> their

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
mentors I kind of think that their

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.009 
mentors I kind of think that their
special<00:03:35.459> ability<00:03:35.849> would<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.480> every<00:03:36.870> like

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
special ability would be like every like

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.110 
special ability would be like every like
five<00:03:37.200> rounds<00:03:37.620> they<00:03:37.709> come<00:03:37.859> out<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.250> they

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
five rounds they come out and they

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.789 
five rounds they come out and they
chased<00:03:39.419> on<00:03:39.599> players<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.380> have<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.590> kill

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
chased on players and you have to kill

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.710 
chased on players and you have to kill
before<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.250> grab<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.910> what<00:03:42.480> they<00:03:42.569> would

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
before they grab you and what they would

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.589 
before they grab you and what they would
do<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.230> start<00:03:43.650> sucking<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.669> life<00:03:45.269> out<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.480> you

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
do is start sucking the life out of you

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.330 
do is start sucking the life out of you
but<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.349> would<00:03:46.470> actually<00:03:46.739> take<00:03:46.950> away<00:03:47.190> your

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
but it would actually take away your

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.370 
but it would actually take away your
point<00:03:47.609> so<00:03:47.970> your<00:03:48.569> points<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.109> slowly

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
point so your points with slowly

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.830 
point so your points with slowly
decrease<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.669> it'd<00:03:50.819> be<00:03:50.940> kind<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.180> hard<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.480> like

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
decrease so it'd be kind of hard to like

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.530 
decrease so it'd be kind of hard to like
buy<00:03:52.410> guns<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.280> pack<00:03:53.609> upon<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.239> think<00:03:54.359> that's

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
buy guns and pack upon so I think that's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
buy guns and pack upon so I think that's
a<00:03:54.690> perfectly<00:03:55.410> good<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.739> fact<00:03:55.950> if<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.220> guys

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
a perfectly good of fact if you guys

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.620 
a perfectly good of fact if you guys
like<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.760> let<00:03:56.910> me<00:03:56.970> come<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.269> tell<00:03:57.389> me<00:03:57.419> what

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
like that let me come and tell me what

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
almost like a transport like you see in

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.800 
almost like a transport like you see in
zombies<00:06:46.070> like<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:46.820> teleporters<00:06:47.420> so<00:06:47.630> maybe

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
zombies like the teleporters so maybe

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.690 
zombies like the teleporters so maybe
you<00:06:47.930> just<00:06:48.050> hop<00:06:48.260> on<00:06:48.440> these<00:06:48.530> brooms<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:49.190> they

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
you just hop on these brooms and they

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.520
