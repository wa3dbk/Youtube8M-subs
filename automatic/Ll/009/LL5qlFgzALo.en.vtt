00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.540

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.520
from nineteen sixty eight to nineteen
seventy-one dodge offered a scat pack

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.130
performance package on its dodge
challenger for 2015 that packages we lived

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.529
in the Challenger with this car

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.579
the 2015 dodge challenger r/t scat pack

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.970
now here's where it gets confusing it is
an RP

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.169
but there's not a whole lot of RT under
the hood under the hood is actually the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.760
6.4 liter v8 485 horsepower from the SRT
my dad says that's good to propel the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.170
Challenger r/t scat pack from 0 to 60 in
the mid for second range and do the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.330
quarter-mile mid 12

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.720
so why not just call it the srt

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.180
well the scat pack doesn't have a lot of
the expensive features that srt does

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.660
like the Viper inspired hood or the
adaptive suspension

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.079
it also has a different wheel package
the SRT has wider wheels and these are

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.950
optional

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.509
brembo brakes but they're only
four-piston calipers upfront compared to

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.640
those artis six-piston now what does
that do to price bubble the eight-speed

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.700
automatic transmission and the standard
six-speed manual transmission

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.640
come in around 39 thousand dollars for
the scat pack compared to 47 thousand

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.860
dollars for the manual transmission

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.680
srt

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
speaking of that eight-speed automatic
transmission

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.230
it is a highlight of the scat pack now
with the 485 horsepower v8

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.850
it's just a robust transmission that
shifts perfectly always finds the right

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.800
power band for the engine

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.510
it's just punchy and how it down ships
and we'll just throw you in the back of

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.500
your seat

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.460
the transmission is a fourteen hundred
dollar option

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.970
it's actually not a whole lot more
expensive in the manual transmission

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.050
because you don't get dinged with the
thousand-dollar gas guzzler tax because

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.790
of the eight speeds ratings which are 15
miles per gallon in the city and 25

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.220
miles per gallon on the highway helped
by cylinder deactivation word shuts down

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.290
four cylinders when you're at light
throttle with the scat pack comes an

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.920
active exhaust like the transmission

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.270
it is also a highlight of the scat pack
experience

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.600
I don't think I'd want to even think
about putting an aftermarket exhaust on

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.890
this it sounds so good that its speed
automatic transmission and always

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040
keeping those wonderful sounds in the
right places in the rev range

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.820
I've also spent time in the dragstrip
hero 707 horsepower challenger srt

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.989
hellcat now you may not think there
would be a whole lot of similarities

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.910
between the two because it's over 200
more horsepower but what was surprising

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.340
is that the Hellcat with its adaptive
suspension turn too comfortable mode and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.480
eco mode activated it was easier to
drive than this

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.310
scat pack in traffic and slippery
conditions that the scat pack is a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.830
fairly high strung car without the
ability to really turn down that those

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.950
sensitivities to the point where you can
with the Hellcat

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.220
now obviously there's twenty thousand
dollar difference and you might not be

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.150
looking at the two but it was a pretty
interesting note from my time in both

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.060
cars

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.459
prior to 2015 challenger had that retro
exterior and a retro inter which really

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.650
wasn't that night so it's pretty basic

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.370
nothing that you would want to spend a
lot of time and they read that

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.870
completely 4 2015 the new interior is
what we've grown to expect from new

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.550
chrysler vehicles

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.110
there's a lot of Technology materials
are nice it's a good way to spend a lot

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.110
of time on road trips

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.370
more just cruising around seats are
comfortable and there's still that same

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.610
challenger space on the inside it's a
big car and that space really shows when

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.650
you can fit in the backseat as an adult
and also have a lot of cargo space

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.850
the technology on the inside is anything
but

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.049
retro you have this great 8.4 inch
touchscreen that were a fan of an almost

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.190
every application also have features
like available adaptive cruise control

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.410
forward collision warning heated and
ventilated seats and heated steering

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.250
wheel

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.480
what I really like about the interior is
the eight-speed automatic transmissions

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.610
real gear selector not the electronic
one like use than other eight-speed

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.590
automatic transmissions and crisis line
up

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.150
there's a Park reverse neutral and drive
position that you can move back and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.470
forth plus you have these paddle
shifters that just worked fantastic very

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.930
very quick and responsive

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.480
unlike a lot of other non dual clutch
automatic transmissions this one shifts

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.450
very precisely with all of the optional
equipment on this particular scat pack

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.530
you're looking at a forty six thousand
dollars challenger one thing you don't

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.080
have to pay extra for is this wild
sublime green exterior color

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.370
I've met more neighbors in two days
driving this car then the two months

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.390
that i've lived there is coming out of
the woodwork asking about it i had more

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.660
attention in this than the 707
horsepower Hellcat do not buy this color

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.290
if you're not prepared to attract the
attention of every gear head within a

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.290
one-mile radius

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.990
yeah
