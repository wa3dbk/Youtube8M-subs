00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.780 

I<00:00:19.090> thought<00:00:20.090> that<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.990> bear<00:00:21.320> is<00:00:21.680> catching<00:00:22.520> the

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
I thought that the bear is catching the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.930 
I thought that the bear is catching the
fish<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.780> fish<00:00:23.990> is<00:00:24.200> catching<00:00:24.730> driving<00:00:25.730> five

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
fish the fish is catching driving five

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.020 
fish the fish is catching driving five
and<00:00:26.420> that<00:00:26.570> birds<00:00:26.840> just<00:00:27.290> I<00:00:27.680> guess<00:00:28.490> it's<00:00:28.700> going

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
and that birds just I guess it's going

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.630 
and that birds just I guess it's going
through<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.600> fish<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:31.040> Moose<00:00:31.250> is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
through the fish and the Moose is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.430 
through the fish and the Moose is
drinking<00:00:32.120> water<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.690> the<00:00:32.780> cab<00:00:32.960> that's

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.290 
drinking water in the cab that's
catching<00:00:33.740> the<00:00:34.130> other<00:00:34.309> bird<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:34.880> I<00:00:35.059> thought

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
catching the other bird and I thought

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.580 
catching the other bird and I thought
that<00:00:35.660> they're<00:00:35.960> all<00:00:36.050> just<00:00:36.080> trying<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:36.890> survive

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
three year program whereby the teachers

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.160 
three year program whereby the teachers
learn<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.770> strategy<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:02.420> their<00:01:02.540> classrooms

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
learn this strategy in their classrooms

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.630 
learn this strategy in their classrooms
and<00:01:03.530> then<00:01:03.770> they<00:01:03.890> come<00:01:04.100> here<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.550> museum

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.630 
and then they come here to the museum
and<00:01:05.300> also<00:01:05.900> can<00:01:06.200> use<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> strategy<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.550> the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
and also can use the strategy with the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.340 
and also can use the strategy with the
works<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.910> art<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.300> have<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.570> our<00:01:08.690> in<00:01:09.200> our

agree with part of what they said but

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.760 
agree with part of what they said but
now<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.450> want<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> add<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
now I want to add this to the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.260 
now I want to add this to the
conversation<00:04:25.220> or<00:04:25.790> add<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.360> thinking

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.470 

is<00:04:31.450> going<00:04:31.750> for<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.080> bird<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:33.790> disagree<00:04:34.450> I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
is going for the bird and I disagree I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.630 
is going for the bird and I disagree I
think<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:35.080> most<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:35.710> eating<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.400> grass

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
think that most is eating the grass

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.210 
think that most is eating the grass
because<00:04:37.360> it's<00:04:37.600> it's<00:04:38.260> similar<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.070> gas

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
because it's it's similar to the gas

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.630 
because it's it's similar to the gas
instead<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> water<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:41.170> I<00:04:41.950> agree<00:04:42.460> that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
instead of the water and I agree that

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.090 
instead of the water and I agree that
the<00:04:42.850> bear<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.600> going<00:04:44.020> for<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.470> fish<00:04:46.830> when<00:04:47.830> they

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
the bear is going for the fish when they

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.370 
the bear is going for the fish when they
summarize<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.120> talk<00:04:49.240> about<00:04:49.390> literacy<00:04:50.080> or

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
summarize and talk about literacy or

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.040 
summarize and talk about literacy or
when<00:04:50.590> they<00:04:50.770> observe<00:04:51.600> experiments<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.780> science

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
when they observe experiments in science

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.490 
when they observe experiments in science
or<00:04:53.620> when<00:04:54.610> their<00:04:54.940> use<00:04:55.450> doing<00:04:56.080> problem<00:04:56.380> solving

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
or when their use doing problem solving

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.400 
or when their use doing problem solving
in<00:04:56.800> math<00:04:56.980> those<00:04:57.280> same<00:04:57.550> skills<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.420> they<00:04:58.870> use

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
in math those same skills that they use

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.590 
in math those same skills that they use

the the patterning and thinking that

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.400 
the the patterning and thinking that
