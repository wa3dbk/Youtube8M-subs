00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
2011 NFL draft class we think about the

depth<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> problem<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.500> that's

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
depth is a problem and I think that's

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.590 
depth is a problem and I think that's
where<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.070> guy<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.430> Prince<00:04:17.640> Amukamara<00:04:17.880> can

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
