on<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.520> mean<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:45.029> were<00:01:45.149> some<00:01:45.359> studies

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on this I mean there were some studies

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.419 
on this I mean there were some studies
done<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.929> one<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> constituents<00:01:47.219> called

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
done on one of the constituents called

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.300 
done on one of the constituents called
skids<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.709> but<00:01:49.709> the<00:01:49.859> evidence<00:01:50.069> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
skids and all a but the evidence is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.699 
skids and all a but the evidence is
still<00:01:50.490> lacking<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.179> know<00:01:52.079> there's<00:01:52.319> not<00:01:52.469> been

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
still lacking you know there's not been

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.580 
still lacking you know there's not been
much<00:01:52.740> research<00:01:53.279> done<00:01:53.609> on<00:01:53.729> its<00:01:53.969> its

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
much research done on its its

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.870 
much research done on its its
effectiveness<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.799> terms<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.099> anti-aging<00:01:56.429> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
effectiveness in terms of anti-aging and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.919 
effectiveness in terms of anti-aging and
things<00:01:57.029> like<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.899> just

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
things like that a lot of that just

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.749 
things like that a lot of that just
stems<00:01:58.319> back<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.799> Chinese<00:01:59.249> medicine<00:01:59.639> uses

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
stems back to the Chinese medicine uses

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.059 
stems back to the Chinese medicine uses
for<00:02:00.119> them<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.289> there<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.529> anecdotal<00:02:01.829> uh

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
for them and so there is anecdotal uh

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.409 
for them and so there is anecdotal uh
but<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.369> always<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.669> issue<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.969> anecdotal

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:03.419 
but it's always the issue with anecdotal

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:05.149 
but it's always the issue with anecdotal
evidence<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.319> a<00:02:04.349> placebo<00:02:04.709> effect

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
evidence is a you have a placebo effect

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.099 
evidence is a you have a placebo effect
the<00:02:05.310> mind<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.639> quite<00:02:06.119> powerful<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.749> believing

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
the mind is quite powerful and believing

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.719 
the mind is quite powerful and believing
that<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.499> something<00:02:07.859> works<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.580> does

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that if something works then it does

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.900 
that if something works then it does
work<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.899> that's<00:02:10.140> hence<00:02:10.349> placebo

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
work and you know that's hence placebo

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.540 
work and you know that's hence placebo
there's<00:02:11.910> also<00:02:12.120> some<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:14.370> all

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
there's also some you know you get all

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.589 
there's also some you know you get all
those<00:02:14.700> per<00:02:14.880> fortify<00:02:15.209> there's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> lot<00:02:15.510> of

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
those per fortify there's a lot of

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.089 
those per fortify there's a lot of
variables<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> stuff<00:02:16.440> too<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.920> not

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
variables and stuff too that are not

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.040 
variables and stuff too that are not
adjusted<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.030> even<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.660> good<00:02:18.810> study

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
adjusted for even in a good study

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
adjusted for even in a good study
sometimes<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.709> later<00:02:19.980> adjusted<00:02:20.520> for<00:02:20.670> some

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
sometimes it's later adjusted for some

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.180 
sometimes it's later adjusted for some
of<00:02:20.849> these<00:02:20.940> variables<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.770> there<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.950> some<00:02:23.160> of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
of these variables so there is some of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.650 
of these variables so there is some of
that<00:02:23.280> evidence<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.820> believe<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.180> China<00:02:24.450> they

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
that evidence I believe in China they

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.089 
that evidence I believe in China they
say<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.290> sells<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.860> before<00:02:26.070> final<00:02:26.670> exam

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
say it's it sells out before final exam

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.319 
say it's it sells out before final exam
so<00:02:27.249> I<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.609> was<00:02:27.819> something<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.239> had

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
so I think was something that we had

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.319 
so I think was something that we had
read<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.609> grain<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.909> salt<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.209> so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
read so with the grain of salt that so

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.429 
read so with the grain of salt that so
you<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.540> take<00:02:31.689> that<00:02:31.719> now<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.139> being<00:02:32.349> said

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
you can take that now that being said

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.039 
you can take that now that being said
it's<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.040> pretty<00:02:33.280> cheap<00:02:33.819> inexpensive<00:02:34.180> product

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
it's a pretty cheap inexpensive product

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.020 
it's a pretty cheap inexpensive product
so<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.799> not<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.189> oh<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.579> gonna<00:02:36.700> break<00:02:36.909> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
so it's not like oh I'm gonna break the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.069 
so it's not like oh I'm gonna break the
bank<00:02:37.209> if<00:02:37.359> I<00:02:37.450> try<00:02:37.749> it

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
bank if I try it

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.660 
bank if I try it
based<00:02:38.469> on<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.739> anecdotal<00:02:39.249> evidence<00:02:39.310> that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
based on that anecdotal evidence that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.970 
based on that anecdotal evidence that
may<00:02:39.879> be<00:02:39.909> enough<00:02:40.359> in<00:02:40.540> terms<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.349> your<00:02:41.530> personal

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
may be enough in terms of your personal

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.949 
may be enough in terms of your personal
criteria<00:02:42.159> to<00:02:42.519> try<00:02:42.700> something<00:02:43.060> because<00:02:43.269> but<00:02:43.840> we

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
criteria to try something because but we

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.569 
criteria to try something because but we
can't<00:02:44.200> say<00:02:44.379> 100<00:02:44.680> percent<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:45.069> does<00:02:45.219> or<00:02:45.430> doesn't

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
can't say 100 percent it does or doesn't

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.089 
can't say 100 percent it does or doesn't
work<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.209> exactly<00:02:46.930> exactly<00:02:47.230> that's<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.859> case

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
work so exactly exactly that's the case

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.410 
work so exactly exactly that's the case
with<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> lot<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.700> pretty<00:02:48.909> cheap<00:02:49.090> what<00:02:49.299> is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
with a lot of it's pretty cheap what is

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.479 
with a lot of it's pretty cheap what is
this<00:02:49.569> place<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:50.019> think<00:02:50.049> it's<00:02:50.290> six<00:02:51.129> or<00:02:51.219> seven

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
this place I think it's six or seven

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.709 
this place I think it's six or seven
dollars<00:02:51.609> yes<00:02:52.000> somewhere<00:02:52.269> in<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.450> range

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
dollars yes somewhere in that range

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.659 
dollars yes somewhere in that range
that's<00:02:52.959> less<00:02:53.139> than<00:02:53.169> ten<00:02:53.500> dollars<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.099> if<00:02:54.459> you

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
that's less than ten dollars so if you

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.280 
that's less than ten dollars so if you
feel<00:02:54.849> like<00:02:55.030> hey<00:02:55.180> maybe<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.569> can<00:02:55.689> try<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.049> get

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
feel like hey maybe I can try and get

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.899 
feel like hey maybe I can try and get
focused<00:02:56.499> or<00:02:56.919> I'm<00:02:57.040> feeling<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:57.669> little<00:02:57.760> stressed

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
focused or I'm feeling a little stressed

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.720 
focused or I'm feeling a little stressed
I<00:02:58.269> mean<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.840> know<00:02:58.930> maybe<00:02:59.139> it'll<00:02:59.469> help<00:02:59.730> that's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
I mean you know maybe it'll help that's

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.459 
I mean you know maybe it'll help that's
something<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> consider<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:01.629> we<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.900> based

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
something to consider but we just based

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.229 
something to consider but we just based
on<00:03:02.590> our<00:03:02.680> typical<00:03:02.980> criteria<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.849> we<00:03:03.969> like<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
on our typical criteria what we like to

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.670 
on our typical criteria what we like to
look<00:03:04.359> for<00:03:04.510> human<00:03:04.780> evidence<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.469> know<00:03:05.530> we<00:03:05.650> just

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
look for human evidence you know we just

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.899 
look for human evidence you know we just
weren't<00:03:05.949> able<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.219> find<00:03:06.400> anything<00:03:06.669> it<00:03:06.730> doesn't

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
weren't able to find anything it doesn't

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:07.949 
weren't able to find anything it doesn't
mean<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.269> doesn't<00:03:07.419> work<00:03:07.599> it's<00:03:07.780> just

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
mean that it doesn't work it's just

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.030 
mean that it doesn't work it's just
there's<00:03:08.139> nothing<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.469> there<00:03:08.530> at<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.829> point

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
there's nothing out there at this point

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.610 
there's nothing out there at this point
yeah<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.030> then<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.480> into<00:03:10.629> what<00:03:11.260> was<00:03:11.409> said

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
yeah and then going into what was said

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.470 
yeah and then going into what was said
on<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.010> dr.<00:03:12.430> Oz<00:03:12.459> Show<00:03:12.730> or<00:03:12.879> mentioned<00:03:13.269> about

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
on the dr. Oz Show or mentioned about

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.259 
on the dr. Oz Show or mentioned about
this<00:03:13.810> particular<00:03:14.739> ingredient<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.180> it

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
this particular ingredient is that it

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.789 
this particular ingredient is that it
can<00:03:16.389> and<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:17.079> stimulate<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.530> central

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
can and can stimulate the central

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.129 
can and can stimulate the central
nervous<00:03:17.919> system<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.400> cause<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.389> get<00:03:19.540> an

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
nervous system and cause you to get an

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.379 
nervous system and cause you to get an
energy<00:03:20.409> energy<00:03:20.889> boost<00:03:21.129> basically<00:03:21.699> without

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
energy energy boost basically without

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.939 
energy energy boost basically without
the<00:03:22.750> jitters<00:03:23.109> or<00:03:23.139> without<00:03:23.500> consuming

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
the jitters or without consuming

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.539 
the jitters or without consuming
caffeine<00:03:24.540> he<00:03:25.540> purports<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.230> anti-aging

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
caffeine he purports it for anti-aging

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.740 
caffeine he purports it for anti-aging
younger<00:03:27.549> skin<00:03:27.939> memory<00:03:29.909> yeah<00:03:30.909> so<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.449> big

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
younger skin memory yeah so the big

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.300 
younger skin memory yeah so the big
thing<00:03:32.049> was<00:03:32.229> he<00:03:32.439> was<00:03:32.560> saying<00:03:32.769> was<00:03:32.919> for<00:03:33.069> anti

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
thing was he was saying was for anti

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.990 
thing was he was saying was for anti
aging<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.810> younger<00:03:34.810> skin<00:03:35.819> which<00:03:36.819> usually

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
aging and younger skin which usually

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.309 
aging and younger skin which usually
means<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.509> might<00:03:37.629> have<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> benefit<00:03:38.199> with

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
means it might have a benefit with

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.869 
means it might have a benefit with
glycation<00:03:38.709> because<00:03:39.040> glycation<00:03:39.189> is<00:03:39.669> thought

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
glycation because glycation is thought

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.059 
glycation because glycation is thought
to<00:03:39.909> be<00:03:40.060> what's<00:03:40.780> at<00:03:41.109> work<00:03:41.409> that<00:03:41.590> are<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.859> that

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
to be what's at work that are that that

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.740 
to be what's at work that are that that
sugar<00:03:42.459> that's<00:03:42.729> left<00:03:42.970> floating<00:03:43.359> around<00:03:43.479> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
sugar that's left floating around the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.759 
sugar that's left floating around the
body<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.139> combined<00:03:44.470> up<00:03:44.650> with

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
body that combined up with

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.800 
body that combined up with
polyunsaturated<00:03:45.129> fats<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.030> start<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.329> break

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
polyunsaturated fats and start to break

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.330 
polyunsaturated fats and start to break
down<00:03:46.840> collagen<00:03:47.530> which<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.889> protein<00:03:48.310> that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
down collagen which is the protein that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.189 
down collagen which is the protein that
you<00:03:48.879> know<00:03:49.000> makes<00:03:49.329> up<00:03:49.479> your<00:03:49.599> skin<00:03:49.870> kind<00:03:50.139> of

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
you know makes up your skin kind of

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.509 
you know makes up your skin kind of
that's<00:03:50.290> what<00:03:50.349> causes<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.919> wrinkling<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
that's what causes the wrinkling and the

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.369 
that's what causes the wrinkling and the
aging<00:03:51.879> sometimes<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:53.169> is<00:03:53.259> an

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
aging sometimes so and it is an

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.129 
aging sometimes so and it is an
antioxidant<00:03:53.650> -<00:03:54.220> okay<00:03:54.669> so<00:03:55.599> we<00:03:55.720> know<00:03:55.840> there<00:03:56.049> are

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
antioxidant - okay so we know there are

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.929 
antioxidant - okay so we know there are
some<00:03:56.349> mechanisms<00:03:56.949> of<00:03:57.099> action<00:03:57.220> we<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.759> don't

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
some mechanisms of action we just don't

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.390 
some mechanisms of action we just don't
know<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.150> what<00:03:58.299> degree<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:59.650> work<00:03:59.919> is<00:04:00.099> really

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
know to what degree they work is really

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.619 
know to what degree they work is really
what<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.609> comes<00:04:00.729> down<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.269> know<00:04:01.359> we<00:04:01.479> know

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
what it comes down to you know we know

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.270 
what it comes down to you know we know
what<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:01.959> not<00:04:02.439> only<00:04:02.560> purported<00:04:02.979> to<00:04:03.040> do<00:04:03.129> but

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
what it's not only purported to do but

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.920 
what it's not only purported to do but
what<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.489> mechanism<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.030> action<00:04:04.209> are<00:04:04.629> it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
what the mechanism of action are it

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.089 
what the mechanism of action are it
within<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.259> body<00:04:05.409> it's<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.769> question

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
within the body it's just the question

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.580 
within the body it's just the question
of<00:04:06.250> well<00:04:06.729> how<00:04:06.879> effective<00:04:07.419> is<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.569> at<00:04:07.840> X<00:04:08.079> Y<00:04:08.259> or<00:04:08.290> Z

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
of well how effective is it at X Y or Z

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.039 
of well how effective is it at X Y or Z
really<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.639> he<00:04:09.969> did<00:04:10.120> recommend<00:04:10.419> 500

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
really and he did recommend 500

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.020 
really and he did recommend 500
milligrams<00:04:11.439> per<00:04:11.680> day<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:12.489> solar<00:04:12.790> rays

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
milligrams per day the solar rays

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.149 
milligrams per day the solar rays
Cassandra's<00:04:13.629> 580<00:04:14.199> milligrams<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:14.889> right

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
Cassandra's 580 milligrams so right

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.550 
Cassandra's 580 milligrams so right
there<00:04:15.340> at<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:15.549> 500<00:04:16.120> milligram<00:04:16.419> per<00:04:17.229> day<00:04:17.409> and

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
there at that 500 milligram per day and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.050 
there at that 500 milligram per day and
it's<00:04:17.680> per<00:04:17.859> capsule<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.579> there's<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:18.820> hundred

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
it's per capsule so there's a hundred

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.569 
it's per capsule so there's a hundred
capsules<00:04:19.449> inside<00:04:19.719> here<00:04:20.159> another<00:04:21.159> common

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
capsules inside here another common

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.040 
capsules inside here another common
question<00:04:21.699> we<00:04:22.000> get<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.150> can<00:04:22.389> I<00:04:22.449> take<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.840> with

question we get is can I take this with

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320 
question we get is can I take this with
with<00:04:23.710> medicine<00:04:24.159> if<00:04:24.250> I'm<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.520> medication<00:04:24.909> can<00:04:25.270> I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
with medicine if I'm on medication can I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.629 
with medicine if I'm on medication can I
take<00:04:25.509> it<00:04:25.630> with<00:04:25.719> that<00:04:25.919> in<00:04:26.919> general<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:27.610> would

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
take it with that in general we would

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.820 
take it with that in general we would
say<00:04:27.909> should<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.180> fine<00:04:28.539> but<00:04:28.780> we'd<00:04:29.139> say<00:04:29.469> speak
