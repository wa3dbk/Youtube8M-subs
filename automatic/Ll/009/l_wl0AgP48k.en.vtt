00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.580
 olot in this last part of the 'club deal' we will lose to its end this 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.080
 situation almost always wanted to leave with the other groups as a state 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.079
 commenting whole in the previous days 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.869
 we have this situation 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.570
 suppose that our last three blocks were made the same is that they are 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.030
 the blue yellow the red yellow and the red 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.169
 blue 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.619
 and we have been placed in this way 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.070
 then diego lopez cicinho who acts as the corner correctly 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.930
 more than what we really have are three blocks 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.050
 that you have to throw 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 this block then it has to go here this is what has to go here this is what 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 you have to go here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.560
 we have to make a transitional government 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.630
 so it comes with fraud with what we know to do this and to the list because 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.480
 there was a lot of attention because 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.370
 It looks like corul curul we know that never 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.190
 the rubik's cube never presents a situation like this not that there is a 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.120
 corner only one corner that this rotated 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.540
 I do not exist but not without exception 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.390
 quite different at the time of turning 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710
 then I started the crisis and that is possible everything resolved less 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 a tea corner turn 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.090
 How do we solve this? 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.710
 but we already know how it is done 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.910
 by P 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.910
 romero coloma latina correctly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.740
 with the others 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.320
 The only thing that has to be done was not placed among other blocks 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 is percent and get 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 his post what here is fifth 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.830
 despite the previous points we already know that making movements of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.890
 I go up for example the left part the low health part and work the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.610
 right 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 ozú the south right and land his right bass under him want 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 percent because that permuted blocks 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.950
 the sense of the ordinary way then it is as simple as bringing this block 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 to a previous movement 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.570
 bring me this block 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.030
 bring it to me here then ran 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.549
 the provocation algorithm of four theological movements undo the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.820
 movements or another the block here 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.010
 then we start with the supreme this block here 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.839
 because nothing percent I bring 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.839
 I'm not going down gold came here 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 for what they are working I bring it here 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.859
 cry I bring it here 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.219
 all right 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.249
 but I already have my block located in me I want 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.289
 we waited three blocks one two three times what was wrong now I'm going to 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.619
 make the movement of promulgation of four movements the meaning of the 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.429
 tire then does not have sudden the corner as it is placed the blocks 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.059
 we'll see 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.059
 the 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.589
 Red 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.189
 the blue yellow 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.129
 I must go here 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.040
 the yellow red to live here because this team here procomer and I 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.589
 and that is that the proconsul has to come here 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.789
 we have to do so well like this 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 or almost turned on the day before yesterday 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.109
 then yes you will feel daily 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.379
 the wind raising the part the right part 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.290
 anyway 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.630
 and yes the one of the first part rises synde as in the right part wants 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.159
 what 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.539
 what is it worth up here 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.999
 then we see that it does not make sense antier to ricky to think about the part 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.729
 left 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.470
 ian stephen here here here I will give 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.350
 but in this case the pieces and that the blocks will be meaningless 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.069
 protected without meaning 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.749
 to the newspaper then 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.419
 raised today I do 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 right up 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.319
 for montilla la riva 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.819
 right under par 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.129
 in ticketea down 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.009
 let's see and work well 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.269
 Well, it's already 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.859
 since it is solved 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.129
 On the other hand, the sources 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.529
 this block that 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.819
 we took until he hung up when he returned it to the position where he was 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.019
 here of sanremo the movements 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.249
 land we did to position it 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.479
 they will want then that I liked kirk that I'm going to five 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.469
 I liked side was here the traitors 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.169
 4 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.379
 all right 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.379
 for was here 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.259
 she is not that it is already very easy to do these steps because the colors of the 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.150
 astana kazakhstan with a gun 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.659
 nor the goals that must be done 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.969
 that as is already resolved 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.020
 well then already to summarize 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:48.870
 of the entities that google has 12 blocks we are approaching the color of the block 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.159
 what determines these centers we look for the pieces of the edges the people we are 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.999
 in the block we insert the block 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:58.019
 according alavar alagón with those of the corners we are going to make a layer 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:00.040
 then the laterals did not come back superior 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.410
 We must be careful 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.610
 the normal thing is that when we solve all the blocks puesteros that in three 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.249
 badly placed blocks 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.639
 and to shorten the ones he attended as take them to the position that we know 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.719
 Well, if this population is 4 kilos here 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.559
 can be in any other position because we could have solved it from 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:18.490
 any 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.529
 another by sea because doing it by Peruvian layers 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.049
 they take the three in question here here here they join perth the 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:25.900
 permutation 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.050
 d what spain although it was the second fancy we add to the case 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.330
 and after that we do very well sad also backed what 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330
 propitiated in particular 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.460
 specifically the performance that is 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.380
 illán the cube that has solved the forest is a cube that mccann have 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.919
 removed rhythms is all a little bit of practice and hong kong or what are we going a 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.689
 couple of bp we already see that being spoiled the same and that is not 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.509
 they complicated us with balcony with others with other cubes 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.430
 porras pérez de tudela well help and we are not in prehistory
