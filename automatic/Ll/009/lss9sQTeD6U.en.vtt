this<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.190> we<00:00:11.280> call<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> start<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this is what we call the start of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.020 
this is what we call the start of the
bomb<00:00:12.240> site<00:00:13.130> so<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.429> all<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> details

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
bomb site so you can see all the details

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
bomb site so you can see all the details
here<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.170> bark<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> way<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
here of the of the bark and the way the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.140 
here of the of the bark and the way the
roots<00:00:17.550> come<00:00:17.880> down<00:00:18.890> it's<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.880> essential

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
roots come down it's really essential

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.620 
roots come down it's really essential
that<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.500> roots<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.340> flare<00:00:24.180> out<00:00:24.449> at

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that you have roots which flare out at

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
that you have roots which flare out at
the<00:00:24.720> base<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> trunk<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:26.130> grip<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the base of the trunk and they grip the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.400 
the base of the trunk and they grip the
ground<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.570> gives<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.160> real<00:00:29.160> strength<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
ground that gives it real strength a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.190 
ground that gives it real strength a
little<00:00:31.410> hollow<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.850> hollows<00:00:33.420> give<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
little hollow here now hollows give the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
little hollow here now hollows give the
impression<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.739> age<00:00:35.210> how<00:00:36.210> many<00:00:36.420> times<00:00:36.690> have

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
impression of age how many times have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
impression of age how many times have
you<00:00:36.930> walked<00:00:37.110> around<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> woods<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you walked around in the woods and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500 
you walked around in the woods and
places<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> little

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
places like that and you see a little

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
places like that and you see a little
hole<00:00:39.840> or<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> hollow<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> trunk<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
hole or a hollow in the trunk and you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
hole or a hollow in the trunk and you
just<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> peer<00:00:42.930> inside<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
just want to have a peer inside it and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.450 
just want to have a peer inside it and
see<00:00:44.040> what's<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:46.340> coming<00:00:47.340> up

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
see what's going on in there coming up

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
see what's going on in there coming up
you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.480> where<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> trunk<00:00:49.440> splits<00:00:49.860> we've

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can see where the trunk splits we've

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can see where the trunk splits we've
got<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> nice<00:00:50.700> detail<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> bark<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
got a nice detail in the bark here as it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
got a nice detail in the bark here as it
comes<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:55.020> flow<00:00:55.440> away

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
comes down and the two they flow away

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
comes down and the two they flow away
nicely<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.239> important<00:00:57.750> things<00:00:57.989> were

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
nicely and in important things were

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
nicely and in important things were
especially<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> twin<00:00:59.309> trunk<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.210> fact

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
especially on a twin trunk is the fact

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
especially on a twin trunk is the fact
that<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.050> main<00:01:01.410> trunk<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.980> always<00:01:02.250> slightly

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that the main trunk is always slightly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
that the main trunk is always slightly
larger<00:01:03.359> than<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> smaller<00:01:03.899> trunk<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
larger than the smaller trunk so that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
larger than the smaller trunk so that
you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.939> well<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:07.110> grew

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you can see well this one actually grew

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280 
you can see well this one actually grew
first<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.909> style<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.360> bonsai<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:10.020> call<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
first and this style of bonsai we call a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.940 
first and this style of bonsai we call a
mother<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> son<00:01:10.909> got<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> parent<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> then

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
mother and son got the parent and then

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.840 
mother and son got the parent and then
we've<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.700> child<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
we've got the child so here we have the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
we've got the child so here we have the
top<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> tree<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.470> lovely

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
top of the tree that have got lovely

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
top of the tree that have got lovely
little<00:01:20.310> curves<00:01:20.700> coming<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.840> way<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little curves coming all the way up and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.580 
little curves coming all the way up and
it<00:01:22.710> comes<00:01:22.979> down<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> tiny<00:01:24.320> wispy<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it comes down to this tiny wispy little

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
it comes down to this tiny wispy little
branch<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> top<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.200> we've<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
branch at the top here so we've got a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.499 
branch at the top here so we've got a
beautiful<00:01:28.650> taper<00:01:29.310> from<00:01:29.610> start<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> bottom

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
beautiful taper from start to bottom

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.719 
beautiful taper from start to bottom
within<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.320> say<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.920> another<00:01:35.070> 50

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
within I would say in about another 50

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.440 
within I would say in about another 50
years<00:01:36.320> probably<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.130> half<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> amount

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
years probably will have half the amount

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350 
years probably will have half the amount
of<00:01:39.600> branches<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> branch

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
of branches that you see now as a branch

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.100 
of branches that you see now as a branch
grows<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.470> occupies<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.100> space<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
grows it occupies more space so what you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.969 
grows it occupies more space so what you
end<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:47.270> two<00:01:48.270> branches<00:01:48.979> competing

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
end up with is two branches competing

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
end up with is two branches competing
for<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:50.430> space<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> what

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
for the same space and this is what

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560 
for the same space and this is what
happened<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.680> normal<00:01:52.950> tree<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.220> well<00:01:53.570> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
happened in a normal tree as well so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.810 
happened in a normal tree as well so
basically<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.740> light<00:01:56.040> factor<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:57.299> start<00:01:57.899> to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
basically the light factor will start to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
basically the light factor will start to
become<00:01:59.820> more<00:02:00.270> important<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> each<00:02:01.110> branch<00:02:01.549> one

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
become more important to each branch one

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.910 
become more important to each branch one
branch<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.119> shadow<00:02:03.450> another<00:02:04.290> branch<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
branch will shadow another branch and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.530 
branch will shadow another branch and
that<00:02:05.759> branch<00:02:06.030> won't<00:02:06.270> grow<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> shadow

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
that branch won't grow in the shadow

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that branch won't grow in the shadow
so<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.800> will<00:02:09.490> start<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.030> remove<00:02:10.360> branches<00:02:10.720> as

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
so I will start to remove branches as

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.220 
so I will start to remove branches as
with<00:02:11.890> nature<00:02:12.480> removing<00:02:13.480> branches<00:02:13.660> from<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
with nature removing branches from a

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.680 
with nature removing branches from a
bonsai<00:02:14.620> tree<00:02:14.650> must<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.220> quite<00:02:15.460> daunting<00:02:15.880> yeah

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
bonsai tree must be quite daunting yeah

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.050 
bonsai tree must be quite daunting yeah
I<00:02:16.720> actually<00:02:17.410> find<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.800> best<00:02:18.040> way<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.340> do<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.910> is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I actually find the best way to do it is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.600 
I actually find the best way to do it is
I<00:02:19.090> sit<00:02:19.450> down<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.050> take<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.710> good<00:02:20.980> look<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
I sit down I take a good look at the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.920 
I sit down I take a good look at the
bonsai<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.940> close<00:02:25.210> my<00:02:25.240> eyes

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
bonsai and then I just close my eyes

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.740 
bonsai and then I just close my eyes
pick<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> Clippers<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.370> just<00:02:27.940> have<00:02:28.720> a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
pick up the Clippers and just have a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.780 
pick up the Clippers and just have a
good<00:02:29.050> clipping<00:02:29.500> session<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.220> hope<00:02:30.580> that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
good clipping session and just hope that

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.040 
good clipping session and just hope that
I<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:31.600> really<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.720> that's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
I get the right one really and so that's

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.220 
I get the right one really and so that's
absolute<00:02:35.530> rubbish<00:02:35.710> I'm<00:02:36.040> eventually<00:02:37.230> could

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
absolute rubbish I'm eventually could

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.800 
absolute rubbish I'm eventually could
you<00:02:38.410> show<00:02:38.980> us<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.490> branch<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.420> might<00:02:40.630> be

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
you show us a branch that you might be

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.900 
you show us a branch that you might be
considering<00:02:41.440> would<00:02:41.710> be<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.250> chop<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
considering would be for the chop if you

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.750 
considering would be for the chop if you
like<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.750> would<00:02:44.140> probably<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:47.460> either<00:02:48.460> this

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
like it would probably be either this

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.670 
like it would probably be either this
one<00:02:49.000> or<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.330> at<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.050> moment<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:50.650> not

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
one or this one at the moment I'm not

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.340 
one or this one at the moment I'm not
sure<00:02:51.160> because<00:02:52.030> there<00:02:52.150> are<00:02:52.210> other<00:02:52.300> facts<00:02:52.780> this

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
sure because there are other facts this

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.890 
sure because there are other facts this
branch<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.820> opposite<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.300> branch<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
branch here is opposite to branch at the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.070 
branch here is opposite to branch at the
back<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.290> tree<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:57.130> branch<00:02:57.460> is<00:02:58.120> actually

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
back of the tree this branch is actually

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.350 
back of the tree this branch is actually
coming<00:02:59.709> from<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.860> same<00:03:00.190> point<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> trunk

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
coming from the same point on the trunk

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.080 
coming from the same point on the trunk
as<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.780> branch<00:03:02.080> here<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.730> gives<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
as this branch here so it gives the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
as this branch here so it gives the
impression<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.930> we<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.680> what<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:06.130> call<00:03:06.250> a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
impression that we have what we call a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.360 
impression that we have what we call a
bar<00:03:06.670> branch<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.320> two<00:03:08.500> branches<00:03:08.800> almost

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
bar branch so the two branches almost

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.350 
bar branch so the two branches almost
continue<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.240> cut<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.690> trunk<00:03:10.870> off<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:13.090> this

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
continue and cut the trunk off so this

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.820 
continue and cut the trunk off so this
is<00:03:13.420> another<00:03:13.900> thing<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.410> have<00:03:14.650> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
is another thing that we have to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.229 
is another thing that we have to
consider<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:15.400> we're<00:03:15.580> moving<00:03:15.700> branches

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
consider when we're moving branches

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.060 
consider when we're moving branches
there<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.480> many<00:03:16.780> many<00:03:17.050> factors<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
there are many many factors and the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.430 
there are many many factors and the
older<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.640> tree<00:03:18.880> becomes<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.750> more<00:03:20.020> we<00:03:20.230> have

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
older the tree becomes the more we have

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.380 
older the tree becomes the more we have
to<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.920> think<00:03:21.340> about<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.209> we're

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
to just think about which one we're

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.020 
to just think about which one we're
going<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.690> doing<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:24.130> where<00:03:24.489> do<00:03:24.580> people<00:03:24.640> get

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
going to be doing so where do people get

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
going to be doing so where do people get
their<00:03:25.180> inspiration<00:03:25.390> from<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.380> mean<00:03:26.769> when<00:03:27.100> you

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
their inspiration from I mean when you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.560 
their inspiration from I mean when you
know<00:03:27.430> people<00:03:27.760> aren't<00:03:27.910> going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.120> be<00:03:28.180> starting

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
know people aren't going to be starting

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.270 
know people aren't going to be starting
on<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.690> tree<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.320> all<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.709> no<00:03:30.070> they're

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
on a tree like this all right no they're

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.330 
on a tree like this all right no they're
not<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:32.050> a<00:03:32.140> very<00:03:32.320> good<00:03:32.500> point<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:33.070> think

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
not and it's a very good point I think

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.090 
not and it's a very good point I think
the<00:03:34.239> inspiration<00:03:34.720> changes<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.830> more<00:03:35.950> you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the inspiration changes the more you

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.310 
the inspiration changes the more you
start<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.400> grow<00:03:36.610> first<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.300> all<00:03:38.610> most<00:03:39.610> people

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
start to grow first of all most people

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.990 
start to grow first of all most people
start<00:03:41.320> off<00:03:41.530> with<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:42.250> little<00:03:42.459> bonsai<00:03:42.670> that

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
start off with a little bonsai that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.570 
start off with a little bonsai that
they're<00:03:43.150> given<00:03:43.450> perhaps<00:03:44.290> or<00:03:45.070> they<00:03:45.280> might<00:03:45.430> have

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
they're given perhaps or they might have

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.900 
they're given perhaps or they might have
seen<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.850> picture<00:03:46.390> in<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.630> book<00:03:47.340> or<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.640> looks

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
seen a picture in a book or that looks

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.630 
seen a picture in a book or that looks
good<00:03:49.120> I'd<00:03:49.239> like<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.480> have<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> go<00:03:49.810> at<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.640> once

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
good I'd like to have a go at that once

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.660 
good I'd like to have a go at that once
you<00:03:51.820> started<00:03:52.360> growing<00:03:52.600> bonsai<00:03:53.670> your

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
you started growing bonsai your

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.220 
you started growing bonsai your
inspiration<00:03:55.269> really<00:03:55.570> should<00:03:55.900> come<00:03:56.110> from

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
inspiration really should come from

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.580 
inspiration really should come from
trees<00:03:56.560> themselves<00:03:57.239> by<00:03:58.239> going<00:03:58.989> out<00:03:59.170> into<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
trees themselves by going out into the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.800 
trees themselves by going out into the
woods<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.280> fields<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.030> looking<00:04:01.540> at<00:04:01.690> the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
woods and the fields and looking at the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.170 
woods and the fields and looking at the
trees<00:04:02.080> because<00:04:02.290> they<00:04:03.160> will<00:04:03.459> teach<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.970> more

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
growing bonsai see how the different

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.310 
growing bonsai see how the different
shapes<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.610> forms<00:04:10.030> where<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.480> branches<00:04:11.080> come

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
shapes are forms where the branches come

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.750 
shapes are forms where the branches come
from<00:04:11.590> all<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.860> different<00:04:12.160> shapes<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:12.610> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
from all the different shapes and the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.319 
from all the different shapes and the
curves<00:04:13.350> what<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.470> weather<00:04:14.830> has<00:04:15.250> done<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:16.299> that

curves what the weather has done to that

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.710 
curves what the weather has done to that
tree<00:04:16.480> and<00:04:17.139> how<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.560> grown<00:04:18.389> these<00:04:19.389> are<00:04:19.660> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
tree and how it's grown these are the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.440 
tree and how it's grown these are the
things<00:04:19.989> these<00:04:20.380> are<00:04:20.590> my

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
things these are my

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.640 
things these are my
now<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.090> changes<00:04:24.990> first<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.470> think

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
now so it changes first of all I think

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.440 
now so it changes first of all I think
