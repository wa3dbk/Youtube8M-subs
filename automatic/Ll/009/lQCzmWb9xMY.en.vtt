00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.430
 the year ends with boxing including 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.440
 year of several bright fights involving 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.370
 Russian boxers primarily 4 as 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.929
 at least here is the question on the boxer and you can 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.379
 In principle, all answer which fight is more 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.420
 just liked Povetkin Lebedev 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.410
 much ameli hero enters there no 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.010
 mickey rurk go to another maybe 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.010
 imitates on 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.930
 before the Russian boxer is interested 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 Kirov them I would be dramatic 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 circumstances marked the victory of sergei 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.350
 Kovalev nad Bernard Hopkins I think 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.660
 wounded third and fourth sergey 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.750
 felt for himself that he could 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 fight finish finish ahead of time and need 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 understand what boxing is and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.199
 the size of the soul and the Russian guy 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.300
 earring who didn't you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 watched this fight I think that such 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.270
 assessment 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.570
 one must agree this outstanding victory 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 in Russia there was really real 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 the absolute world champion is a man who 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.610
 united title did it in america 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 so he think you need to admit that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 Today, the best Russian boxer is Sergey 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.340
 kovalev 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 my opinion is conscious according to 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 I agree 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.550
 what are you 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.660

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.850
