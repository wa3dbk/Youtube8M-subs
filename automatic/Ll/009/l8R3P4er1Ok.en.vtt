00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.320
 olei I had 72 thousand and well I did a trick 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.300
 object 5 online in version 1.2 and 7 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.009
 to enter inside the military base and 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.840
 in what is gta 5 jail without that 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.310
 put us stars is worth a trick 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.890
 because we can do it without level or 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.720
 nothing is worth without having to level 1 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.150
 and without any money requirement so 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 what is a trick worth apart this is going 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.570
 to last the whole game and it will be both 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 the military base like in prison like that 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.010
 what good or think how it is done and good 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.530
 to start here us to the creator mode and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 create a catch in contention is worth this 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.680
 we 're going to do it once we're just going to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.750
 create a catch and we can do the 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.190
 trick if we want a hundred times okay let's go 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.199
 to put the name capture a name 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.180
 Short is worth any name can be 1 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.350
 eleven 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.909
 so to go faster a description 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.739
 the same is worth a short description for 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.180
 give us 0 and a picture we make 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.799
 Any photo that we caught is worth I was 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.720
 and do it at the military base 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.189
 the capture because it can do 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.049
 where we want then good 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.479
 we will limit equipment a point in 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.340
 each one we go there's more here and we'll put 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.740
 of vehicle we are going to put the hunt worth 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.170
 that they fight 0 then well we will put 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.680
 hunting on both teams then now 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.690
 must go 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.530
 environmental adjustments and putting cops 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.700
 pedestrians the no traffic not in resources in 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.040
 does not vary or is the services of 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.260
 emergency and finally we put bands 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.729
 in nova of everything in not once done this 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.950
 let's go back and let's put 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.020
 what I put is worth more but just 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.479
 here weapons and we only forced 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 let's put the lever arms worth a 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.150
 Once we lock this one, we will give it to activate 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 we are going to place the activator in 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.180
 anywhere this does not matter they 're worth 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.950
 any place that lets us place it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.479
 I can not do it at the military base 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.740
 we make another photo of what is the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.660
 split double that in the chamber of the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 room now you just have to leave 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.560
 teams and place four points of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 team of a few points worth slogans the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.950
 team 2 and we will place another 4 points 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.290
 points that have to be separated from the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.940
 team 1 ok we're going to go now to the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.770
 capture area and we will place the area 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.630
 capture of team one on team 1 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.890
 ok we stick it to the side and I for example 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.270
 here I'm wrong and I put it on the computer 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.280
 2 you have to put it on the computer 1 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.630
 to make it all much faster but 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.950
 I'm really not caring what you put 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.440
 worth this is the one that is faster the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.870
 game you are not going to give here is worth the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.250
 area of this to put the briefcases and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.870
 we will put it more or less in the middle of what 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.340
 what are the two teams worth this is not 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.080
 it matters as I said before but it's 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.430
 just to make it faster 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.750
 now we have to create what is the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.460
 capture that we are going to use to make 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.380
 the trick is now what needs to be done 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.820
 is to give it to try and good for there 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.810
 to try it so that rockstar leave us 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.670
 save the vouchers we will try 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.770
 first in team 1 we take a 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.330
 briefcase and we deliver it to which we are already going 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.220
 to take about five seconds to walk 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.810
 Then put a test with the equipment 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.580
 1 let's wait here fifteen seconds 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
 after it's finished and we'll taste it 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.780
 with the team 2 is more followed in the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.280
 team 2 and approve let's do 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.690
 Exactly the same thing, we'll take a 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 briefcase we will go back and we 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.200
 we will put here in the circulito once 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.000
 as proof what is team 1 and the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.950
 team 2 you just have to save the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.270
 game is worth it because if we do not try the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.100
 team there is no team 2 we can not 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.410
 save the then we will save 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.030
 We are going to give you one that we will give you 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.290
 to come out what you need to do is load 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.670
 the game that we have created is worth 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.560
 let's give to load a creation it's going 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.870
 to take a saved and we select 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.820
 our catch that is going to be the 111 in 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 my case then when we are in the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.150
 capture menu let's give it to 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.250
 try and select the equipment 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.630
 you wait for us to load and we're going to 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.340
 be here to take the briefcase 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.050
 we will take the briefcase and what there is to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.790
 to do is to deliver what is worth 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.500
 we take it because we delivered it and 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.630
 fix that when we have a screen 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.650
 like yellow it's going to be here 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.349
 have to give 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.939
 online play online gt5 and we will get 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.319
 in public session okay I want me to 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.329
 they work private but I have not tried 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.500
 with which I do not have a session and 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.180
 you can see what the points are going to give us 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.189
 but it means that the trick has 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.720
 worked perfectly, it's good and I'm good 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.549
 I think the part of creating the catch 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.079
 a lot of people to look very messy worth 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.120
 so my recommendation is that 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.280
 go stopping the video is worth for example 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.810
 when he took away all the police removed him 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.970
 the bit of just stop if you do 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.439
 Exactly the same as what I wear is worth 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.970
 It makes it much easier to be able to 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.859
 grow in the online world and I'm going to 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.269
 advance the video is equal I have to 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.859
 cut the video because I could not get myself 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.269
 in the military base it's worth and the only time 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.159
 that got it I have fallen with the car 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.299
 on my back and I'm dead and good here 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.010
 you can see that I am inside the base 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.170
 military and they do not put me stars is worth 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.629
 which is a trick hour to explain a 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.099
 good and bad thing of the trick is worth the thing 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.900
 who has this trick is to do it 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.849
 with let's say lester huarmey tonic no 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.959
 they are going to work for us and well I will 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.269
 decide what to do to make the functions 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 always the ester and the mechanic are worth 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 that go to be online activities at 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.970
 activity system created by rotating 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.889
 races and we will get into any 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.509
 load of rockstar then you go to 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.550
 confirm the settings will not leave for 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.169
 select a car in the menu to 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.819
 select a car you have to give it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.650
 and we stick to what the race is 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.150
 ballet and it automatically goes for 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 fix this failure to be able to call 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.229
 lester and the mechanic and we will also have 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.699
 the trick to not have police in any 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.710
 site so good I'll leave you the 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.999
 video with music and good finally you 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.469
 I will remember that if you want to do the 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.419
 trick again you do not have to see the 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.219
 starting again, what should be done is 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.259
 go to the creator mode let's load a 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.999
 saved creation as the creation to 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.590
 we are going to give to test equipment 1 between 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:56.509
 massa briefcase and consoles with yellow 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.039
 we will get in the online vale is 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.779
 just do the last person that 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.909
 believe in the game again so 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.499
 good to youtube like to comment and 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.419
 subscribe and we are friends for this 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:08.110
 piece another case would be perfect so 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.110
 good bye 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.960
 with a point 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.349
 by a 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.770
 yes 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.560
 no no
