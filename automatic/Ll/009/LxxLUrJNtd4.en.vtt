00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.450 

in<00:00:00.599> one<00:00:00.870> of<00:00:00.900> my<00:00:01.050> previous<00:00:01.350> videos<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.220> went

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
in one of my previous videos I went

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.400 
in one of my previous videos I went
through<00:00:02.730> what<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.210> natural<00:00:03.689> law<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.140> went

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
through what is natural law and I went

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.099 
through what is natural law and I went
through<00:00:04.650> how<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.920> theory<00:00:05.609> works<00:00:05.899> but<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:06.960> this

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
through how the theory works but in this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.540 
through how the theory works but in this
video<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.440> want<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.680> look<00:00:07.830> at<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.040> strengths

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
video I want to look at the strengths

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.490 
video I want to look at the strengths
and<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.880> weaknesses<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.929> natural<00:00:10.380> law

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
and the weaknesses of the natural law

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.669 
and the weaknesses of the natural law
theory<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.820> let's<00:00:12.300> start<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.049> strengths

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
theory so let's start with the strengths

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.090 
theory so let's start with the strengths
well<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.130> absolutist<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.179> deontological

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
well it's absolutist and deontological

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.340 
well it's absolutist and deontological
theory<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.970> means<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.359> allows<00:00:18.840> clear

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
theory so this means that allows clear

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.160 
theory so this means that allows clear
common<00:00:19.890> rules<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.520> established<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.480> from

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
common rules to be established and from

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
common rules to be established and from
these<00:00:22.350> clear<00:00:22.769> common<00:00:23.160> rules<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.760> they

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
these clear common rules because they

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
these clear common rules because they
are<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.689> know<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.080> easily<00:00:25.699> distinguished<00:00:26.699> we

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
are you know so easily distinguished we

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.839 
are you know so easily distinguished we
can<00:00:27.420> form<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.900> structured<00:00:28.560> society<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.730> that's

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
can form a structured society so that's

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
can form a structured society so that's
wrong<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> strengths<00:00:30.720> another<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.920> it's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
wrong the strengths another one it's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.459 
wrong the strengths another one it's
like<00:00:32.520> cat<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.360> based<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.899> compassion

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
like cat it's not based on compassion

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.430 
like cat it's not based on compassion
feeling<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.520> immersions<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.780> based<00:00:37.140> on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
feeling or immersions it's based on

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560 
feeling or immersions it's based on
innate<00:00:37.829> human<00:00:38.100> reason<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.760> counts<00:00:39.180> based<00:00:39.360> on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
innate human reason what counts based on

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
innate human reason what counts based on
more<00:00:39.750> intuitive<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> does<00:00:40.980> well<00:00:41.219> based<00:00:41.430> on

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
more intuitive is does well based on

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
more intuitive is does well based on
reason<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> place<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.629> NH<00:00:43.020> human<00:00:43.500> reason<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
reason this place of NH human reason and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.580 
reason this place of NH human reason and
innate<00:00:44.940> human<00:00:45.210> reason<00:00:45.690> doesn't<00:00:45.870> change<00:00:46.260> like

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
innate human reason doesn't change like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
innate human reason doesn't change like
feelings<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:47.700> remains<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.360> always

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
feelings what remains right always

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.240 
feelings what remains right always
remains<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.649> remains<00:00:49.980> wrong

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
remains right and what remains wrong

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
remains right and what remains wrong
always<00:00:50.489> remains<00:00:50.910> wrong<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.260> means<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
always remains wrong so this means that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
always remains wrong so this means that
when<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.579> conduct<00:00:54.030> an<00:00:54.360> action<00:00:54.870> we're<00:00:55.050> not

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
when we do conduct an action we're not

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.229 
when we do conduct an action we're not
doing<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.829> simply<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> edge<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
doing is simply out the edge of the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
doing is simply out the edge of the
moment<00:00:57.660> we're<00:00:57.840> doing<00:00:58.100> something<00:00:59.100> more<00:00:59.399> we're

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
moment we're doing something more we're

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
moment we're doing something more we're
doing<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.149> we<00:01:00.390> feel<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
doing because we feel that it's the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.380 
doing because we feel that it's the
right<00:01:02.309> wrong<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.359> our

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
right wrong because that's what our

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
right wrong because that's what our
reason<00:01:03.930> tells<00:01:04.199> us<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:04.979> which

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
reason tells us and it's something which

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.080 
reason tells us and it's something which
is<00:01:05.369> unchanged<00:01:06.090> again<00:01:06.720> an<00:01:06.900> absolutist<00:01:07.650> trade

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
is unchanged again an absolutist trade

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
is unchanged again an absolutist trade
it's<00:01:09.090> also<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> great<00:01:09.990> method<00:01:10.530> used<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's also a great method used by the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
it's also a great method used by the
Catholic<00:01:11.700> denomination<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.630> especially

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
Catholic denomination and especially

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.710 
Catholic denomination and especially
where<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> Bible<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> silent<00:01:15.060> genetic

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
where the Bible is silent genetic

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
where the Bible is silent genetic
engineering<00:01:16.229> IVF<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.520> the

engineering IVF all these things the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
engineering IVF all these things the
Bible<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.270> silent<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> rely<00:01:19.350> on

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
Bible is silent we have to rely on

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
Bible is silent we have to rely on
another<00:01:19.590> ethical<00:01:20.280> theory<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> natural

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
another ethical theory which is natural

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.370 
another ethical theory which is natural
law<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.619> universal<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.759> even<00:01:24.000> though<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
law it's universal so even though it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
law it's universal so even though it's
known<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:26.009> common<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.229> Catholicism

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
known to be common with the Catholicism

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
known to be common with the Catholicism
it's<00:01:28.770> universal<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> does<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.420> really

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's universal it does it's not really

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's universal it does it's not really
limiting<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.560> any<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.790> race<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.720> gender

limiting to any kind of race or gender

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
limiting to any kind of race or gender
anything<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> based<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> reason

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
anything because it's based on reason

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.929 
anything because it's based on reason
which<00:01:36.119> everyone<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.460> why<00:01:38.700> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
which everyone has so that's why it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.410 
which everyone has so that's why it's
really<00:01:39.150> universal<00:01:40.079> spray<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.740> can't<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
really universal spray it like can't and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.620 
really universal spray it like can't and
we<00:01:42.420> can't<00:01:42.750> predict<00:01:43.140> consequences<00:01:44.009> ok<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we can't predict consequences ok so that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
we can't predict consequences ok so that
was<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> weakness<00:01:46.020> 3<00:01:46.470> till<00:01:46.770> turn-ins<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.460> we

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
was the weakness 3 till turn-ins that we

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.020 
was the weakness 3 till turn-ins that we
can't<00:01:47.880> produce<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:50.369> predict

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can't produce and we like predict

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
can't produce and we like predict
consequences<00:01:51.869> therefore<00:01:52.649> when<00:01:52.979> natural<00:01:53.430> law

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
consequences therefore when natural law

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
consequences therefore when natural law
is<00:01:53.640> based<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.090> their<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> intrinsic

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
is based on their just on the intrinsic

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.800

it<00:02:53.319> gives<00:02:53.650> flexibility<00:02:54.430> say<00:02:54.730> even<00:02:55.209> though

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
it gives flexibility say even though

it gives flexibility say even though
Cannes<00:02:55.959> for<00:02:56.410> example<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.100> would<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.250> very

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
Cannes for example it would be very

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.630 
Cannes for example it would be very
inflexible<00:02:58.299> some<00:02:58.959> would<00:02:59.140> say<00:02:59.349> I'm<00:03:00.099> not<00:03:00.370> sure

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
inflexible some would say I'm not sure

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.009 
inflexible some would say I'm not sure
I'd<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.760> more<00:03:01.120> flexible<00:03:01.360> because<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.870> got

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
I'd be more flexible because it's got

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:02.759 
I'd be more flexible because it's got
casuistry

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
casuistry

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.190 
casuistry
and<00:03:03.010> we<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.540> basically<00:03:04.870> means<00:03:05.019> we

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
and we can like this basically means we

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.380 
and we can like this basically means we
can<00:03:05.349> interpret<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.190> rules<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.670> apply<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.060> our

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
can interpret the rules to apply to our

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.930 
can interpret the rules to apply to our
situation<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:09.190> know<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.519> not<00:03:09.670> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
situation and you know it's not so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.150 
situation and you know it's not so
hardcore<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.810> must<00:03:11.049> not<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.980> can

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
hardcore you must not do this you can

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
hardcore you must not do this you can
interpret<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.970> different<00:03:13.480> ways<00:03:15.030> similarly<00:03:16.030> on

interpret in different ways similarly on

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.940 
interpret in different ways similarly on
the<00:03:16.299> same<00:03:16.569> hand<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:16.989> have<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> weakness<00:03:17.650> that

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
the same hand we have a weakness that

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.190 
the same hand we have a weakness that
casuistry<00:03:18.700> by<00:03:19.120> many<00:03:19.359> critics<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.019> used

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
casuistry by many critics is used

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.830 
casuistry by many critics is used
pejoratively<00:03:20.670> because<00:03:21.670> how<00:03:21.970> can<00:03:22.390> something

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
pejoratively because how can something

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.410 
pejoratively because how can something
which<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.290> an<00:03:23.470> absolutist<00:03:24.190> theory<00:03:24.670> be<00:03:25.359> so

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
which is an absolutist theory be so

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.370 
which is an absolutist theory be so
relativist<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.959> what<00:03:29.079> I<00:03:29.140> mean<00:03:29.350> that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
relativist if you see what I mean that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.309 
relativist if you see what I mean that
you<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:30.310> there's<00:03:30.640> no<00:03:31.239> like<00:03:31.510> clear-cut<00:03:32.079> rules

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
you is there's no like clear-cut rules

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.319 
you is there's no like clear-cut rules
functioning<00:03:33.010> because<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.519> apply<00:03:34.000> and

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
functioning because you can apply and

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.660 
functioning because you can apply and
what<00:03:34.959> people<00:03:35.200> say<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:36.130> know<00:03:36.280> people

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
what people say is that you know people

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.059 
what people say is that you know people
use<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.180> clever<00:03:37.660> arguments<00:03:38.470> with<00:03:38.590> casuistry

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
use like clever arguments with casuistry

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.699 
use like clever arguments with casuistry
to<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.549> out<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.850> moral<00:03:40.269> kind<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.810> principles

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
to get out of moral kind of principles

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.009 
to get out of moral kind of principles
which<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:42.040> know<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.549> there<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.180> some<00:03:43.660> people

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
which you know are there so some people

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.590 
which you know are there so some people
you<00:03:44.650> know<00:03:44.680> they<00:03:44.799> would<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.130> not<00:03:45.579> be<00:03:46.150> happy

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
you know they would just not be happy

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.440 
you know they would just not be happy
with<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.560> also<00:03:47.799> based<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.579> assumptions

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
with that it's also based on assumptions

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.670 
with that it's also based on assumptions
so<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.769> example<00:03:51.870> Aquinas<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.109> God<00:03:53.470> created

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
so for example Aquinas is a God created

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.960 
so for example Aquinas is a God created
the<00:03:54.100> world<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.639> if<00:03:55.480> we<00:03:55.540> do<00:03:56.109> not<00:03:56.260> fulfill<00:03:56.769> its

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the world and if we do not fulfill its

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.640 
the world and if we do not fulfill its
purpose<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.600> fullest<00:03:59.019> then<00:03:59.470> this

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
purpose to the fullest then this

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.479 
purpose to the fullest then this
imperfection<00:04:00.750> however<00:04:01.750> how<00:04:02.680> do<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:03.069> know<00:04:03.250> this

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
imperfection however how do we know this

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.210 
imperfection however how do we know this
is<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:04.180> actually<00:04:04.299> true<00:04:04.780> if<00:04:05.019> all<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.709> this<00:04:05.889> Val's

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
is it actually true if all of this Val's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.069 
is it actually true if all of this Val's
and<00:04:06.519> if<00:04:06.579> there<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.880> no<00:04:07.090> God<00:04:07.389> where<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.660> so

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
and if there is no God where the so

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.110 
and if there is no God where the so
called<00:04:08.440> moral<00:04:08.709> law<00:04:08.950> comes<00:04:09.310> from<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.910> whole

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
called moral law comes from the whole

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.500 
called moral law comes from the whole
theory<00:04:10.450> felt<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.470> know<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.120> what's<00:04:13.120> more

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
theory felt so you know and what's more

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.539 
theory felt so you know and what's more
is<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.840> it's<00:04:14.139> based<00:04:14.410> on<00:04:14.650> naturalistic

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
is that it's based on naturalistic

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.110 
is that it's based on naturalistic
fallacy<00:04:16.000> which<00:04:16.989> means<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.700> basically<00:04:18.700> we

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
fallacy which means that basically we

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.690 
fallacy which means that basically we
say<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.660> moral<00:04:20.470> law<00:04:20.620> comes<00:04:20.919> from<00:04:21.130> God<00:04:21.370> well

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
say that moral law comes from God well

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.450 
say that moral law comes from God well
we<00:04:21.880> didn't<00:04:22.150> say<00:04:22.270> Aquinas<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.900> fact<00:04:23.320> we<00:04:24.220> ought

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
we didn't say Aquinas is fact we ought

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.340 
we didn't say Aquinas is fact we ought
to<00:04:24.490> follow<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.690> that's<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.320> judgment

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
to follow it that's the judgment

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.740 
to follow it that's the judgment
from<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.770> fact<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.400> there<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> moral<00:04:29.600> law

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
from a fact that there is a moral law

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.170 
from a fact that there is a moral law
saying<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.410> should<00:04:30.710> kind<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.730> follow<00:04:31.970> it

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
saying that we should kind of follow it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.510 
saying that we should kind of follow it
that<00:04:32.420> would<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.990> judgment<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:34.040> people<00:04:34.400> are

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
that would be a judgment so people are

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.490 
that would be a judgment so people are
saying<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.120> can't<00:04:35.420> move<00:04:35.810> logically

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
saying that you can't move logically

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.610 
saying that you can't move logically
from<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.130> factory<00:04:37.430> judgment<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.260> people

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
from a factory judgment and so people

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.890 
from a factory judgment and so people
say<00:04:39.950> that<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.250> know<00:04:40.490> sorry<00:04:40.880> necessary<00:04:41.690> to

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
say that you know sorry necessary to

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.780 
say that you know sorry necessary to
just<00:04:42.380> follow<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:42.920> judgment<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.610> know<00:04:43.640> you

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
just follow that judgment you know you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.820 
just follow that judgment you know you
can<00:04:44.180> identify<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.990> rules<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.620> lot

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
can identify the rules and a lot

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.000 
can identify the rules and a lot
follower<00:04:47.290> consequences<00:04:48.290> are<00:04:48.530> what's<00:04:48.740> more

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
follower consequences are what's more

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.210 
follower consequences are what's more
important<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:50.060> it<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.750> actual<00:04:50.930> action<00:04:51.740> itself

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
important is it the actual action itself

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.340 
important is it the actual action itself
or<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.730> it<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.910> consequence<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:53.900> example

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
or is it the consequence so for example

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.890 
or is it the consequence so for example
if<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.620> are<00:04:54.800> hiding<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.370> Jew<00:04:56.000> in<00:04:56.300> like<00:04:56.630> the

if you are hiding a Jew in like the

if you are hiding a Jew in like the

your doorstep
what's<00:05:00.920> one<00:05:01.160> point<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.640> you<00:05:01.790> don't<00:05:02.000> lie<00:05:02.390> and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
what's one point that you don't lie and

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.510 
what's one point that you don't lie and
you<00:05:02.720> tell<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.170> truth<00:05:03.350> or<00:05:04.010> is<00:05:04.310> there<00:05:04.490> more

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
you tell the truth or is there more

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.640 
you tell the truth or is there more

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
to protect the people's lives what is

to protect the people's lives what is
more<00:05:09.470> important<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.390> you<00:05:11.390> can't<00:05:11.720> work<00:05:12.140> out

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
more important and you can't work out

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.260 
more important and you can't work out
the<00:05:12.590> purpose<00:05:13.010> of<00:05:13.190> everything<00:05:13.700> because<00:05:14.090> it's

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
the purpose of everything because it's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.620 
the purpose of everything because it's
really<00:05:14.570> not<00:05:14.870> easy<00:05:15.200> for<00:05:15.800> example<00:05:16.420> according<00:05:17.420> to

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
really not easy for example according to

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.620 
really not easy for example according to
the<00:05:17.930> Catholic<00:05:18.590> Church<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.160> sex<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.210> there<00:05:20.420> for

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
the Catholic Church and sex is there for

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.020 
the Catholic Church and sex is there for
procreation<00:05:21.110> but<00:05:21.590> critics<00:05:22.340> would<00:05:22.580> say<00:05:22.640> it's

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
procreation but critics would say it's

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.450 
procreation but critics would say it's
not<00:05:23.210> just<00:05:23.780> for<00:05:23.930> procreation<00:05:24.410> isn't<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.160> is

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
not just for procreation isn't it it is

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.640 
not just for procreation isn't it it is
for<00:05:25.700> enhancing<00:05:26.300> relationships<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:27.260> their

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
for enhancing relationships and their

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.410 
for enhancing relationships and their
birth<00:05:27.860> of<00:05:28.130> equal<00:05:28.580> weight<00:05:28.760> because<00:05:29.150> not

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
birth of equal weight because not

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.900 
birth of equal weight because not
everyone<00:05:29.870> has<00:05:30.130> sex<00:05:31.130> for<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.550> have<00:05:31.670> children

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
everyone has sex for to have children

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.970 
everyone has sex for to have children
it's<00:05:32.270> also<00:05:32.480> to<00:05:32.660> like<00:05:33.020> enhance<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.830> strengthen

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
it's also to like enhance and strengthen

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.940 
it's also to like enhance and strengthen
relationships<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.810> which<00:05:36.110> one<00:05:36.410> of<00:05:36.440> them<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:36.920> a

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
relationships but which one of them is a

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.600 
relationships but which one of them is a
primary<00:05:37.610> purpose<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:39.170> know<00:05:39.290> you<00:05:39.610> disrobe

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
primary purpose you know you disrobe

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.700 
primary purpose you know you disrobe
because<00:05:41.150> it's<00:05:41.300> not<00:05:41.450> consensus<00:05:42.140> on<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.350> ah

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
because it's not consensus on that ah

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.820 
because it's not consensus on that ah
you<00:05:43.370> know<00:05:43.490> how<00:05:43.700> can<00:05:43.940> this<00:05:44.030> theory<00:05:44.480> function<00:05:45.050> so

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
you know how can this theory function so

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.720 
you know how can this theory function so
that<00:05:46.270> was<00:05:47.270> why<00:05:48.340> basically<00:05:49.340> there's<00:05:49.550> the

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
that was why basically there's the

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.720 
that was why basically there's the
strengths<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.150> weaknesses<00:05:50.270> of<00:05:50.870> natural<00:05:51.470> law

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
strengths and weaknesses of natural law

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.270 
strengths and weaknesses of natural law
overall<00:05:52.730> it's<00:05:53.060> not<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.420> bad<00:05:53.810> theory<00:05:54.220> but<00:05:55.220> I

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
overall it's not a bad theory but I

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.790 
overall it's not a bad theory but I
think<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:55.760> assumptions<00:05:56.510> that<00:05:56.780> is<00:05:56.900> based<00:05:57.260> on<00:05:57.590> I

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
think the assumptions that is based on I

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.490
