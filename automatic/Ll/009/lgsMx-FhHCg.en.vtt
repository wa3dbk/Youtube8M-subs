process<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.270> gel<00:02:03.509> fiber<00:02:03.719> gel<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
process of gel fiber gel but for the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749 
process of gel fiber gel but for the
sake<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> video<00:02:04.979> I'll<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.430> speed<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
sake of the video I'll try and speed it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.420 
sake of the video I'll try and speed it
up<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.149> bit<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.520> coat<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.629> gel<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
up here a little bit so coat of gel and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.570 
up here a little bit so coat of gel and
then<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.510> gel<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:13.379> out

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
then put your gel down get out

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.790 
then put your gel down get out
fibers<00:02:13.910> let's<00:02:14.060> talk<00:02:14.240> about<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:14.630> okay<00:02:15.050> so

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
fibers let's talk about these okay so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.530 
fibers let's talk about these okay so
let's<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.100> say<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.460> open<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.970> up<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.360> it's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
let's just say you open this up and it's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.840 
let's just say you open this up and it's
loaded<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.530> full<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.830> fibers<00:02:19.250> you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
loaded like this full of fibers you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.680 
loaded like this full of fibers you
don't<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.930> twist<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.950> off<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
don't want that so twist it off in the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.800 
don't want that so twist it off in the
middle<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.380> your<00:02:24.470> cap<00:02:24.740> until<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:26.150> really<00:02:26.450> looks

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
middle of your cap until it really looks

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
middle of your cap until it really looks
like<00:02:26.930> there's<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> lot<00:02:27.710> less<00:02:27.920> fibers<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.460> there

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
like there's a lot less fibers on there

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.700 
like there's a lot less fibers on there
and<00:02:28.820> even<00:02:29.480> twist<00:02:29.780> them<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.050> there<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.530> kind

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
and even twist them on there just kind

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.560 
and even twist them on there just kind
of<00:02:30.740> pinch<00:02:31.580> them<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.270> they're<00:02:32.390> nice<00:02:32.510> and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
of pinch them so that they're nice and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
of pinch them so that they're nice and
tight<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.500> don't<00:02:33.530> want<00:02:33.710> loose

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
tight on there you don't want loose

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.980 
tight on there you don't want loose
fibers<00:02:34.460> loose<00:02:34.970> fibers<00:02:35.360> are<00:02:35.480> gonna<00:02:35.600> end<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.870> all

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
fibers loose fibers are gonna end up all

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.960 
fibers loose fibers are gonna end up all
over<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> place<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.220> don't<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.700> back<00:02:37.790> in

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
over the place so don't put it back in

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.180 
over the place so don't put it back in
your<00:02:38.060> fiber<00:02:38.300> tube<00:02:38.870> set<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> down<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.710> then<00:02:40.130> you

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
your fiber tube set it down and then you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.650 
your fiber tube set it down and then you
have<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.460> little<00:02:40.610> guy<00:02:40.790> ready<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.210> go<00:02:41.330> and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
have this little guy ready to go and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.630 
have this little guy ready to go and
then<00:02:42.620> we're<00:02:42.770> gonna<00:02:42.860> start<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> gel

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
then we're gonna start with the gel

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.360 
then we're gonna start with the gel
again<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.740> said<00:02:45.890> make<00:02:46.040> sure<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.250> don't

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
again like I said make sure you don't

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.550 
again like I said make sure you don't
have<00:02:46.460> any<00:02:46.610> excess<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> tip<00:02:47.390> no<00:02:48.200> excess

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
have any excess on the tip no excess

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.140 
have any excess on the tip no excess
down<00:02:48.830> here<00:02:49.040> on<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.310> bottom<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.850> don't<00:02:50.000> want

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
down here on the bottom we don't want

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.540 
down here on the bottom we don't want
any<00:02:50.270> gel<00:02:50.600> getting<00:02:50.900> anywhere<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.709> then<00:02:52.400> we're

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.510 
any gel getting anywhere and then we're
gonna<00:02:52.640> start<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:54.020> on<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> tips<00:02:54.590> okay<00:02:54.830> you

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
gonna start just on the tips okay you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.560 
gonna start just on the tips okay you
don't<00:02:55.700> need<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> go<00:02:56.000> down<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> base

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
don't need to go down to the base

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.210 
don't need to go down to the base
anymore<00:02:57.020> because<00:02:57.170> you've<00:02:57.410> really<00:02:57.740> loaded<00:02:58.100> it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
anymore because you've really loaded it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.500 
anymore because you've really loaded it
up<00:02:58.340> down<00:02:58.580> there<00:02:58.640> at<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> bottom<00:02:59.120> we're<00:02:59.420> gonna

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
up down there at the bottom we're gonna

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.360 
up down there at the bottom we're gonna
just<00:02:59.780> focus<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.560> tips<00:03:01.030> backs<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.370> fronts

you<00:04:18.169> can<00:04:18.410> build<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:19.000> but<00:04:20.000> if<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.209> go<00:04:20.359> really

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
you can build this but if you go really

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.110 
you can build this but if you go really
fast<00:04:20.989> trying<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> seal<00:04:21.890> those<00:04:22.550> fibers<00:04:22.970> on

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
fast trying to seal those fibers on

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.990 
fast trying to seal those fibers on
you're<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:23.960> gonna<00:04:24.110> pull<00:04:24.320> them<00:04:24.470> off<00:04:24.880> but<00:04:25.880> if

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
you're just gonna pull them off but if

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.250 
you're just gonna pull them off but if
you<00:04:26.120> go<00:04:26.300> really<00:04:26.630> slow

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
you go really slow

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.940 
you go really slow
you're<00:04:27.890> gonna<00:04:28.100> get<00:04:28.660> high-impact<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.920> a

you're gonna get high-impact I have a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.380 
you're gonna get high-impact I have a
lot<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.190> fibers<00:04:31.520> on<00:04:31.670> my<00:04:31.760> eyelid<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.210> that's

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
lot of fibers on my eyelid but that's

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.850 
lot of fibers on my eyelid but that's
okay<00:04:32.660> I'm<00:04:32.780> not<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.290> looking<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
okay I'm not really looking in the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.770 
okay I'm not really looking in the
mirror<00:04:34.160> that's<00:04:34.280> why<00:04:34.550> they'll<00:04:35.390> come<00:04:35.570> right<00:04:35.720> off

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
mirror that's why they'll come right off

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.120 
mirror that's why they'll come right off
okay<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> always<00:04:39.380> finish<00:04:39.920> with<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:42.130> second

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
okay so I always finish with a second

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.170 
okay so I always finish with a second
coat<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.580> gel<00:04:44.350> when<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.380> seal<00:04:45.770> my<00:04:46.010> fibers<00:04:46.640> on<00:04:46.850> it

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
coat of gel when I seal my fibers on it

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.160 
coat of gel when I seal my fibers on it
just<00:04:47.750> adds<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:48.380> lot<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.400> impact<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.960> lashes

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
just adds a lot of impact to the lashes

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.290 
just adds a lot of impact to the lashes
so<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:52.220> let<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.430> set<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> second<00:04:53.030> before<00:04:53.150> I

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
so I just let it set a second before I

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.560 
so I just let it set a second before I
put<00:04:53.540> that<00:04:53.630> final<00:04:53.870> coat<00:04:54.110> just<00:04:54.350> on<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.650> tips

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
put that final coat just on the tips

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.610 
put that final coat just on the tips
okay<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:58.130> go<00:04:58.250> back<00:04:58.540> front<00:05:01.000> backs<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.720> why<00:05:03.590> I

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
okay so go back front backs and why I
