pressure<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.700> created<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.269> putting<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
pressure is created I'm putting the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.709 
pressure is created I'm putting the
potato<00:00:10.290> into<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> lot<00:00:10.860> easier<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.719> stick
