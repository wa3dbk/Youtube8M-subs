instead of cleaning them by hand because

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.940 
instead of cleaning them by hand because

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
they will never get clean because they

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.080 
they will never get clean because they

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
first time I just leave them in there

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.729 
first time I just leave them in there
because<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.790> thing<00:03:14.969> about<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:16.139> dishwasher

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
because the thing about the dishwasher

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.830 
because the thing about the dishwasher
is<00:03:16.859> I'm<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.370> only<00:03:17.400> person<00:03:17.579> who<00:03:17.999> ever<00:03:18.030> sees<00:03:18.599> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
is I'm the only person who ever sees the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.660 
is I'm the only person who ever sees the
inside<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.409> because<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.249> don't<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.549> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
inside of it because if I don't do the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.599 
inside of it because if I don't do the
dishes<00:03:20.849> they<00:03:21.060> will<00:03:21.329> not<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.689> done<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.219> can
