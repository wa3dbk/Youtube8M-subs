00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
couple years ago and i started doing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.809 
couple years ago and i started doing
like<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.599> core<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.380> i<00:02:07.470> really<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.310> it's

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
like my core and i really really it's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.050 
like my core and i really really it's
all<00:02:09.000> based<00:02:09.299> around<00:02:10.099> achieving<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.579> strongest

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
all based around achieving the strongest

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.839 
all based around achieving the strongest
core<00:02:12.329> possible<00:02:12.959> both<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> strength<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.579> for

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
core possible both for a strength in for

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.420 
core possible both for a strength in for
stabilization<00:02:15.329> and<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.200> from<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.590> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
stabilization and then from there it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.100 
stabilization and then from there it
strengthens<00:02:17.970> everything<00:02:18.360> else<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> then

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
strengthens everything else and then

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.130 
strengthens everything else and then
daily<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.250> shoulder<00:02:21.060> therapy<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.930> I
