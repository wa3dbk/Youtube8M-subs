00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
well the thing is we're using Rock bolts

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.590 
well the thing is we're using Rock bolts
all<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.290> time<00:00:39.530> yeah<00:00:39.980> resin<00:00:40.640> rock<00:00:40.820> vault<00:00:41.000> yeah

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
all the time yeah resin rock vault yeah

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.070 
all the time yeah resin rock vault yeah
so<00:00:42.140> we're<00:00:42.980> actually<00:00:43.160> moving<00:00:43.580> take<00:00:44.390> 100<00:00:44.930> two

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
so we're actually moving take 100 two

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.640 
so we're actually moving take 100 two
lumps<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> ground<00:00:47.260> inside<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:48.470> mountain

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
lumps on the ground inside this mountain

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.680 
lumps on the ground inside this mountain
now<00:00:48.980> right<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.790> we<00:00:49.850> use<00:00:50.000> an<00:00:50.120> explorer's<00:00:50.480> hips

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
now right and we use an explorer's hips

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.270 
now right and we use an explorer's hips
and<00:00:50.870> all<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.989> rest<00:00:51.110> of<00:00:51.260> it<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:51.949> normal

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
comes right across to this this is where

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.870 
comes right across to this this is where
you'll<00:01:08.360> start<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.080> new<00:01:09.979> via<00:01:10.220> ferrata<00:01:10.430> down

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
you'll start the new via ferrata down

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.850 
you'll start the new via ferrata down
there<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.210> sunlight<00:01:11.649> you'll<00:01:12.649> come<00:01:12.830> up

inclined plane in which they brought the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.910 
inclined plane in which they brought the
slate<00:01:18.530> down<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.850> come<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:21.440> this<00:01:21.560> part

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
slate down you come up to this part

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.100

just see grey and Marc scrambling up
there<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:18.610> really<00:02:18.910> quite<00:02:19.030> steep<00:02:27.480> it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
there that's really quite steep it's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.670 
there that's really quite steep it's
fantastically<00:02:29.230> exposed<00:02:31.110> although<00:02:32.110> once

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
fantastically exposed although once

it's<00:04:33.120> where<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.360> miners<00:04:33.690> actually<00:04:34.020> came<00:04:34.199> up

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
it's where the miners actually came up
