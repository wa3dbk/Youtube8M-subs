00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to use it for structure just when I'm

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.550 
to use it for structure just when I'm
removing<00:00:17.340> these<00:00:17.670> windows<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.080> hold

removing these windows right now to hold
everything<00:00:19.859> together<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:21.449> don't<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.840> any

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
everything together so we don't have any

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.000 
everything together so we don't have any
flexing<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.699> these<00:00:24.000> windows<00:00:24.710> during<00:00:25.710> their

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
flexing on these windows during their

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.550 
flexing on these windows during their
removal<00:00:26.840> we<00:00:27.840> don't<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> risk<00:00:28.320> breaking

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
removal we don't want to risk breaking

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.030 
removal we don't want to risk breaking
them<00:00:29.449> you<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.019> glass<00:00:31.470> cut<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
them you know we can get glass cut the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.560 
them you know we can get glass cut the
same<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:33.059> always<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> greatest

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
same but it's not always the greatest

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
same but it's not always the greatest
out<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.630> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.260> its<00:00:37.530> might<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
out there so if you can see its might be

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
out there so if you can see its might be
a<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.489> hard<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> lighting

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a little hard to see from the lighting

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
a little hard to see from the lighting
but<00:00:40.469> there's<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.280> screws<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:43.320> side<00:00:43.620> here

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
but there's two screws on the side here

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.170 
but there's two screws on the side here
that<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> remove<00:00:45.500> two<00:00:46.940> on<00:00:47.940> each<00:00:48.149> side

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that we need to remove two on each side

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 
that we need to remove two on each side
of<00:00:48.660> each<00:00:48.809> window<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.860> those<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.640> I'm

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of each window to get those out so I'm

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.830 
of each window to get those out so I'm
using<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> larger<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> two<00:00:52.680> screwdrivers<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
using the larger of two screwdrivers and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
using the larger of two screwdrivers and
sometimes<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.960> use<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> smaller<00:00:55.649> skinnier<00:00:56.219> one

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
sometimes I use the smaller skinnier one

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
sometimes I use the smaller skinnier one
on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.449> slower<00:00:58.100> screw<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> not

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
on the slower screw here so is not

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.039 
on the slower screw here so is not
tomorrow<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> face<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:03.449> aluminum

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
tomorrow up the face of that aluminum

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.890 
tomorrow up the face of that aluminum
there<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.680> plan<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> remove<00:01:06.270> both<00:01:06.869> screws

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
there so plan is to remove both screws

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
there so plan is to remove both screws
on<00:01:07.530> either<00:01:07.710> side<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> each<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> these

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
on either side of each one of these

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.070 
on either side of each one of these
windows<00:01:10.070> take<00:01:11.070> them<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.270> also<00:01:12.600> mark

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
windows take them out and I also mark

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.640 
windows take them out and I also mark
which<00:01:13.890> window<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.090> top<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.110> middle<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
which window is the top the middle and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
which window is the top the middle and
the<00:01:17.220> last<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.119> put<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the last because I put them back in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.980 
the last because I put them back in the
same<00:01:19.080> fashion<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.710> well<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.909> another<00:01:21.479> thing

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
same fashion as well and another thing

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
same fashion as well and another thing
to<00:01:22.170> remember<00:01:22.580> when<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.820> disassembling

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to remember when we're disassembling

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.289 
to remember when we're disassembling
these<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.799> track<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.759> screws

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
these is to keep track of these screws

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.440 
these is to keep track of these screws
I've<00:01:27.630> noticed<00:01:28.380> from<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.310> first<00:01:29.759> window<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
I've noticed from my first window that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
I've noticed from my first window that
I've<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.110> sometimes<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.340> outer

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I've done that sometimes this outer

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.530 
I've done that sometimes this outer
screw<00:01:33.259> has<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> pointy<00:01:35.130> type<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> head<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
screw has a pointy type of a head on it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
screw has a pointy type of a head on it
and<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> inner<00:01:37.380> screw<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.040> dead<00:01:38.790> type<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and the inner screw a dead type of a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.639 
and the inner screw a dead type of a
head<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.360> depends<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.350> here

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
head it just depends on this one here

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
head it just depends on this one here
let's<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.790> take<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.110> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
let's just take one out and see what we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
let's just take one out and see what we
we<00:01:46.979> come<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.689> I<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.670> screw<00:01:51.060> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
we come up with I know that the screw on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.310 
we come up with I know that the screw on
the<00:01:51.540> lip<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.530> head<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:53.180> usually<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the lip of the head there usually is a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.370 
the lip of the head there usually is a
flat<00:01:55.829> type<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.340> head<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.049> look<00:01:58.170> at

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
flat type of head so if we could look at

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.330 
flat type of head so if we could look at
that<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> hard<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> zoom<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that kind of hard to zoom in but that is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.020 
that kind of hard to zoom in but that is
a<00:02:02.369> flat<00:02:02.850> head<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> make

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a flat head and we just want to make

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.789 
a flat head and we just want to make
sure<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.630> keep<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> same

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
sure that we keep them in the same

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
sure that we keep them in the same
direction<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:08.879> screwing<00:02:09.420> this

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
direction because when screwing this

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.130 
direction because when screwing this
window<00:02:09.959> back<00:02:10.170> together

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
window back together

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.950 
window back together
she<00:02:11.320> used<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.710> wrong<00:02:11.860> screw<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:13.180> will<00:02:13.510> crack

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
she used the wrong screw you will crack
