00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.140
 Well I'm the archeologist Jon Montgomery 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.420
 smith marquez I am the director of the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.869
 archaeological project with water from 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.189
 colegio de michoacán and the cgt de cultura 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.390
 we are right now in the archaeological site 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.870
 for has been like 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 which is in the n in the municipality 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.130
 of etzatlán 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.140
 formally the archaeological project with 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.180
 water started in 2007 in 2007 2008 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 where the first phase was to do the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 surface tours to do the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 polygonal protection in 2009 and 2011 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.890
 and 2012 we have made excavations the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.629
 we have already found several 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.870
 buildings we have found the phases 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.840
 constructive we also arrived 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.540
 restored as the more or less the 45 by 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.159
 hundred percent of the north structure of the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.810
 palace like 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.729
 Well now we have more 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 questions that easements we know more or 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.750
 less up to where do we know that 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.640
 he was in the valley of atemajac we know 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 who was here we know there are 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.790
 materials in the sayula 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.390
 now we know that they were some societies 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 complex we also know that no 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 we had the villagers nothing but 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.510
 that we had little houses that cities in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.030
 these in these in these places now 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.650
 here in the palace of ocomo we have a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.200
 of the most monumental structures of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:54.570
 its kind in all Mesoamerica the site the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.750
 let's say the polygonal protection are 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.250
 approximately 50 hectares however 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.710
 the site must have been much more 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.680
 big 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.650
 It is a tradition as extensive as the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.920
 Teuchitlan tradition but the interesting thing 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.370
 is the change that existed not between one and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.730
 other 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.920
 it seems that everything was different 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 structures 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.190
 the tectonic structures the tombs 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.290
 the ways of burying the ceramics 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.060
 everything changed 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.219
 well here we are on the facade 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 main structure of the north 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.359
 palace as they are roughly 130 meters 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.060
 135 meters in length what has the 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.769
 structure in this very monumental subject 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.050
 as I was telling you one of the biggest 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.940
 mesoamerica 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.380
 in the restoration it might seem that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.030
 are 33 structures or three steps but 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.180
 they are not really three stages 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.720
 constructive being this the newest 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.060
 so to speak and is this is a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.280
 remodeling and that's the oldest one in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.130
 all stages 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 the sunken patio we can see here is 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.000
 this part is circumscribed by three 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.209
 structures the structure this is the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.520
 that we have here in front of the structure 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.290
 west that is what we have here right now 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.110
 we are on the southern structure 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.450
 the patio must have functioned as a 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.980
 much more private area for 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.019
 owners of the building or for those who 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.560
 they inhabited this building this takes you to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.329
 think what good was in first they had 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120
 a government or they had an elite that 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.189
 He ruled this social structure and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.140
 this building is the representation 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.450
 let's say of the power that could have arrived 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.959
 until the icon we have the sunken patio 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.970
 measures approximately 75 square meters 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.680
 and we do not know what we're going to find there 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.040
 below what we are going to do this year is 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.250
 dig the structure or is the structure 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.709
 this is the one that surely is a little 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.030
 more damaged but good and to the studies of 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.480
 topography that we have done we have 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.760
 realized that it's salvageable and we're going 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.700
 to good to remove all structures 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.659
 modern we are going to clean the building and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.850
 then we will do the research 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.459
 about him 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.290
 we hope to find good we know 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.590
 us that there is an access in the 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.810
 west part of the structure we know that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.650
 is part of the sunken courtyard and we know that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.930
 it is after the north structure this 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.600
 will give us an idea of 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.530
 as it was let's say how was the expansion 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.270
 of the building and what was the ultimate use 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.199
 that had not what were his last 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.199
 its latest functions
