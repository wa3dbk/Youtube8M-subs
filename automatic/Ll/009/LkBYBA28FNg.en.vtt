00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 it's still impressive that two double basses are in French 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.230
 extremely rare instrument one is beyond divergences next to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.020
 Dominican 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.910
 in the west country 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.380
 it is a my workshop of restoration of the wind instrument pierre malterre 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.440
 little explanation on this rare instrument those contrabassoon are not there 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.189
 a lot 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.640
 it is an instrument that is 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 the pre-report what can be used in orchestras and that's really the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.689
 second half of the 19th century generalized the bassist in 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.269
 the big symphonic formations 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.930
 and today it is an instrument that we finally see less because the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.800
 composers write back to numbers them often more restricted 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.470
 bekele dekel instruments tends to fear is that this counter-top 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.810
 she is from which of khaled mechaal it is one of the last models 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.970
 manufactured daily 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.020
 a crampon buffet 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.960
 at the beginning of the games 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.540
 the late 80s early 90s to know that stone was the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.830
 his at the beginning of the summer in the key region 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.579
 you came here to help students to 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.789
 recover 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.970
 this bass to the French this instrument bah the instrument is rare the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.450
 and team specialized in questions are rare at home I had 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.400
 a very good hour 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.430
 a very good experience take over the fact that both camps on leave 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.860
 done refurbish fights are well two stakes set on google us 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.000
 know we are quite 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.630
 proof I know very well backstage since% 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.229
 for quite a few years we have made our debut by concentrating the wind 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.340
 seems 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.830
 and for sanchez had still managed the instrument day and a follow-up 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.090
 for 100 th particular dupe I know that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.370
 first that the job will do it conscientiously and a few 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 players or three setbacks 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.310
 laurent gilles 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.180
 an instrument factor 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.350
 shortly before 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.939
 remains very rare to have orders as it is rare to work 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.280
 on this type of instrument it is an instrument actually we will see 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 very little in Alsace because he is very afraid that his madness that 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.220
 so their share the professional cashes but I know it's very 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 delicate so sincerely we will not see every day so what 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.159
 you had to do to restore it to the very new air islands 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.170
 she is gorgeous which is very entertaining in these instruments know he 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 love 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.350
 gone a little bit like the copper the chatelet chatting punch to 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.489
 all jar circulation is a discovery 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.059
 because we do it for a tax an instrumentalist 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.829
 and we will do it with him that is to say that all income today for 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:18.529
 men 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.079
 to make the settings in fact a little late to hunt the settings so this 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.129
 that we did a little bit this morning or stone how they love each other without 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.959
 French counterfeit 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.859
 very well believe it 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.860
 I really think day and night compared to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.230
 for this instrument two months ago, we are looking forward to seeing all 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.030
 everything that is an agreement 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.909
 in all that is for a technical problem so years 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.980
 gold solved all the little leakage problems because well we are in the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.209
 time for airbus do not end up yet postpone their tightness you 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.880
 arrive in 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.839
 or you arrive in the graf with an hour 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.759
 the lunetier who clog badly 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.129
 it poses problems of emission that posed problem of homogeneity of its 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.740
 it poses problems of attac simply times 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.749
 euros for all you for that you 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.709
 but I've seen you have to blow extremely hard in his coat and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.709
 his son nathan 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.239
 the prince is the most serious note 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.390
 of the instrument 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.429
 happy you have to blow 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.729
 for empire it is necessary to fill all the happy for the volume of the instrument 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.069
 thanks Mr 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.909
 the euro still had a rumor of press that five meters 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.909
 of two pipes month it is necessary to put all in vibration 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.189
 it's sure you're advocating a mason it's half of 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.189
 more than half of the tube you take at least on 100 th 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.979
 it's almost ridiculous next to 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.219
 a length of the david bogie air column these are 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.260
 restoration also frequent him 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.160
 their ardent in the incident 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.059
 one of a wind instruments factor 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.689
 a counterpoison is very rare 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.239
 while I think 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.170
 in all my career I'll already be happy to have made a move that happens 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.200
 and it's also instruments that are in budgets 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.920
 only huge today a contrabassoon savor a little bit 35 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.959
 miles to 40 million South Korea and the length of the restoration where you 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.589
 have passed litigation 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:09.710
 it was done on the three weeks by small by small bits 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.109
 I make a copper part on his instruments 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.220
 4 and then I had a lot of preparation work on the mechanics of 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.630
 part of the assembly 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.430
 which ultimately is not the most complicated and difficult work in 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.259
 upstream is well done 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.289
 this is the work that is here at the ophite fictitious league this is a 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.220
 instrument 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.370
 percent having an agenda here it's healthy cj soly cisse soil so there you have 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.620
 actually a key tool of boutros 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.730
 approximately 18 140 which is being restored so there 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.070
 you have in hand the big branch for who still has a small branch a 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.139
 breech to a beautiful Calais and after an encryption system for the success of 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:44.800
 trials 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.590
 she was seen yesterday just behind the Dominicans 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.460

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.229
 thank you stone for this little piece bravo and gilles to receive 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.990
