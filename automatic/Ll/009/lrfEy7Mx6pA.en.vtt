00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
called a loop station pedal it's got two

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
called a loop station pedal it's got two
different<00:00:39.510> pedals<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.190> play<00:00:41.460> your

can put all these little lines together

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
can put all these little lines together
with<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.190> Loop<00:00:59.340> Station<00:00:59.610> and<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.480> those

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
with your Loop Station and all those

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
strong line alright so here we go so the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
strong line alright so here we go so the
very<00:01:06.270> first<00:01:06.479> line<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.979> key

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

style on bass 7th fret on the a-string
I'm<00:01:32.759> starting<00:01:33.179> here<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.599> it's<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.929> of

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
I'm starting here because it's kind of

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.690 
I'm starting here because it's kind of
middle<00:01:34.349> point<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.830> it'll<00:01:35.039> give<00:01:35.190> me<00:01:35.280> some<00:01:35.459> room

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
middle point so it'll give me some room

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.940 
middle point so it'll give me some room
to<00:01:35.910> go<00:01:36.060> deeper<00:01:36.599> below<00:01:37.050> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.349> next<00:01:37.590> loop<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to go deeper below on the next loop or I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.919 
to go deeper below on the next loop or I
can<00:01:38.069> go<00:01:38.190> higher<00:01:38.459> or<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.819> as<00:01:39.000> well<00:01:39.209> so<00:01:39.780> I'm

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
can go higher or two as well so I'm

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:40.999 
can go higher or two as well so I'm
going<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.080> do<00:01:40.170> something<00:01:40.349> real<00:01:40.560> simple<00:01:40.860> like
