of the tunnel for domination mode i was
thinking<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> game<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.960> would<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.230> up

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
thinking in this game you would go up

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
thinking in this game you would go up
against<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.890> gold<00:00:29.310> legends<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:30.119> something<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
against all gold legends or something of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
against all gold legends or something of
that<00:00:30.660> nature<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.500> instead<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.850> guys<00:00:32.969> can

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that nature but instead as you guys can

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
that nature but instead as you guys can
see<00:00:33.210> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.260> against<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.649> super<00:00:35.190> team

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
see we're going up against a super team

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.340 
see we're going up against a super team
this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.450> basically<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.129> 2012<00:00:38.129> Olympic<00:00:38.610> team

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
this is basically the 2012 Olympic team

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
this is basically the 2012 Olympic team
that<00:00:40.350> should<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.710> been<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:41.160> injuries

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that should have been if injuries

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.310 
that should have been if injuries
weren't<00:00:42.059> occurred<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.140> pretty

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
weren't occurred so I was pretty

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
weren't occurred so I was pretty
surprised<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.920> wasn't<00:00:44.040> something<00:00:44.309> else

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
surprised there wasn't something else

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.049 
surprised there wasn't something else

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
have to win the game to unlock the 3

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
have to win the game to unlock the 3
stars<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> started<00:01:27.060> winning<00:01:27.270> games

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
stars and when I started winning games

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
stars and when I started winning games
in<00:01:27.810> domination<00:01:28.259> mode<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.680> was<00:01:28.860> still<00:01:29.040> getting

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
in domination mode I was still getting

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280

one<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:29.820> stars<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> thought<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> myself

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one or two stars so I thought to myself

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
one or two stars so I thought to myself
what<00:01:31.799> am<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.340> wrong<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.820> had<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> doing

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
star game against the Clippers and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
star game against the Clippers and
that's<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.130> Chris<00:01:38.579> Paul<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.180> midget<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
shooting percentage but 2k made this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.210 
shooting percentage but 2k made this
game-mode<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.780> too<00:01:51.840> difficult<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:53.040> these

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
game-mode way too difficult to get these

last<00:01:53.549> three<00:01:53.970> star<00:01:54.210> packs<00:01:54.570> it'd<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.470> nice<00:01:55.649> if

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
last three star packs it'd be nice if

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
last three star packs it'd be nice if
you<00:01:56.100> make<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> time<00:01:56.640> longer<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> quarters

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you make the time longer in the quarters

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
you make the time longer in the quarters
so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.280> time<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.700> score

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
so you can have more time to score

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
instead of opening two packs I open up

instead of opening two packs I open up
one<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.510> pack<00:03:27.780> isn't<00:03:28.079> much<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
one and that one pack isn't much the
