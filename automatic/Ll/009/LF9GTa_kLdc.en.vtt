specific<00:01:34.710> ship<00:01:35.189> today<00:01:35.369> we're<00:01:35.700> using<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
specific ship today we're using the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.969 
specific ship today we're using the
salaah<00:01:37.049> tea<00:01:37.850> Organic<00:01:38.850> white<00:01:39.030> sugar<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
salaah tea Organic white sugar and you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
because you can eat that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.870 
because you can eat that
oh<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.369> edible<00:01:56.640> yeah<00:01:57.030> collateral<00:01:57.539> damage

oh is it edible yeah collateral damage
okay<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.240> got<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.420> water<00:02:00.810> we're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
okay and then we got some water we're

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.020 
okay and then we got some water we're
gonna<00:02:01.380> add<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.840> important<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
gonna add and it's important to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
gonna add and it's important to
obviously<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.420> monitor<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> heat<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
obviously just monitor the heat you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.460 
obviously just monitor the heat you
first<00:02:07.590> want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> dissolve<00:02:08.420> sugar<00:02:09.420> yes<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
first want to dissolve sugar yes and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.620 
first want to dissolve sugar yes and
then<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.819> give<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> stir<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.540> me

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
then so you can give that a stir for me

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.199 
then so you can give that a stir for me
I<00:02:12.900> will<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.500> while<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.769> enjoy<00:02:14.069> life<00:02:14.280> it's

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I will do that while I enjoy life it's

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.059 
I will do that while I enjoy life it's
an<00:02:15.300> equal<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.690> cotton<00:02:16.019> candy<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.530> candy<00:02:16.860> floss

an equal in cotton candy or candy floss

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.680 
an equal in cotton candy or candy floss
because<00:02:17.280> people<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.000> many<00:02:18.180> things<00:02:18.480> call

because people have so many things call
a<00:02:18.720> cotton<00:02:19.140> candy<00:02:19.459> yeah<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:21.030> call<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.299> candy

a cotton candy yeah and we call it candy
floss<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.870> huh<00:02:21.959> yeah<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:23.040> our<00:02:23.190> guns<00:02:23.519> school

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
floss at huh yeah in our guns school

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.860

awesome

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
awesome

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.839 
awesome
I've<00:02:25.019> got<00:02:25.290> three<00:02:25.680> pots<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.069> sugar<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.580> going

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
I've got three pots of sugar here going

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.589 
I've got three pots of sugar here going
on<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.310> okay<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.760> key<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.269> to

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
on here so okay so the key here is to

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.259 
on here so okay so the key here is to
stir<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.080> until<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.530> sugar<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.890> dissolved

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
stir it until the sugar is dissolved

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.449 
stir it until the sugar is dissolved
well<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:33.569> happening<00:02:33.720> quite<00:02:34.049> yet<00:02:34.230> so

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
well it's not happening quite yet so

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.410 
well it's not happening quite yet so
because<00:02:35.459> often<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:35.880> happens<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.390> people

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
because often what happens is people

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.900 
because often what happens is people
start<00:02:36.720> boiling<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.380> sugar<00:02:37.500> before<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.670> sugar

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
start boiling the sugar before the sugar

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.100 
start boiling the sugar before the sugar
crystals<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.360> dissolved<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:39.900> then<00:02:39.989> what

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
crystals have dissolved and then what

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.710 
crystals have dissolved and then what
happens<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:41.010> when<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.489> crystals<00:02:41.849> are<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.599> if

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
happens is when the crystals are so if

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
happens is when the crystals are so if
you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.110> imagine<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.500> pot<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.799> boiling<00:02:43.950> with

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
you can imagine a pot of boiling with

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
you can imagine a pot of boiling with
the<00:02:44.910> sugar<00:02:45.150> crystals<00:02:45.299> they<00:02:45.599> bump<00:02:45.810> into<00:02:45.989> each

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the sugar crystals they bump into each

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.440 
the sugar crystals they bump into each
other<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.040> they<00:02:47.250> attach<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.579> each<00:02:47.819> other<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
other and they attach to each other and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
other and they attach to each other and
then<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.720> creates<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> solid<00:02:49.590> mess<00:02:49.799> this

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
then it creates like a solid mess this

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.490 
then it creates like a solid mess this
is<00:02:51.680> scientific<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.079> what<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.380> do

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
is scientific and then what we do

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.140 
is scientific and then what we do
usually<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.370> when<00:02:56.940> we're<00:02:57.060> making

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
usually with with when we're making

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.780 
usually with with when we're making
sugar<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.620> brush<00:02:58.890> down<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.280> size<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.670> your

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
sugar is you brush down the size of your

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.940 
sugar is you brush down the size of your
pot<00:02:59.940> just<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.239> make<00:03:00.450> sure<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.989> crystal

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
pot just to make sure that the crystal

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.490 
pot just to make sure that the crystal
as<00:03:02.100> I've<00:03:02.220> gone<00:03:02.340> alright<00:03:03.170> okay<00:03:04.170> clearly<00:03:04.380> you

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
as I've gone alright okay clearly you

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.809 
as I've gone alright okay clearly you
can<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:04.799> why<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.130> dangerous

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
can see why this is dangerous

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.640 
can see why this is dangerous
yeah<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.359> need<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.870> careful<00:03:07.019> it's<00:03:07.500> not

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
yeah you need to be careful it's not

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.050 
yeah you need to be careful it's not
something<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.340> kids<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.730> really<00:03:11.060> yeah

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
something that the kids can really yeah

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.390 
something that the kids can really yeah
okay<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:12.930> we're<00:03:13.620> looking<00:03:13.739> at<00:03:14.040> there<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:14.310> go

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
okay so we're looking at there we go

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.090 
okay so we're looking at there we go
that's<00:03:14.609> that's<00:03:15.000> dissolved<00:03:15.420> now<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.380> now<00:03:16.530> you

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that's that's dissolved now so now you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.430 
that's that's dissolved now so now you
can<00:03:17.310> add<00:03:17.549> glucose<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.299> as<00:03:18.540> well<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
can add glucose to this as well the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.270 
can add glucose to this as well the
glucose<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.100> will<00:03:20.790> stop<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.239> from

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
glucose just will stop it from from

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.590 
glucose just will stop it from from
caramelizing<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.400> sorry<00:03:23.850> crystallizing<00:03:24.480> as

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
caramelizing and sorry crystallizing as

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.870 
caramelizing and sorry crystallizing as
well<00:03:24.870> yeah<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.920> then<00:03:26.130> now<00:03:26.370> you're<00:03:26.579> going<00:03:26.760> to

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
well yeah and then now you're going to
