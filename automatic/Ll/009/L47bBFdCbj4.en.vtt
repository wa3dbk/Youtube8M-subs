00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 state-of-the-art equipment gives more 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 agility to the fairy 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.590
 Brazilian air force for the country 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.070
 the robot should reduce from four months to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.170
 only two weeks the separation time 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 delivery of goods 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 the current air force 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.730
 Brazilian population has approximately 70 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.189
 thousand military of which 50 thousand buy 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.179
 the uniforms themselves the total of items 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.149
 reaches 1,074 we get the tissues 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.160
 mainly we test the tissue 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.630
 to ensure that the race to the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.980
 quality of the material then we 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.350
 we deliver the fabrics with the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.260
 suppliers and manufactures the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 products back to us we do 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 again with battery of exams 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 quality tests 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 after that store our state 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.360
 central and move away from the time 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.420
 separation of the material for the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.370
 roses on top take up to four months only 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 that the newly implanted equipment 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 promises to reduce this time to two 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.159
 weeks 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 the robotic device on rails 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.590
 obey commands to access the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 and take them to the withdrawal area of ​​the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.560
 goods 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 Automation aims to meet growing 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 demand for uniforms 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 last year they were marketed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.979
 more than 220 thousand items between bales of 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.140
 accessories 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.820
 this project is part of the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.829
 aeronautical strategic planning is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.979
 a philosophy of our command of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.650
 rationalization of expenditure as 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.020
 also rationalization of personnel, I think 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.939
 around 530 cubic meters 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.549
 storage in payments bagged 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.610
 today with the same area we are with the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.950
 around 1,260 cubic meters 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.140
 The new system controls entry and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.229
 material output became more rigid 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 all products take beyond the code 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.890
 of bars 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.500
 this radio identification tag 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 often through this mechanism the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 system can do a quick 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.610
 reading all the items that are 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 inside the box to check how many 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.860
 are being withdrawn and how many are 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.900
 being returned to the stoke any 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.450
 Divergence 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.340
 is charged on the monitor and the operation 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.129
 can be finalized 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.189
 the system only concludes the operation after 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.439
 this check according to the aeronautical 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.200
 state-of-the-art technology aims to 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.150
 safety in the distribution of material and 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.359
 manages to supply the stores in the most 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.099
 fast and does not happen to the customer 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.879
 appear in the store in a product 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.519
 available 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.920
 The trick is to avoid this situation. 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.689
 situation so that every month will be 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.230
 sent a supply for all flights 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.230
 from now
