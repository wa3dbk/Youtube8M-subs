00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.980
 well now let's see this type of plane 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.230
 with the tip in this way on and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.540
 let's see from below and see how 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.510
 realize this we start from ours 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.820
 usually a4 paper sheet and lo 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.060
 let's explain half way down then 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
 let's take the point let's coincide 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 who are starting to explain a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.270
 half the serious lines always more steps 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 sometimes maybe with July here we have the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 soft but supportive surface 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.500
 Hard on the nail is always then to this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.399
 point let's take the center here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 let's go here and always draw the line 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.570
 from the inside to the outside in a manner 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.270
 such that no bubbles are created 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.579
 unlock from the inside out 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 we trace the line we arrived at 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.339
 this point now this side will go on 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.810
 center so we live like this 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:11.540
 watch out for the train tip but that's where 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 from the inside to the outside others from 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 rich are the same thing too 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.080
 on the other hand, something that needs to be done 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.930
 put to tennis and of course it's the tip 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.659
 once the tip is done we match everything 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.830
 how much we hold from the inside towards 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.360
 the outside and we have done this now 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.700
 we get over half well 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.610
 and let's go down so we bend to be 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.280
 sure to bend to the center we turn one 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.680
 time let's see how we can do 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.530
 engrave the center center we come this 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.210
 point and then we folded the stereo 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.050
 3 less at this point a little more than the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.940
 half 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.410
 now we have here and we pull up we do the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.570
 same thing also from this side to 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.740
 made to do it cleanly 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.229
 ok effect on the center we have made to 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.229
 this point we will fold back in half 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.149
 this side will go to the center 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 let's start from the tip we notice 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.950
 something that gradually and we pray the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.580
 beak is closing 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.320
 the wing is closing that hand 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.220
 we explain when we get to this 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.670
 point 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.670
 we enlarge 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.159
 we get this fold here 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 let's see again on the other side as if it will be 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.659
 even more clear we are going to bend 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.349
 let's start with the beak that the most part 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.670
 difficult that we go hand jeans but 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.329
 human we ask is as we bend 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.239
 we look forward to closing it 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:56.040
 ok when the house a little closed we will be 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:00.810
 already ready to reopen it giving shape to the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.830
 our plane so specular to the malt that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.180
 we are in the same place 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.829
 very well 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 we press all the more solidity we turn 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.709
 on the other side it is called less in the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.050
 roster really taking shape 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.530
 let's say everything coincide 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.020
 at this point let's click the wing 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.470
 following this line see this line 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.480
 we lean on it so that 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.800
 we follow the exact same line e 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.330
 let's go up we follow the same 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.860
 line 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.120
 we conclude also the other one 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.120
 wing as a reference point so 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 press 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.680
 this is so we can want to unlock 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.360
 here as badges or not 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.510
 we can come go directly to 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.590
 I launch this very fast mario 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.810
 and very original build your the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 your toy with a simple sheet of 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 a4 card
