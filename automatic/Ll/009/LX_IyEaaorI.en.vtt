00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.920
 My name is Esther Malangu. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 And I'm from Emtambotini. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960
 My grandmother and my mother taught me to paint. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.160
 I kept painting the walls of our house 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 even when they went out for a break. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 When they came in, they told me: 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 "What have you done, child? Never again!" 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 Then, I started painting on the back of our house. 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.320
 Gradually, my drawings were getting better and better. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.480
 until they finally told me 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 to continue painting on the facade of the house. 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 Then I realized I was good at painting. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 There is a very well-established theme 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 in the art of my people. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960
 The paintings, the houses, the vases 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.960
 even the blankets come out equally. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.360
 We have traditionally used five different types of soil to make the paint. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.080
 The colors we had were red, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.480
 black, orange, and blue. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.400
 Then we added fertilizer to thicken the dye. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.240
 But today we have so many bright color paints. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.240
 I was very proud of my work, 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.760
 because I wanted to keep my culture for the children. 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.200
 The most important thing is the work to "catch your eye". 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.800
 I've always wanted to create something that looks beautiful. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.800
 When I painted this BMW, 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.000
 I used what was in the heart 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.440
 and my head. 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 The drawing was inspired by the traditional design for my people. 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.800
 Now, people come from all over the world, 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.800
 such as America and France. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.040
 They come to learn how to draw like me. 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.960
 Painting is in my blood. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.080
 Nothing, I will never stop drawing. 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.280
 He will be drawing for the rest of his life.
