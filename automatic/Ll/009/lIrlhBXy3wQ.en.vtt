thing<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.190> want<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.400> do<00:00:51.520> when<00:00:51.910> learning<00:00:52.180> this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
thing you want to do when learning this

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.880 
thing you want to do when learning this
trick<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.780> would<00:00:53.200> first<00:00:53.380> recommend<00:00:53.590> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
trick I would first recommend actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.020 
trick I would first recommend actually
which<00:00:56.880> is<00:00:57.060> like<00:00:57.240> this<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:59.520> helps<00:00:59.850> me<00:01:00.000> out

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
which is like this that helps me out

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.120 
which is like this that helps me out
because<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.480> gets<00:01:00.630> your<00:01:00.780> body<00:01:00.960> position<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
because it gets your body position for a

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.470 
because it gets your body position for a
car<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.610> it's<00:01:02.730> basically<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> same<00:01:03.420> thing

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
car and it's basically the same thing

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
car and it's basically the same thing
I'll<00:01:04.440> turn<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.220> gonna<00:01:05.309> true

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I'll turn it this way so I'm gonna true

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.380 
I'll turn it this way so I'm gonna true

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Atlanta Royale

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
Atlanta Royale
my<00:01:07.260> hips<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.590> pretty<00:01:07.800> much<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.220> area

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
my hips are pretty much in the same area

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.430 
my hips are pretty much in the same area
so<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.480> what<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.690> think<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.260> true

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
so that's what I think about when I true

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.700 
so that's what I think about when I true
crying<00:01:10.710> around<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.160> going<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:12.120> jumping

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm just wearing my hips up to the rail

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.020 
I'm just wearing my hips up to the rail
like<00:01:16.049> so

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
like so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.790 
like so
another<00:01:17.720> thing<00:01:17.870> that<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.050> noticed<00:01:18.080> when<00:01:18.590> doing

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
another thing that I noticed when doing

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.210 
another thing that I noticed when doing
a<00:01:18.860> true-crime<00:01:19.040> grind<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:20.320> pretty<00:01:21.320> much<00:01:21.470> 90%<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
a true-crime grind is pretty much 90% of

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.410 
a true-crime grind is pretty much 90% of
our<00:01:22.310> weight<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.610> going<00:01:22.730> to<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:22.910> on<00:01:23.000> my<00:01:23.150> sole

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
our weight is going to be on my sole

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.380 
our weight is going to be on my sole
foot<00:01:23.660> so<00:01:24.230> when<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.410> do<00:01:24.500> my<00:01:24.620> true<00:01:25.010> and<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.030> land<00:01:26.270> on

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
foot so when I do my true and I land on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.300 
foot so when I do my true and I land on
my<00:01:26.450> sole<00:01:26.690> foot<00:01:26.930> that's<00:01:27.800> what<00:01:27.950> I'm<00:01:28.040> aiming<00:01:28.130> for

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
my sole foot that's what I'm aiming for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.800 
my sole foot that's what I'm aiming for
I'm<00:01:28.729> not<00:01:28.970> really<00:01:29.150> worrying<00:01:29.390> too<00:01:29.630> much<00:01:29.660> about

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'm not really worrying too much about

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
I'm not really worrying too much about
my<00:01:30.110> back<00:01:30.320> foot<00:01:30.650> all<00:01:31.340> my<00:01:31.610> weights<00:01:31.790> go<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:31.970> my

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
my back foot all my weights go to my

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.330 
my back foot all my weights go to my
sole<00:01:32.300> foot<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.050> spin<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:34.100> spend

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
sole foot so as you spin you spend

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
down at the rail to lock that sulphate

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.000 
down at the rail to lock that sulphate
in<00:01:38.060> because<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.330> sole<00:01:38.540> foot<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:39.020> key<00:01:39.440> if<00:01:39.830> you

down<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.400> rail<00:02:29.549> it's<00:02:30.120> dangerous<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.720> you're

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
down the rail it's dangerous if you're

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.420 
down the rail it's dangerous if you're
in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> air<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.010> look<00:02:32.190> over<00:02:32.340> your

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
in the air and you go to look over your

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
in the air and you go to look over your
shoulders<00:02:32.730> we're<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.329> you're<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.780> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
shoulders we're going you're going to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.120 
shoulders we're going you're going to
miss<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.049> trick<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.470> hit<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.799> rail<00:02:34.950> you're

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
miss the trick just hit the rail you're

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.009 
miss the trick just hit the rail you're
going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> flip<00:02:35.519> over<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
going to flip over you really want to

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.150 
going to flip over you really want to
spot<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.530> rail<00:02:37.680> as<00:02:37.829> you're<00:02:37.920> coming<00:02:38.069> down

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
spot the rail as you're coming down

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.030 
spot the rail as you're coming down
that's<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.579> main<00:02:38.730> thing<00:02:38.940> trying<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.299> spot<00:02:39.660> it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
that's the main thing trying to spot it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.440 
that's the main thing trying to spot it
also<00:02:41.040> when<00:02:41.370> learning<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.670> trick<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.209> really

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
also when learning this trick you really

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.360 
also when learning this trick you really
want<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> stall<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.980> go<00:02:44.069> back<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
want to stall this I know we go back to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.130 
want to stall this I know we go back to
the<00:02:44.489> old<00:02:44.640> lessons<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.329> say<00:02:45.480> stalling<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> curbs

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the old lessons we say stalling a curbs

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.870 
the old lessons we say stalling a curbs
on<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> crack<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.220> really<00:02:47.579> want<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> do

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
on the crack but you really want to do

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.860 
on the crack but you really want to do
that<00:02:47.910> before<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.269> do<00:02:48.329> this<00:02:48.450> trick<00:02:48.690> because

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that before you do this trick because

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.730 
that before you do this trick because
you<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.889> commit

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
you really have to commit

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.410 
you really have to commit
so<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.160> find<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.490> find<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.790> crack<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.390> just

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
so just find it find a crack and just

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.490 
so just find it find a crack and just
sit<00:02:53.780> there

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
sit there

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.460 
sit there
jump<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.370> into<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.640> trick<00:02:57.230> takes<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.350> while

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
jump right into that trick takes a while

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.260 
jump right into that trick takes a while
to<00:02:58.500> be<00:02:58.680> used<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.950> Georgie<00:02:59.310> into<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> doing

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
to be used to Georgie into it doing

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.850 
to be used to Georgie into it doing
something<00:03:00.450> small<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.050> then<00:03:01.320> progress<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.770> get

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
something small and then progress to get

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.680 
something small and then progress to get
bigger<00:03:02.070> okay<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.270> breakdown<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
bigger okay so that's the breakdown of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.090 
bigger okay so that's the breakdown of
the<00:03:03.840> true<00:03:03.990> con<00:03:04.200> grind<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.560> hope<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.860> didn't<00:03:05.040> miss

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
the true con grind I hope I didn't miss

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.700 
the true con grind I hope I didn't miss
anything<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.180> did<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.020> know<00:03:07.050> examine<00:03:07.590> how

anything if I did you know examine how
I'm<00:03:07.830> doing<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.130> trick<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.580> if<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.760> see

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
I'm doing the trick and if you see
