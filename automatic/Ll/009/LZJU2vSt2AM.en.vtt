00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:18.139
 ten-cylinder 525 hp 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.139
 the audi r8 5.2 fsi quattro 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 But he brings the power to the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.710
 asphalt engine vision tests the r8 v10 am 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.710
 limit 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.949
 only details indicate that this 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.710
 a r8 with factory power syringe 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.809
 is the tail with taillights is in 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.780
 the exhaust fumes are dipped in black 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.430
 Two big tailpipes blown 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.670
 the players are more distinctive and wider 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.079
 shaped the front air intakes and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.939
 the lip of the front apron are 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.750
 glossy black and have only 

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:01.460
 two more cross strokes 19 inches 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 double spokes all in titanium optics 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.149
 bring the power to the ground 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.590
 Carbon fiber reinforced ceramic brakes 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.840
 offer the power unit but now to 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.170
 essentially the difference to the base 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.539
 r8 makes the 5.2 liter ten cylinder 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.780
 this Ingolstadt produces 525 ps 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.820
 and 530 newton meters 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 Now for the all-important question what 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.740
 the r8 v10 really has it 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.680
 a whole lot, especially one 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.130
 grandiose curve position mid-engine side 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.900
 the r8 5.2 fsi brings with the quattro 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 drive his power well on the 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.640
 street all four tires clawed themselves 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.320
 full throttle in the asphalt driving behavior 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.510
 is impressively neutral 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.090
 the driver receives exact feedback from 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.830
 the street the esp can be there 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.760
 completely shut down as befits 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.680
 a real sports car just heard 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.130
 in 3 9 seconds is already the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.590
 Hundred brand cracked 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.630
 At 316 kilometers per hour is the end 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.630
 no wishes remain elevated 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.280
 not like the petrol station tenant 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.010
 on our race track use 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.340
 every 100 kilometers 41 liters through the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.340
 ten cylinders 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.840
 but who first the 144 1400 euro 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.969
 basic price for the r8 5.2 fsi quattro 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.170
 it can be known deeply about it 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.170
 Certainly not scare any more
