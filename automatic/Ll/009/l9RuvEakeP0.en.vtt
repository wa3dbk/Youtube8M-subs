00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.540
 and we come back with our harlequin jelly 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.590
 notice that we already have as we had 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.599
 Initially made our gelatin 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.509
 moradita and verdecita but not yet 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.460
 has this acid itself because we are 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 accustomed with gelatin as 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.170
 solution to that with citric acid 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.630
 we are placing 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.630
 a little bit of citric acid not much 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.590
 because citric acid slows down a lot 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.850
 gelatin set 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.540
 and a lot doing psychic you would have to 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.880
 put many islands 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.950
 Of course, you have to make him feel 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.870
 in simple here in the mouth if it is 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.180
 typical of good gelatin I have my 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.190
 latinas tower of colors I have my 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.210
 white gelatin that will be the support 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.300
 and we have here our packaging for 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.910
 set our gelatins because we have 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.730
 three if I'm going to make a single jelly 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.670
 a small one where I'm going to put a 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.460
 layer of white jelly not very thick 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.650
 true arrival rather new centimeter 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.259
 approximately then I will take it to 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.630
 the fridge and I'm going to let it set and 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.850
 then there I will place the other 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 colored jellies cut in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.070
 squares because I have these two I'm going 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.050
 to place a capita berdeak to a 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.530
 I'm going to let them set 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.320
 and let's chop it ok diced 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.700
 is everything and those little boxes are going to go later 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.299
 on top of our jelly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.299
 here we have 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.120
 here we have our gelatin 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.170
 this has to be taken to the fridge and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.659
 let it curdle 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.600
 robert I put it sorry robert and 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.000
 about these containers which already have 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060
 egg white so that after better 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.979
 my gelatin ok and they have clear 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 egg these also place the clear 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 of egg and the management card when 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.700
 is well dry is when I can 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.149
 use it good I take my jellies 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.890
 to the fridge and I have of course 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.890
 some gelatins here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 Curd 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.880
 with colors 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 and I have some acquaintances prepared by 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.290
 here, not exactly the same 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.870
 and then I have the same thing that we had 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.900
 done before with other colorcito 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.600
 here I have then my three layers of 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.520
 jelly the white one of color and one of 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.720
 eye 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.870
 all my color gelatin 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.820
 to unmold gelatin 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.819
 very important to break the cuticle that 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.690
 shape 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.980
 between the gelatins of the world 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.390
 we put here we spend the finger a little 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.390
 so that air enters 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.440
 and we're going to let her fall 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.480
 she 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.480
 little by little ok 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.750
 meanwhile I come with the other and 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.000
 we repeat the operation break the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.069
 cuticle there 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.890
 between the mold and the gelatin here 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.490
 we place here 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.709
 and unmold it should go falling alone 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.190
 I just let him fall 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.890
 little the air and dropped it 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.760
 in the streets and a lot 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.380
 protocol ok we have here my jelly 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.080
 white our white jelly better 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.630
 said already curd 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.340
 here we are going to add this gelatin as 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.340
 in squares of course 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.160
 we take a pizza cut 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.890
 I do it 2 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.740
 If I want to be very beautiful and elegant 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.460
 also that I have here half if I want 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.460
 try my final 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.440
 but if I'm in a hurry because I'm 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.160
 doing as 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.830
 and I want to finish as soon as possible 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.300
 because I have ten gelatins ordered 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.300
 I do it this way 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.799
 we fix any problem 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.949
 why 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.949
 everyone has their rule in the house well 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.530
 there 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.390
 with turning so they can see the 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:39.190
 I do it to my forehead 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.639
 of course because known the other way around is 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.439
 as strange 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.990
 but well we already know what things 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:48.270
 television do not make it so uncomfortable 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.370
 do it watching if you of course 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.310
 these are simple things that one already goes 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.910
 learning with time truth and now 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.910
 here 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.300
 and if you are very hurried more quickly 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.340
 that also serve to decorate me 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.139
 that I want to put them out and if what 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.550
 I was going to make such a big jelly 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.660
 I can put many squares in a 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.259
 platÃ³n that the kids will love 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.910
 simply eat gelatin squares 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.889
 and these are what we call the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.880
 little worms just the long strip 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.450
 without finishing chopping 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.450
 here 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.819
 this month squares 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.820
 azulito saw that it is very fast if 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.600
 we do this way 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.600
 I have here 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.009
 let's try forgiveness that we have left 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.500
 cute infinite while smaller 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.060
 keep the squares better you know why 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.850
 it's easier to fill in with the rest 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.689
 of condensed milk and it's nicer 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.339
 the finish on the gelatin there 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.960
 although because he's going to have a lot more of 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.650
 colour 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.650
 we flipped 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.540
 and we finished cutting 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.550
 this is also nice so just a 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.710
 cup with a lot of Latin and there are many 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.080
 negative squares if they are children 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.890
 small children I mean children 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.630
 2 years old 3 years old takes his squares and 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.170
 they are eating them, it seems very 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.170
 funny 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.460
 two 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.460
 we finished cutting 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.360
 and we have then 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.360
 by caritas all our pieces 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.620
 I come with my white jelly but no longer 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.840
 I have more time left for this moment 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.789
 really good then let's go to a cut 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.449
 we are back to finish our 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.449
 rich gelatin
