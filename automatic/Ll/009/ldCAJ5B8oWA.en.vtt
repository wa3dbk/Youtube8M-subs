00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.649
 simons we fight with 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.000
 against pokémons because that's a big one 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:58.390
 war and we are here 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.030
 a strong person and carry the name 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.519
 the name is just fine 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.060
 I can not think of it so we do 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:14.660
 instead of our adventure as a theory who 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:17.090
 handsome young man walking though 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.640
 always know it makes you feel like that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.420
 So you want to do it professionally 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.820
 I heard that vox viewers want 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.970
 do not have many spectators 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.899
 thank you yes that's right 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.890
 yes, right now we want ours 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.869
 start adventure 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.539
 So let it go on soft 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.979
 you on the world nussloch challenger quite 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.680
 important close so you know maybe 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.259
 however, so it's about that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.670
 We have to take care of some things like that 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.360
 can not just play pokémon is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 almost hardcore you around the world in front of breast 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.450
 to take 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.910
 we get pokemon and the data now 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.520
 but then not lose in the fight 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.630
 You have to understand that and and in the process 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.300
 Let's start now 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.110
 pokémon catch go because I know too 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.430
 not because I do not know what else to do 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.080
 after 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.320
 I hope he has nothing up 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.800
 otherwise nothing will happen to us 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.800
 and that god 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:31.260
 So to the pokémon rules and that 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.739
 That's why we should first one 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.420
 choose 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.090
 so no chichi okay we want that 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.519
 Do not he have a bald head? 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 okay, he also has a bald head 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.750
 We'll finger away from there with balding 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.299
 he goes at least ears the good take 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.080
 We here on the mother under the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:58.340
 head okay then you have something there 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.020
 Okay so given up after the spots 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.730
 to judge his body 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.120
 So that's just how I got the name 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 That's okay, I have everything 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.540
 Well written I think 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.230
 biscotte ugliness of course a 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.280
 program called so again the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:21.670
 users slanted compact so expected 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.740
 just again a fight all good 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.420
 So it usually comes as well 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.980
 but now fight when our buffer 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.500
 dies then we have to let it go 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.400
 and then we have it there 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.140
 we lost 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.010
 if we have no pokémon we have yes 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.010
 it may be sufficient and strong again 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.239
 who as a tourist, of course, sums up the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.630
 strategy is we must first 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.810
 Opponents weaken that the most important 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.810
 at all 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.760
 yes exactly thank you professor 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 I know that too 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.150
 ok carinthia 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.770
 fight because that's the key to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.890
 win my friends 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.890
 he says it also my coach had 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.709
 the liaison partner fights 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.069
 esetec is also struggling for an exciting one 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.950
 fight my friends 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.940
 we'll pack that okay okay but 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.430
 do not worry so much will not 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.360
 So windows login snow happens 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.770
 still something good 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.950
 usually comes again a direct hit 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.419
 or we can not lose and so 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.610
 if we lose , it's up to us 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.290
 limited trainer skills for us 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.680
 so that we meet is also in 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.190
 order 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.450
 yes okay okay that's okay that's it 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.450
 then also from the usage challenge 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.970
 stop the eat you
