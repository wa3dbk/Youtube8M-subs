 former magistrate henry villarraga was the 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.530
 Colonel's most frequent interlocutor 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.419
 that were intercepted the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.150
 sections of them are mentioned 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.280
 including one of the negotiators in 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.679
 Silvia Carlos havana cárdenas the 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.810
 magistrate asked the colonel to show him 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.609
 to the generalate the jurisprudence that he 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 I had offered him to tell them 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.900
 that he had achieved what they did not 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.130
 had been in the package 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.410
 recordings containing conversations 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.270
 between army generals with the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.620
 colonel robinson gonzales prisoner in the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.360
 erectus center or military bridge 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.890
 aranda are also the archives 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.350
 revealed last October by 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.789
 news one of dialogues held him 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.170
 with him gonzález with the then 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.109
 magistrate of the council of the judiciary 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.820
 henry villarraga such recordings are 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.050
 legal because they correspond to the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.270
 investigation that advances justice 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.550
 Civil Colonel Gonzales for two 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.190
 alleged extrajudicial executions in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.440
 once casting them to an unpublished one it remains in 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.539
 evidence the relationship of villarraga not 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.629
 only with gonzález but also with high 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.800
 commanders of the military forces of iph 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 definitely it changed her will 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.520
 change on Wednesday the thesis is command 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 So what we have fought from 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.390
 from which they come out hopefully so that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.700
 that in general 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 and pick that up like a flag and you 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 will call montilla to anahuac to all 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.710
 they laughed at all civilian generals 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.780
 I managed to get Luciano have 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.760
 got in another conversation between 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.530
 gonzález and villarraga tried 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.210
 Approach General Jorge Enrique 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.830
 Moor is commander of the forces 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.450
 military and current member of the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.190
 Government delegation in Havana 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 but the high official 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.630
 lunch confirmed 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.310
 then general will suddenly be able to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.899
 all monies are perfect 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.729
 my classmates are ready and brothers 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.360
 and already confirmed in half an hour if 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.360
 that because 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 that the nabai or my companions are 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.430
 a little angry we could meet with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.430
 others all do not know what 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.120
 and also the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.850
 togado favors for uniformed 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.790
 not only for Colonel González 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.950
 granted this woman how to have in 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 mind that those guys are looking for the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.900
 of the transfer but surprisingly the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.550
 Colonel Gonzales' access to the river that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 it is also the center of the scandal of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.050
 corruption in the army and goes beyond 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 of the villarraga magistrate apparently 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.980
 the visited the courthouse 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 being imprisoned steps working 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.690
 bury every two days there are two left 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.040
 days with jacqueline from the same 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.880
 state but and gonzález 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:57.560
 and I know these recordings are in 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.410
 power of a special unit of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.730
 prosecutor the president saints and asked him 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 the minister of defense to take 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.200
 immediate decisive decisions and 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.580
 exemplary by business 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.350
 military with the prisoner colonel 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.330
 reported by the week magazine 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.550
 daniela vargas silva minutes later the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.050
 command of the military forces issued 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.540
 a statement in which his commander 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.240
 sends to apologize to the prosecution and 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.470
 announced the opening of investigations 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.120
 President Juan Manuel Santos 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.350
 described as serious the facts of 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.210
 corruption in hiring the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.070
 army denounced by the magazine 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.140
 week and asked that the investigation be 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.730
 advanced by civil justice so 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.010
 that he asked the prosecution to give him 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 priority I feel outraged by the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.940
 damage that causes the forces 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.710
 military and the saint country assured that 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.480
 the instructions to the defense minister 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.000
 Juan Carlos Pinzón to proceed to 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.350
 apply strong sanctions and the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.720
 inform the country when considering 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.040
 unacceptable the very serious events the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.300
 corruption facts that have been 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.640
 denounced to the interior of the army 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.810
 national act followed the same finch 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.280
 said from letter 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.069
 that he would take the matter 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.390
 very serious 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.930
 yes no 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.930
 never 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.489
 I of course 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.290
 is doing a judicious analysis 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.300
 For his part, the commander of the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.340
 military forces general leonardo 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.989
 barrero who was also recorded when 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.730
 spoke with the colonel arrested inside 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.770
 of the scandal said that his conversation 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.510
 it had nothing to do with a contract 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.100
 although he offered apologies to the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.110
 prosecutor's office for what he said against his 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.120
 researchers therefore reiterated that a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.920
 thing is an unfortunate comment inside 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.690
 of a private conversation and another 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.910
 different the undue interference in 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.040
 contractual processes to which 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.510
 wants me to link the general pointed out 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.530
 that conversation happened in another 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.150
 stage of his career 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.580
 the conversations were presented in the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.680
 year 2012 when I played as 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.690
 commander of the command set of 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.640
 Occident based in the city of Cali 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.530
 and he also apologized for talking to a 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
 prisoner but mention that starting from 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.580
 principle of good faith I assumed that the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.260
 calls were made in compliance 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.480
 with the standards established by the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.980
 penitentiary regime and added that they will be 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.900
 the control bodies who 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.960
 will determine the responsibilities 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.569
 disciplinary and criminal administrative 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.100
 however another recording that week 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.050
 has not yet published reveals that the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.460
 Colonel prisoner had more information 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.349
 about the location of the general barrero 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.020
 that the same command secretaries 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.610
 ignacio gómez silvia the scandal of 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.520
 corruption that is evident in those 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.520
 recordings is just beginning then 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.729
 only 20 of the 29 thousand are known 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.380
 conversations that the magazine obtained 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.300
 other known resolutions tonight 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.220
 reveal that it was apparently closer to 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.620
 Colonel Gonzalo's relationship with the river 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.139
 with general leonardo barrero today 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.000
 commander of the military forces a 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:52.050
 conversation between Gonzalez and a 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.930
 alleged non-commissioned officer in the neighborhood 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.849
 directly free from the neighborhood without hit 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.860
 but the staff of the contexts of 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.300
 staff of other conversations that 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.190
 are in the hands of the prosecutor's office give 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.500
 understand that the general barrero would have 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.060
 agency or transfers of other military to 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.060
 King's request 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:16.169
 I already told the neighborhood when I listen 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:17.610
 where they put problems seen austerity 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.119
 I already heard the tourist district so 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.119
 you go with him if you 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.229
 I want it to arrive 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:41.320
 yes General Barrero insisted on his 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.770
 statement that he has not committed acts 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.770
 illicit
