 I'm just glad that gives me the confidence »Michels percent in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.870
 Winter brings us 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.450
 it had to go through quickly 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.850
 The coach also has clear ideas about his new game 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.179
 so very easy with his playful skills 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.809
 Munzert had to die at the composite with his rich experience 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 intervention 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.190
 I am 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.570
 actually completely uninhibited myself 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 Map really feel like playing football again to show what I am 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.720
 can 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 I hope that the case still plays along with me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.570
 that does not think that nothing can happen 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.229
 this will be hard at the beginning, i hope i am if i am 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.370
 the game is doing at the point that nothing hurts that 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.100
 everything works fine and that my mind is clear that I think the boys 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.230
 maybe my situation also knew how to play with 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.480
 To challenge the ball 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.000
 to win a free kick or to play these stories all the time 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.900
 Strache play organizers use bit led these are the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.020
 Publishers do not lend themselves as expected that is the club currently on 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.480
 the penultimate place in the table is also due to the numerous fans 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.240
 not without a trace over 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 yes, that has been shown from the outside 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.810
 The fans may seem to have gone huge expectations in Mesum 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.659
 and then it made itself felt in the audience numbers 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.819
 Send percent si 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.650
 that the fans have been disappointed they must be there for a few other reasons 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.580
 again to care for more success his life and quite simply the dock 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.559
 if there is reason to celebrate again 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:25.969
 but clearly because way to make a broadcast so percent our tasks 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:26.629
 fulfill 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.599
 in addition to playful the result in the end it is only 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.749
 until a result and that results from the tasks we are about to do 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.939
 have to deal with 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.319
 say winning duels speaks better you want to score scores 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.529
 and that's why you did not have to do everything else 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.479
 Heiner Parkhaus played in 2009 even for the FC Sachsen Leipzig 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.689

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.399
 I'm completely honest 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.339
 Well, I've played for half a year 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.689
 Of course it went stupid because Moscow, however, have three points for 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.369
 the spö the game at 2 is indeed where he 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.509
 I would rather be the merit of the wm-win then after two first three 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.769
 Game winnings Son after two verbüssten sun 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.440
 I see that quite realistic, the additional amount does not rise and 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.459
 the citizen does not expect to be dismissed one tells the fathers of the council 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.939
