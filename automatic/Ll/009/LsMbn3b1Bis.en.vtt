00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.969
 Many behaviors require animals to communicate. Animals can communicate in a variety of ways. 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.969
 These include chemicals, known as pheromones, sounds and signals, and even dancing. 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.749
 It can be defined as the behavior of an animal 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.199
 Will affect the behavior of another animal in the present or in the future 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.519
 Communication between animals can imply messages or warnings 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.390
 For example: plants send messages through pheromones to try and attract pollination, pheromones can be a hormone 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.590
 For example: attracting a partner in the same species or pheromone can be a chemical 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.570
 Secreted by one animal, another received, pheromone makes communication between animals possible 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 Bees convey a message about food with a special source of dance called "waggle dance" 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.160
 The figure-eight dance tells the bee which direction and how far 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.290
 Round dance tells them that the food is close 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.109
 The sound of the bee dance is filtered by the tiny hair on the bee head. 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:20.400
 So the bees exchange signals through sound and motion, and release pheromones into the environment. 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.179
 Killer whales communicate through sound, sound is a very important way of communication 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.469
 Because the whales in the water are not very good because of their poor vision, the killer whale whistle 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:38.460
 Echo positioning, pulse calling, low frequency calling and tapping 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.560
 Studies have shown that whales sound more frequently as they approach other whales 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.709
 And the team is not vocal when they are scattered. These sounds are considered to be used 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.520
 Group identification and coordination behavior is worth noting 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.200
 Each group of whales has its own unique way of communication 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.649
 Whales can also use a variety of alternating postures and gestures 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.819
 However, we are not clearly understanding its purpose 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.190
 These poses like hitting the squat and hitting each other 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.190
