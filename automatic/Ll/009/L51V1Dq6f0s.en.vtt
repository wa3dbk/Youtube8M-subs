00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.199

 as a result, in the art around 15 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.119
 Percent if the instruction 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.329

 too big 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.030
 the right long time of choice 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.280
 always say such a noise that from the beginning simply taken seriously 9 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.560
 The question never easily arose in the course of time 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.670
 it just so happened that it became so long Lam at ours 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.020
 Thing made and 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.460
 that's 15 years now when you get back it's already crossover 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 Level over it if it's 30 then 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.230
 you want 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.810
 15 years ago, how did you get your hands on the Schöninger we 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.730

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.760
 yes that was so about the dairies still out of kindergarten 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.870

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.390
 and i was just in the rental car like a band grounds and around 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 the market has just begun to take lessons Unna then closely nei 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.770
 was when we got home at the end of the month sentiment 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.399
 Ferrostaal was supposed to introduce the fire brigade to madness 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.880
 cool that I criticized him as Twitter is Owling 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.900
 around 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590
 The murder then had in the Nierstein parallel class 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.350
 Federer served to the bassist 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.360
 below 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.230
 yes there you first the shipping company and 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.230
 these four points are under tel 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.270
 when they have seen the choice at school and the whole game 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 but it must come 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 because if the partner is the 40-year-old Sammer will do 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.240
 to do in the music 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.789
 so big league a german 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.039
 how can that catch my music then the water then catch you as well percent as well 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.319
 that would like to learn her instrument 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 wanted to make music 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.049
 yes most tell how they started 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.139
 To make music 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:30.209
 Ripping open women to impress the front around me it was all about 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.150
 I have the band for the passing of the Doors 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.799
 there are rules says something 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.429
 4 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:42.220
 about 16 years Tollwood Festival in Munich are seen in the tent and 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.360
 he blown me away like that and from that point on I just knew I had to 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.669
 the bones were round again 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.039
 Gruber me 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.750
 Well, my dad is already making music 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.149
 So already musicians 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.639
 is also bassist and 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.109
 I knew they were going to be musicians 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.969
 rather, it is with the women 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.629
 Percent applicable 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.299
 Weseke approx 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.089
 so as a band you are always together quite a lot together how are the Fürth 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.449
 with the 90 sometime on each other's nerves thinks as a student in the 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.649
 Tour bus activities with the fame driver 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:20.939
 and like Sister 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.439
 you go to the sack massively but exactly from this 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.769
 negative energy their tails to the never what positive 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.499
 that's the way it is 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.189
 around 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.009
 yes, no idea life must be the molina like a relationship like approach 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.090
 there must also be failure 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.220
 Lund times in the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.420
 yes, no idea disagreements because 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.420
 that is exactly what the whole thing will sometimes clean up »save 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.639
 by poachers too 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.829
 in plus so there are only pictures end I want her peace in front 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.629
 So for me it's usually so rich Gamers Evans goes 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.139
 and then I say it seems that Sion gently softly on the 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:03.669
 field 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.999
 Heynckes I can sleep 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.029
 Currently, special ones are wrong before 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.029
 Year on the last tour we were not allowed to roll dice in the bus 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.939
 the word 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.599
 GP 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.040
 until after the tour 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.799
 Peneder 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.739
 together too 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.380
 He says a percent big role as a month he wants me sometimes without the 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.380
 Band is without because it is with the members 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.590
 We also hang around without a high school diploma 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.120
 around 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.389
 and that it is raining 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.389
 good at this band agree that 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.770
 the kind no idea so Spiess alone with your best friend in 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.720
 this band and the threshold sometimes also off the band indians on one 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.809
 Beer or you look together like football or something percent 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.789
 luckily we are not a pure working community but 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.779
 On the weekend, it is still 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.610
 Sinning my number at home during the week 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.410
 you also something together 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.410
 These are the key dates to go or in the water 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.789
 yes and that's good 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.580
 do you have so called certain li2o all what yours 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.680
 so together before going on stage or findings 2 going on that well 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.349
 all 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.349
 properly let out the pig or afterwards 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.719
 he stops 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.210
 she was also required to let go 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.930
 that would be 50 percent 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.449
 yes, of course, the little rituals 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.680
 around 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.860
 directly in front of the gig, however 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.979
 around 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:36.800
 Gibbs 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.610
 a ritual 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.939
 Underpants of natural or 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.729
 nothing is needed 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.169
 and after that we used to have it with us 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.650
 Roman for a change, so 0 percent is the long Asum 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.380
 Closing dinner after the tour 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.300
 but that is only done twice 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 but we gave that up 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.189
 what has so 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.639
 the most glaring thing she has on stage 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.169
 Serdar sen again what happened to you on stage now or what you 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.169
 Photo percent I am very hard 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.699
 So those are among the most blatant things that I used to be from the 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.050
 Yesterday, for example, just percent was that 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.869
 booking portal 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:23.129
 around 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.869
 that was incredible 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.189
 What the people did there so Gabi Staake mushroom often only 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:34.439
 That's something I have just never himself in this scale in life 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.719
 seen and test rides on the stage 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.159
 who Maik temptation to the face 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.159
 At least that's what they want, then the minister hopes 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.840
 the users would still be very special experience 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:53.770
 Never before did I fall in front of the stage it is between two boxes 

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:55.410
 it was quite a long time ago 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.409
 I am theirs 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.069
 why a spurt?
