00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:16.379
 the people to take off a hoop for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.420
 put one right now things are still 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.300
 same many people consult for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.970
 remove it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.699
 if in fact, many people want 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.750
 take it away for aesthetic reasons 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.489
 especially those that are located 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.419
 on the face in the neck in zones 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.129
 visible the face then from 95% of 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.019
 the inquiries of people you want 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.780
 remove a mole for aesthetic reasons 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.510
 because the moles are we say 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.970
 genetically designed to have them or to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.250
 that is effectively one is born with the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.680
 Genetic information of how many moles 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.170
 and in what locations will that be? 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.600
 they are appearing then in the course of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.930
 life the vast majority of them almost 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.940
 nobody is born with moles only some 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 people but most are appearing 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.469
 from very early in childhood and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.750
 even in adulthood they can 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.179
 appear some moles and it is also 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.009
 Normal growth polka dots 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.619
 through life what happens is that it is 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.360
 a growth that must be like very 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.840
 slow as to the extent that the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.050
 patient grows and changes too and not a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.060
 thing as 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.120
 uncontrolled very fast because some 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.040
 channels have little hairs like beautiful 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.470
 especially on the face 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.440
 the patients the donor has hairs 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.180
 because it reaches deep down to the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 subcutaneous cellular tissue where they are 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.430
 the annexes then besides growing the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.070
 pigment cells also grow 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.050
 weeks with the basic threads and that's why 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.080
 are moles that can be accompanied 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.450
 of hair or even sebaceous glands 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.370
 for example on the face many moles are 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 inflaman because we're going to give it a 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.290
 swept an injury that I hope was 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.470
 sebaceous gland but that accompanies 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.479
 some polka dots that scare but 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.490
 they would not have risk however action e 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.070
 inflammation is recurrent is a reason 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.950
 to remove and how a mole is removed 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.500
 what is the treatment as such depends 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.360
 the mole of the color depth of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.690
 size a mole like the one you mention 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 with deep pigmented hair is a mole 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.700
 surgical because to get to the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.770
 depth where is that is the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.870
 subcutaneous cellular tissue are the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
 sebaceous glands because it is difficult 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.020
 do it with other methods 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.660
 or you can get there but it's going to leave a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.610
 very big scar a place like this 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.430
 a surgical incision is made should be 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.980
 structure points so that the scar 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.990
 a more superficial mole is more beautiful 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.480
 that has no pigment and the making is a 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.090
 excellent option because it leaves very few and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.010
 no termination and the patient 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.900
 then it recovers very quickly 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.550
 well we talk after this last lunar 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.710
 which is like the simplest one that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.900
 people most wishes to soon remove from 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.150
 the heat approximately in terms of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.690
 sessions are needed to remove a 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.270
 to the simple plane of the common normally to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 a few hours in fact as one tries to 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.170
 remove it completely in one 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.660
 session in the doing is a blind method 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.640
 that means that one is not at a hundred 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.150
 percent sure that I remove all of the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.850
 lunar and that means there's a risk that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.520
 a water grows later we see it with 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.040
 some frequency in surgery is a 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.960
 much more accurate and accurate method 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.540
 effective and also with an envelope 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.030
 process 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.370
 it is eradicated completely they are emerging 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.069
 the methods that sometimes facilitate the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.950
 process then makes it easier 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.650
 remove it with a laser that with surgery 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.629
 but the choice is always made by the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.849
 doctor because doing is a 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.560
 work tool who choose the 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.579
 tools that you will use then it is 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.430
 the specialist according to the location of 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.040
 the lesion the type of lesion the color the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.260
 area where it is the patient who is 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.819
 is generally the front 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.250
 teenagers or very young people 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.280
 that they will remove polka dots if they do not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.599
 does completely have a lot of risk and 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.239
 that today they will grow because it is nothing 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.849
 of growth is not equal in a 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.560
 adult person then all those 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.280
 factors influence to choose the best 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.380
 treatment according to each patient is good 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.000
 but thank you very much and you know 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.710
 if you have a place that does not 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.380
 like or want to take off as they can 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.949
 consult beautiful clinic caring 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.949
