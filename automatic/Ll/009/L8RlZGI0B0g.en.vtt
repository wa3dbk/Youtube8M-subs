STD it's not quite as easy fast there's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.939 
STD it's not quite as easy fast there's
three<00:00:53.059> frames<00:00:53.330> instead<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.809> tea<00:00:53.989> but<00:00:54.890> that's

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
three frames instead of tea but that's

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.229 
three frames instead of tea but that's
still<00:00:55.280> more<00:00:55.430> than<00:00:55.610> enough<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.910> make<00:00:56.059> those

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
still more than enough to make those

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.900 
still more than enough to make those
guys<00:00:56.449> a<00:00:56.480> little<00:00:56.960> bit<00:00:57.080> more<00:00:57.230> unsafe<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:57.980> mean<00:00:58.760> to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
guys a little bit more unsafe I mean to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.360 
guys a little bit more unsafe I mean to
be<00:00:58.940> honest<00:00:59.269> with<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.530> having<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.559> sbd<00:01:01.220> i

be honest with you having that sbd i

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.829 
be honest with you having that sbd i
think<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.820> what<00:01:02.059> makes<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> great

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
think is what makes that the great

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.890 
think is what makes that the great
character<00:01:03.519> ofc<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.699> because<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.300> cannot<00:01:05.540> for

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
character ofc you because you cannot for

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.810 
character ofc you because you cannot for
kicking<00:01:06.170> out<00:01:06.290> couch<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.770> those<00:01:06.979> throws<00:01:07.280> dead

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
kicking out couch that those throws dead

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.710 
kicking out couch that those throws dead
oh<00:01:08.380> my<00:01:09.380> gosh<00:01:09.640> just<00:01:10.640> like<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.030> it's<00:01:11.210> over

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.010 

that's<00:01:14.720> rather<00:01:14.930> unfortunate<00:01:17.020> that's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's rather unfortunate that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.830 
that's rather unfortunate that's
actually<00:01:18.350> one<00:01:18.470> thing<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.950> need<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.220> both<00:01:19.369> sets

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
actually one thing you need to both sets

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.510 
actually one thing you need to both sets
spdr<00:01:20.840> three<00:01:20.990> exhibition<00:01:21.680> isn't<00:01:21.890> just<00:01:22.340> throw

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
spdr three exhibition isn't just throw

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.400 
spdr three exhibition isn't just throw
or<00:01:22.789> hit<00:01:22.820> invincible<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.570> fully<00:01:23.810> invincible

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
or hit invincible it's fully invincible

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.889 
or hit invincible it's fully invincible
so<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.310> need<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.910> safe<00:01:26.119> jump<00:01:26.390> setups<00:01:26.780> and

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
so you need a safe jump setups and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.010 
so you need a safe jump setups and
you'll<00:01:27.080> fall<00:01:27.320> through<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> SPD<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:29.840> hit

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
you'll fall through the SPD and get hit

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.870 
you'll fall through the SPD and get hit
by<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.259> where<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:30.890> like<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.310> say<00:01:31.640> from<00:01:31.789> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
by it where it's like you say from the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.109 
by it where it's like you say from the
char<00:01:32.060> using<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.420> op-ed<00:01:32.899> x<00:01:33.729> that's<00:01:34.729> no<00:01:34.880> closer

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
char using the op-ed x that's no closer

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.870 
char using the op-ed x that's no closer
than<00:01:35.240> there<00:01:35.479> already

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880
