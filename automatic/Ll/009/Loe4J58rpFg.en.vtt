00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.210
 red dead redemption that a bit 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.920

 a few people killed it goes 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.950
 of course, a western and it works 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.580
 that's why the slaves still have it all 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.940
 left before the east north south 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.120
 of course, this slave trader 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.600
 of course played by the great 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.570
 christoph waltz and the django that is 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.620

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.990
 and now he will have it as well 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.900
 tv and the as well as away is like a force 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.500
 gone into sum somehow 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.420
 Candy Candyland and the chef invite 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.010
 of who we know the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.080
 do not give up at ds a good one 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.250
 saleswoman also dresses like that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.250
 five is to know know 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.970
 but that would be janis and that's why 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 he wants to go there and on time 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.160
 take away there for a few farmers 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.350
 load it with sweets and that's why 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.100
 are there namely the bounty hunter 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.100
 is very clear 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.810
 and then you bring some people 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.400
 and because stop is just action 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.850
 Western times clearly there you can not three 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.250
 steps go around without and somebody and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.700
 so on and three hours by the way the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700
 whole thing 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.290
 you're not that we do not know yet 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.840
 but now we know it so far the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.020
 greatest quentin tarantino fan of 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.860
 world agrees that no film misses her 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.060
 At least 20 times each seen too 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.720
 read every film yourself 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.230
 written 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.410
 while then read that is beautiful 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.540
 of course, extremely what what you find from 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.740
 such an idea e mail of the western are yes 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.410
 not really up-to-date scampi anymore 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.220
 these cowboys aliens are with those 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.989
 craig never knows such a bit of cypher 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.670
 and now it's back full time 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.709
 western but i like now i have 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.480
 I love what I do in quite old western 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.310
 So film the really old movies so on 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 a 30 year old movies are the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.250
 hottest it is very light ajar 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.870
 So django is actually synonymous 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.560
 a bit remakes there have been times 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.820
 a movie called that and quentin 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 tarantino waiting fan of the year knows it 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.750
 yes , I would like to explain but for 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.110
 spectators , it would be like that is yes 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.110
 So a movie of the one you all know 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.150
 film raps and always wanted this one 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.820
 western make yes because all his 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 other films are so similar as 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.610
 Spaghetti western turned but stop 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.050
 not as western genre itself but 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.440
 know at all pb 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.440
 the kommune and pulp fiction my and 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.960
 second mafia and finally it is 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.910
 practically a master that should where as well 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.100
 his best movie to be said 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.400
 those lucky ones have seen this 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 to have 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.460
 you did not see what you said 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.460
 you set to the film I think right now 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 so fed is really important 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.720
 leo dicaprio 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.910
 who would have thought so this time as 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.350
 bad I think he has never been so 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.030
 not played in the bad except in this 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.650
 a gradual men succeeded 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.440
 walls what are you hoping for up to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:30.330
 video so maxi the scorpio 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:33.120
 convertible capri-sun ok titanic I was 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.250
 every time every time I was also important 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.410
 the beautiful expensive ship my god real 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.660
 times or in my that so many things 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.860
 can do with just broken 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.540
 gone without shit 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.810
 there are several films of the 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.260
 trailer is so horny and then the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.060
 Movie 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.460
 where is the trailer cutouts now? 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.020
 I did not want to stuff right away 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.120
 why really evil spirits 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.260
 cut out of the trailer hereby 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.010
 the best movie and then the coach so 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.870
 feed with it 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.120
 it works differently and I already had 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:06.560
 times extremely bad traders actually 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.030
 Looked in the movie and bomb bomb 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.980
 that is a tarantino can do that 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.540
 So that 's a duty of protection 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.090
 now it should also give it 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.760
 to save even more shit but the fact that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.230
 track old is the madness so man 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.010
 I am looking forward to a great movie 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.310
 comes in to christmas i believe in 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.320
 the usa in the mooser with us you can 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:34.420
 I believe only in January a 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:39.510
 If we survive these good ideas 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.370
 for the new or for the fans come yes 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:48.070
 first of all, and second, I lose weight 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:50.490
 We would be right the same 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.490
 next video 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.610
