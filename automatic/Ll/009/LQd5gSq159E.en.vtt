00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.700
 cyanotic and cyanotic disorders 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.070
 congenital heart diseases produce their 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.160
 effects through a short circuit 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.500
 abnormal blood and alterations of the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 pulmonary blood flow and usually 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 be classified into those that produce 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.750
 cyanosis and that generate degree 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.820
 little or no 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.670
 Under normal conditions 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.550
 shorts from left to right will 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.400
 classify as non-ticos and those of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.320
 right to left with obstruction are 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.690
 they are not ticos 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.210
 of congenital defects that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.700
 will discuss in this chapter the conduct 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.850
 patent arteriosus defects of the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.100
 the atrial and ventricular septum 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 defects of the endo pads 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 meat valve stenosis 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.480
 pulmonary and the fourth action of the aorta 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 they are defects that produce cyanosis 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.969
 scarce or null 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 the tetralogy of fallot and the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.049
 transposition of the great vessels are 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.049
 defects that cause cyanosis 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.750
 the presence of a short circuit 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.600
 blood involves the derivation of the flow 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.909
 Blood from one system to the other opens 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.799
 parentheses from the arterial system 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.229
 towards the venous 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.869
 that is short of left to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.320
 right or from the venous system to 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.909
 arterial or short right 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.909
 left closes parentheses 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 in congenital heart disease this 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.300
 short of the blood depends on the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.820
 presence of an abnormal hole between 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.670
 the right and left circulations and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.659
 of the degree of resistance to flow to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.659
 through this hole 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.660
 the short circuit from right to left 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.700
 determines the blood movement of 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 shock follows nothing from the right side 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.650
 from the heart to the left and its 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 subsequent choice towards circulation 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.160
 systemic 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.380
 when a sufficient amount of blood 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420
 of that demands nothing mixes with the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 oxygenated blood from the left side of the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 heart develops cyanosis 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.360
 in the short circuits from left to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.879
 right blood prepared for 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.310
 systemic circulation that circulates to 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.090
 through the right side of the heart and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.090
 go back to the lungs 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.280
 this increase in volume stretches the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.709
 right side of the heart and the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.990
 pulmonary circulation and increases the load 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.440
 on the right ventricle 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.060
 in children with septal defects 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.610
 associated with short 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.100
 left to right is usually observed 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.440
 increase in the size of structures 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.570
 that make up the right side of the heart 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.570
 and of the pulmonary blood vessels 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.510
 vascular resistance 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 systemic and pulmonary circulations can 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.580
 influence the direction of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.190
 short circuit 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.950
 how pulmonary vascular resistance is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.770
 elevated in the neonate the defects 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.200
 headphones and the wall are not usually 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 produce a significant short circuit 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.080
 no symptoms during the first weeks 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.080
 of life 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.019
 when the smooth muscle of the steps 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.640
 pulmonary regresses in the infant the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.879
 resistance of the pulmonary circulation 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.299
 usually it falls below which 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.760
 observed in the systemic circulation in 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.670
 the uncomplicated defects of a partition 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.650
 atrial or ventricular blood 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.350
 diverts from the left side of the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.970
 heart towards the right 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.300
 when the septum defect 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.250
 ventricular is more complex the increase 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.730
 of the flow resistance can 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 affect the short circuit pattern 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.269
 for example the defects that increase the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 resistance to flow in the aorta opens 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.819
 bracket valve stenosis 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.000
 Aortic fourth action of the aorta closes 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.610
 parentheses increase the magnitude of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.370
 short from left to right and 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.410
 those that obstruct the pulmonary flow opens 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.780
 bracket valve stenosis 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.949
 pulmonary resistance increase 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.240
 pulmonary vascular closes parentheses 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.010
 increase the magnitude of 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.010
 short from right to left 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.140
 the crying can increase the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.170
 short from right to left in 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.910
 infants with septal defects 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.780
 by increasing vascular resistance 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.970
 pulmonary this could be one of the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.640
 reasons why some infants 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.140
 with congenital heart diseases are put 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.140
 cyanotic when they cry
