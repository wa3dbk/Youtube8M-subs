is<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.230> good<00:00:50.469> is<00:00:50.590> probably<00:00:50.920> marketable<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:51.760> I

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
is this good is probably marketable so I

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.450 
is this good is probably marketable so I
can<00:00:52.000> sell<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.199> did<00:00:53.739> make<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.129> doll<00:00:54.309> we

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
can sell it so I did make the doll we
