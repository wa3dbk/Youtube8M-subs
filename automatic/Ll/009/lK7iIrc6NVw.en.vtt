00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
of the a7r it's specifically made for

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.010 
of the a7r it's specifically made for
this<00:00:14.519> camera<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.150> see<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> fits<00:00:15.780> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
this camera and you can see it fits it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.870 
this camera and you can see it fits it
like<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.440> made<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
like it's made for it because it is and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.590 
like it's made for it because it is and
you<00:00:18.480> still<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.869> access<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> mic<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.699> and

you still have access to the mic in and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.810 
you still have access to the mic in and
all<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> other<00:00:22.529> ports<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> side<00:00:23.430> there

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
all the other ports on the side there

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.150 
all the other ports on the side there
and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> also<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.410> access<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and then you also have access to the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
and then you also have access to the
battery<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> gives<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.840> nice<00:00:27.990> little<00:00:28.500> bit

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
battery and it gives a nice little bit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
battery and it gives a nice little bit
of<00:00:28.710> protection<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> camera<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.929> case

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of protection to the camera so in case

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
of protection to the camera so in case
you<00:00:31.380> nudge<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.099> against<00:00:32.399> something<00:00:32.669> or

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you nudge it on against something or

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.040 
you nudge it on against something or
drop<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> or<00:00:33.360> whatever<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:33.870> bit<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
drop it or whatever a little bit of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
drop it or whatever a little bit of
extra<00:00:34.320> protection<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.160> sides<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.880> gives

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
extra protection on two sides and gives

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
extra protection on two sides and gives
it<00:00:36.570> adds<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> grip<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.920> feels<00:00:38.280> better<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it adds to the grip it feels better in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.510 
it adds to the grip it feels better in
the<00:00:38.850> hand<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.340> actually<00:00:41.340> adds

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the hand with this on and actually adds

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
the hand with this on and actually adds
a<00:00:41.760> little<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> bulk<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> camera<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
a little bit of bulk to the camera so I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
a little bit of bulk to the camera so I
think<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.070> allow<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.059> hold<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
think it's going to allow you to hold it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.100 
think it's going to allow you to hold it
steady

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
steady

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
steady
and<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> thirty-six<00:00:47.430> megapixel

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and with this thirty-six megapixel

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
and with this thirty-six megapixel
full-frame<00:00:48.360> sensor<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
full-frame sensor you really need to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
full-frame sensor you really need to
hold<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> camera<00:00:50.370> steady<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:51.090> you're

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hold this camera steady when you're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
hold this camera steady when you're
taking<00:00:51.570> shots<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.170> any<00:00:52.379> movement<00:00:52.559> will

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
taking shots because any movement will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
taking shots because any movement will
show<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.120> that's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.420> plus<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.469> biggest

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
show up so that's a plus but the biggest

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
show up so that's a plus but the biggest
plus<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.730> arca-swiss<00:00:57.379> compatibility<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
plus is the arca-swiss compatibility of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
plus is the arca-swiss compatibility of
this<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> you'll<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.670> here<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
this and you'll see here I'm going to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.939 
this and you'll see here I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> tripod

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
demonstrate when I put it on a tripod

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.820 
demonstrate when I put it on a tripod
how<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.210> already<00:01:03.870> has<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.439> built-in

going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> review<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> cage<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
going to have a review on a cage that I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.580 
going to have a review on a cage that I
have<00:01:44.280> ordered<00:01:44.640> coming<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> a7r<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have ordered coming in for the a7r and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
have ordered coming in for the a7r and
here's<00:01:47.159> an<00:01:47.310> articulated<00:01:48.060> arm<00:01:48.240> again

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
here's an articulated arm again

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.960 
here's an articulated arm again
quarter-twenty<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.950> its<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.460> unique<00:01:50.820> how

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
quarter-twenty and its really unique how

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.460 
quarter-twenty and its really unique how
this<00:01:51.180> works<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> show<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
this works I'm going to show you at the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.209 
this works I'm going to show you at the
end<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.240> snugs<00:01:54.240> down<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
end how this snugs down when we get to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.969 
end how this snugs down when we get to
that<00:01:56.399> point<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.560> items

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that point but these are just some items

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
that point but these are just some items
that<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.909> work<00:02:00.180> together<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that that will all work together in

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
that that will all work together in
unison<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> camera<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.490> locked

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
unison for when the camera is locked

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
unison for when the camera is locked
down<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> want<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.899> put<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
down and you want to put like a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.100 
down and you want to put like a
recording<00:02:04.829> device<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.579> extra<00:02:06.119> lighting<00:02:06.390> or

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
recording device or extra lighting or

recording device or extra lighting or
other<00:02:07.500> things<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.849> tripod<00:02:09.319> when<00:02:10.319> you're

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
other things on the tripod when you're

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800 
other things on the tripod when you're
shooting<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> fixed<00:02:12.000> location

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
shooting at a fixed location

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.809

with<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> camera<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.010> lockdown<00:02:14.489> situation

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
with a camera in a lockdown situation

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.540 
with a camera in a lockdown situation
this<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.200> quite<00:02:16.410> an<00:02:16.620> articulated<00:02:17.370> on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
this is really quite an articulated on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.130 
this is really quite an articulated on
there<00:02:17.760> by<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> way<00:02:18.390> when<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> snug<00:02:18.930> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there by the way when you snug that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
there by the way when you snug that
centerpiece<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:20.069> tightens<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.239> ball

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
centerpiece it tightens the the ball

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
centerpiece it tightens the the ball
joints<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.020> either<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.530> simultaneously<00:02:23.390> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
joints on either side simultaneously so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.479 
joints on either side simultaneously so
it's<00:02:24.599> kind<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.959> neat<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.650> tighten<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.310> one

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
it's kind of neat to just tighten at one

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
it's kind of neat to just tighten at one
point<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.209> everything<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.900> locks<00:02:28.260> into

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
point and everything just locks into

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
point and everything just locks into
place<00:02:28.880> once<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.150> everything<00:02:30.360> where<00:02:30.690> you

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
here we are back to the Enduro tripod

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.680 
here we are back to the Enduro tripod
and<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> review<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.360> Enduro

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and I have a review on the Enduro

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.140 
and I have a review on the Enduro
tripods<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.530> well<00:02:58.799> but<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.790> see<00:02:59.970> that's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
tripods as well but you can see that's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.539 
tripods as well but you can see that's
arca-swiss<00:03:00.660> compatible<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:02.340> took<00:03:02.489> that

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
arca-swiss compatible I just took that

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.809 
arca-swiss compatible I just took that
that<00:03:03.150> piece<00:03:03.450> off<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.959> came<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.819> tripod

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
that piece off that came with the tripod

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.210 
that piece off that came with the tripod
and<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:06.330> I'm<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:07.019> using<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.590> camera<00:03:07.769> this

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and now I'm just using the camera this

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.580 
and now I'm just using the camera this
this<00:03:08.580> new<00:03:08.849> L<00:03:09.180> bracket<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:10.080> goes<00:03:10.260> right<00:03:10.530> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
this new L bracket just goes right in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.140 
this new L bracket just goes right in
because<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.459> arca-swiss

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
because it is arca-swiss

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.650 
because it is arca-swiss
design<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.190> goes<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.180> of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
design so it just goes right in and of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.420 
design so it just goes right in and of
course<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> horizontal<00:03:16.890> or

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
course that's in the horizontal or

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.789 
course that's in the horizontal or
landscape<00:03:17.870> orientation<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.650> can

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
landscape orientation and then you can

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.590 
landscape orientation and then you can
see<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.489> side<00:03:20.730> going<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
see on the side going up on the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.090 
see on the side going up on the
left-hand<00:03:21.989> side<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.410> camera<00:03:22.739> there<00:03:22.950> is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
left-hand side of the camera there is

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.250 
left-hand side of the camera there is
the<00:03:23.700> other<00:03:23.850> part<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.299> L<00:03:24.390> bracket<00:03:24.930> which

the other part of the L bracket which
again<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.799> arca-swiss<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.760> we're<00:03:26.940> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> be

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
again is arca-swiss so we're going to be

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.240 
again is arca-swiss so we're going to be

that thing moving it's not budging and

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.289 
that thing moving it's not budging and
again<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.100> fits<00:03:50.340> right<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> bottom<00:03:51.209> of

that camera really really fits the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.539 
that camera really really fits the
contours<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> camera<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:56.340> doesn't

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
contours of the camera and just doesn't

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.039 
contours of the camera and just doesn't
seem<00:03:56.850> like<00:03:56.880> it's<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.450> anywhere<00:03:57.540> really

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
seem like it's going anywhere really

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.750

right stuff has one of these for about a
hundred<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.030> eighty<00:04:00.209> dollars<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.930> seems

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
hundred and eighty dollars that seems

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.930 
hundred and eighty dollars that seems
like<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.799> same<00:04:01.980> thing<00:04:02.040> tell<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
like it's the same thing tell you the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.490 
like it's the same thing tell you the
truth<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.540> course<00:04:03.750> really<00:04:03.900> write<00:04:04.170> stuff<00:04:04.440> that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
truth of course really write stuff that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.370 
truth of course really write stuff that
stuff<00:04:04.829> it's<00:04:05.040> made<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.340> USA<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.200> was

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
stuff it's made in the USA but this was

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.379 
stuff it's made in the USA but this was
about<00:04:07.530> thirty<00:04:07.859> five<00:04:08.040> dollars<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.120> think

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
about thirty five dollars and I think

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.440 
about thirty five dollars and I think
well<00:04:10.049> worth<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.819> you<00:04:11.970> do<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> lot<00:04:12.420> of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
well worth it or if you do a lot of

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420 
well worth it or if you do a lot of
tripod<00:04:12.989> work<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.620> your<00:04:13.709> camera<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.220> and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
tripod work and your camera is on and

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.190 
tripod work and your camera is on and
off<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.730> tripod<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.209> lot<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.959> going<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
off of the tripod a lot it's going to

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.620 
off of the tripod a lot it's going to
really<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:17.459> comfortable<00:04:17.850> situation<00:04:18.150> for

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
really be a comfortable situation for

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.190 
really be a comfortable situation for
you<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.200> work<00:04:19.709> fast<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:21.060> your<00:04:21.690> camera<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.080> not

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
you and work fast and your camera is not

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.110 
you and work fast and your camera is not
going<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.500> drop<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.950> did<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.610> review<00:04:23.909> on<00:04:23.970> these

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
going to drop I did a review on these

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.360 
going to drop I did a review on these
plastic<00:04:24.630> cases<00:04:25.050> previously<00:04:25.409> as<00:04:25.740> well<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.310> you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
plastic cases previously as well and you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.540 
plastic cases previously as well and you
can

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
can

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.460 
can
see<00:04:26.759> this<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> perfect<00:04:27.690> example<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:28.229> how<00:04:28.289> we

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
see this is a perfect example of how we

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.360 
see this is a perfect example of how we
use<00:04:28.620> these<00:04:29.099> we've<00:04:29.520> got<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:30.090> arca-swiss<00:04:31.370> items

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
use these we've got the arca-swiss items

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.379 
use these we've got the arca-swiss items
in<00:04:32.550> here<00:04:32.759> we've<00:04:32.909> got<00:04:33.030> some<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.270> these

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
in here we've got some of these

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.180 
in here we've got some of these
quarter-twenty<00:04:33.900> adapters<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.889> some<00:04:35.039> other

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
quarter-twenty adapters and some other

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.219 
quarter-twenty adapters and some other
miscellaneous<00:04:35.430> things<00:04:35.849> this<00:04:36.659> goes<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.080> my

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
miscellaneous things this goes in my

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.200 
miscellaneous things this goes in my
lighting<00:04:37.620> case<00:04:37.860> which<00:04:38.250> again<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.819> case<00:04:39.030> I

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
lighting case which again is the case I

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.820 
lighting case which again is the case I
would<00:04:39.389> probably<00:04:39.509> bring<00:04:39.840> along<00:04:40.110> if<00:04:40.379> I'm<00:04:40.530> locked

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
would probably bring along if I'm locked

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.520 
would probably bring along if I'm locked
down<00:04:41.069> for<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.520> shoot<00:04:41.789> on<00:04:42.270> location<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.349> might

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
down for a shoot on location and I might

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.379 
down for a shoot on location and I might
need<00:04:43.680> some<00:04:43.949> of<00:04:44.069> these<00:04:44.129> things<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.240> can

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
need some of these things so you can

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.969 
need some of these things so you can
just<00:04:45.509> glance<00:04:45.750> right<00:04:46.080> in<00:04:46.259> you<00:04:46.409> can<00:04:46.560> see<00:04:46.770> what's

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
just glance right in you can see what's

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.610 
just glance right in you can see what's
in<00:04:47.190> there<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:48.030> can<00:04:48.180> find<00:04:48.389> those<00:04:48.629> small<00:04:49.229> items

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
in there you can find those small items

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.930 
in there you can find those small items
quickly<00:04:49.800> with<00:04:50.159> a<00:04:50.190> clear<00:04:50.460> case<00:04:50.639> like<00:04:50.909> that

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
quickly with a clear case like that

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.450 
quickly with a clear case like that
again<00:04:51.720> here<00:04:51.930> are<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.050> articulated<00:04:52.830> arms<00:04:53.190> and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
again here are the articulated arms and

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.969 
again here are the articulated arms and
when<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.449> get<00:04:54.599> it<00:04:54.750> into<00:04:54.900> position<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.740> I'm

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
when you get it into position and I'm

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.110 
when you get it into position and I'm
