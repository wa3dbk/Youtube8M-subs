key ID is a little HD of course it's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.469 
key ID is a little HD of course it's
just<00:01:03.040> 960<00:01:04.030> x<00:01:04.379> 55<00:01:05.379> on<00:01:05.650> droid<00:01:05.860> 40<00:01:06.549> points<00:01:07.000> but

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
just 960 x 55 on droid 40 points but

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.940 
just 960 x 55 on droid 40 points but
it's<00:01:07.659> better<00:01:07.840> alpha<00:01:08.140> battery<00:01:08.290> because<00:01:08.560> if<00:01:08.830> you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
it's better alpha battery because if you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's better alpha battery because if you
have<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.130> full<00:01:09.340> HD<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.760> course<00:01:10.000> all<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.689> pixel

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
have a full HD of course all the pixel

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.289 
have a full HD of course all the pixel
must<00:01:11.260> use<00:01:11.439> battery<00:01:11.799> so<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.250> will<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.670> more

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
must use battery so you will have more

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.700 
must use battery so you will have more
good<00:01:13.420> battery<00:01:13.720> with<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:13.900> touch<00:01:14.080> screen<00:01:14.110> this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
good battery with this touch screen this

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.730 
good battery with this touch screen this
Katrina<00:01:15.189> use<00:01:15.490> technology<00:01:16.299> OGS<00:01:17.140> that's<00:01:17.470> mean

use Audrey the four point four point two
is<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.680> last<00:01:35.950> solution<00:01:36.430> for<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.060> read

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
is the last solution for on the read

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.120 
is the last solution for on the read
that<00:01:37.659> mean<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:37.990> will<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.590> last<00:01:38.920> two
