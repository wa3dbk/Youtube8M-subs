00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.429 

I<00:01:20.719> think<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.680> bring<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.399> lot<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.729> laughter<00:01:23.259> it's<00:01:24.259> a

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
I think I bring a lot of laughter it's a

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.090 
I think I bring a lot of laughter it's a
very<00:01:24.770> intense<00:01:25.520> training<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.860> there's<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.920> lot

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
very intense training and there's a lot

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.999 
very intense training and there's a lot
of<00:01:28.570> self-observation<00:01:29.570> that's<00:01:30.350> involved<00:01:30.740> when

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
of self-observation that's involved when

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.740 
of self-observation that's involved when
you<00:01:31.100> study<00:01:31.399> yoga<00:01:31.820> when<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.119> practice<00:01:32.539> yoga

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
you study yoga when you practice yoga

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.690 
you study yoga when you practice yoga
when<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.560> take<00:01:33.740> these<00:01:33.860> teacher<00:01:34.130> trainings

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
when you take these teacher trainings

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.899 
when you take these teacher trainings
it's<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.970> very<00:01:35.149> in-depth<00:01:35.659> study<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.729> yoga<00:01:37.729> and

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
it's a very in-depth study of yoga and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.399 
it's a very in-depth study of yoga and
that's<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.450> very<00:01:38.630> in-depth<00:01:39.020> study<00:01:39.289> of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
that's it's a very in-depth study of

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.679 
that's it's a very in-depth study of
yourself<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.399> at<00:01:40.549> times<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.179> can<00:01:41.270> feel<00:01:41.329> very

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
yourself so at times it can feel very

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.809 
yourself so at times it can feel very
intense<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:42.649> overwhelming<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.729> I

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
intense and very overwhelming and I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.850 
intense and very overwhelming and I
think<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.149> very<00:01:44.569> important<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.350> remember<00:01:45.619> to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
think it's very important to remember to

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.559 
think it's very important to remember to
laugh<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.250> lot<00:01:46.399> while<00:01:46.700> you're<00:01:46.850> practicing<00:01:47.030> and

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
laugh a lot while you're practicing and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.550 
laugh a lot while you're practicing and
studying

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.410 

my<00:01:51.220> favorite<00:01:51.610> thing<00:01:51.759> about<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.000> teachers

my favorite thing about the teachers

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.660 
my favorite thing about the teachers
training<00:01:52.659> specifically<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.250> study<00:01:54.549> of

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
training specifically is the study of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.630 
training specifically is the study of
the<00:01:55.240> asana<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:56.020> very<00:01:56.259> precise<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:56.829> exact

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
the asana the very precise and exact

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.510 
the asana the very precise and exact
correct<00:01:58.270> optimal<00:01:59.200> form<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.890> you<00:01:59.920> want<00:02:00.310> your

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
correct optimal form that you want your

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.730 
correct optimal form that you want your
body<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.850> be<00:02:00.939> in<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.509> all<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.380> different

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
postures and then once you learn that

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.230

correct<00:02:05.470> form<00:02:05.860> my<00:02:06.460> other<00:02:06.670> favorite<00:02:07.030> part<00:02:07.210> of

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
correct form my other favorite part of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.089 
correct form my other favorite part of
the<00:02:07.330> teacher<00:02:07.539> training<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.259> having<00:02:08.950> people

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
the teacher training is having people

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.740 
the teacher training is having people
actually<00:02:09.610> start<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.910> teach<00:02:10.179> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
actually start to teach it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.620
