00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.910 
know that's just a big difference and it
just<00:03:29.730> doesn't<00:03:30.450> look<00:03:30.510> right<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.650> car<00:03:31.890> should

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
just doesn't look right the car should

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.680 
just doesn't look right the car should
be<00:03:32.190> running<00:03:32.519> fast<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.030> made<00:03:33.180> by<00:03:33.330> themselves

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
be running fast and made by themselves

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.140 
be running fast and made by themselves
and<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.049> it's<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.350> good<00:03:34.470> move<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.790> think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
and I think it's a good move and I think

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880 
and I think it's a good move and I think
it<00:03:36.209> will<00:03:36.269> make<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.570> racing<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.350> whole<00:03:37.680> lot

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it will make the racing a whole lot

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.210 
it will make the racing a whole lot
better<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.540> we'll<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.660> back<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.799> know
