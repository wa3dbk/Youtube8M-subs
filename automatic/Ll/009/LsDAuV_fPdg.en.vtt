of people who use a so doll to do

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
of people who use a so doll to do
something<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.810> they're<00:01:12.810> running<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
something like this they're running it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
something like this they're running it
down<00:01:13.500> underneath<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:15.360> cutting<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
down underneath them just cutting the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.950 
down underneath them just cutting the
nails<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:16.700> I'm<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.760> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.540> for

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
nails off I'm not going to do that for

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.820 
nails off I'm not going to do that for
two<00:01:19.500> reasons<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
two reasons one is when you do that the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.690 
two reasons one is when you do that the
saw<00:01:23.100> blade<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:24.330> make<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> slot<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.230> kerf<00:01:25.770> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
saw blade will make a slot or kerf in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
saw blade will make a slot or kerf in
the<00:01:27.150> wood<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.440> want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.950> save<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the wood and if you want to save all the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.870 
the wood and if you want to save all the
wood<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.850> don't

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
wood you can like I do then you don't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.600 
wood you can like I do then you don't
want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.330> be<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.660> of<00:01:33.720> slot<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.610> another

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
want to be kind of slot that another

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.500 
want to be kind of slot that another
reason<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:37.040> unless<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> lot<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
reason is that unless you have a lot of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.010 
reason is that unless you have a lot of
muscle<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.950> hard<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:41.340> control<00:01:42.020> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
muscle these are very hard to control to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.460 
muscle these are very hard to control to
be<00:01:43.170> able<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.830> well<00:01:44.190> as<00:01:44.460> safely<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:46.290> need

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
be able to do it well as safely you need

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
be able to do it well as safely you need
to<00:01:46.620> be<00:01:46.770> able<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.100> hold<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> tight<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.030> against

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to be able to hold it tight up against

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.830 
to be able to hold it tight up against
there<00:01:48.690> as<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.110> blade<00:01:49.590> moves<00:01:49.890> back<00:01:50.390> just<00:01:51.390> want

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.660 
that are used this thing have you
straight<00:02:33.840> sided<00:02:34.840> nails

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
straight sided nails

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.840 
straight sided nails
so<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:37.030> anyway<00:02:37.060> without<00:02:37.690> further<00:02:38.080> ado<00:02:38.850> all

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
so but anyway without further ado all

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.770 
so but anyway without further ado all
you<00:02:40.000> really<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:48.780> you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
you really have to do is that do you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.620 
you really have to do is that do you
take<00:02:50.020> these<00:02:50.260> empties<00:02:50.860> yeah<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.670> common<00:02:52.330> problem

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
take these empties yeah a common problem

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.250 
take these empties yeah a common problem
is<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.160> wood<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.400> already<00:02:54.910> split<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
is that the wood is already split and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.090 
is that the wood is already split and
when<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:57.480> use<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.660> crowbar<00:02:58.930> you'll<00:02:59.590> split<00:02:59.860> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
when you use the crowbar you'll split it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.050 
when you use the crowbar you'll split it
more<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:02.350> might<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> do<00:03:03.520> just<00:03:03.910> a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
more so you might have to do just a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.380 
more so you might have to do just a
little<00:03:04.360> bit<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.519> then<00:03:06.519> when<00:03:06.760> your<00:03:06.910> crowbar

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
little bit of it then when your crowbar

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.220 
little bit of it then when your crowbar
further<00:03:07.720> down<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:10.150> side<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.630> nail<00:03:10.900> or

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
further down on the side the nail or

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.979 
further down on the side the nail or
under<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.680> or<00:03:11.830> something<00:03:12.600> pull<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.930> way

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
under it or something pull it this way

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.470 
under it or something pull it this way
that<00:03:14.680> will<00:03:14.950> minimize<00:03:15.160> hand<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> wood

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
that will minimize hand on the wood

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.240 
that will minimize hand on the wood
split<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:19.060> can<00:03:19.120> also<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.959> pull<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
split you can also just pull it to the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.750 
split you can also just pull it to the
side<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.940> jerk<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.390> off<00:03:22.570> but<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.700> way<00:03:24.700> to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
side and jerk it off but that way to

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.990 
side and jerk it off but that way to
make<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> wood<00:03:25.390> split<00:03:25.780> too<00:03:26.670> pretty<00:03:27.670> badly

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
make the wood split too pretty badly

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.830 
make the wood split too pretty badly
sometimes<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.709> there<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.100> have<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.489> now<00:03:30.840> you

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
sometimes so there you have it now you

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.860 
sometimes so there you have it now you
left<00:03:32.260> with<00:03:32.500> these<00:03:32.650> nails<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.510> can<00:03:34.690> beat

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
left with these nails that you can beat

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.130 
left with these nails that you can beat
straight<00:03:35.290> or<00:03:35.470> they<00:03:35.590> already<00:03:35.799> are<00:03:36.010> straight

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
straight or they already are straight

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.220 
straight or they already are straight
take<00:03:38.140> your<00:03:38.350> handy<00:03:38.709> hammer

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
shoot him against a secure surface which

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.960 
shoot him against a secure surface which
this<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:47.049> isn't<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
this really isn't and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.360 
this really isn't and
I'm<00:03:51.970> over<00:03:52.210> like<00:03:52.390> I'm<00:03:52.600> doing<00:03:52.990> with<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> secure

I'm over like I'm doing with a secure
surface<00:03:55.650> they<00:03:56.650> should<00:03:56.860> come<00:03:57.010> out<00:03:57.160> pretty

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
surface they should come out pretty

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.500 
surface they should come out pretty
easily<00:03:59.070> as<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:00.340> may<00:04:00.490> have<00:04:00.520> discovered<00:04:01.360> or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
easily as you may have discovered or

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.710 
easily as you may have discovered or
already<00:04:01.690> known

once<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.900> get<00:04:05.050> these<00:04:05.350> this<00:04:06.010> side<00:04:06.340> off<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.910> fun

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
once you get these this side off the fun

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.920 
once you get these this side off the fun
begin<00:04:07.750> now<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.710> can<00:04:09.100> just<00:04:09.250> simply<00:04:09.720> beat<00:04:10.720> that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
begin now you can just simply beat that

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.260 
begin now you can just simply beat that
off<00:04:11.110> with<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> hammer<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.980> course<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:13.060> best

off with a hammer of course the best

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.330 
off with a hammer of course the best
thing<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.570> do<00:04:13.870> would<00:04:14.140> be<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.350> support<00:04:14.980> this

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
thing to do would be to support this

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.820 
thing to do would be to support this
board<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.840> workbench<00:04:17.410> or<00:04:17.890> something<00:04:18.570> sturdy

to<00:04:20.830> get<00:04:21.010> those<00:04:21.220> off<00:04:21.459> grip<00:04:22.560> but<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:23.800> can<00:04:24.010> still

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
to get those off grip but you can still

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.140 
to get those off grip but you can still
use<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:26.280> crowbar<00:04:27.280> as<00:04:27.730> well<00:04:28.890> as<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.580> said<00:04:30.640> this

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
use the crowbar as well as I said this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.020 
use the crowbar as well as I said this
one<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:32.350> embarrassingly<00:04:33.190> easy<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.790> take

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
one just embarrassingly easy to take

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.050 
one just embarrassingly easy to take
apart<00:04:34.800> many<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:36.010> them<00:04:36.160> are<00:04:36.310> put<00:04:36.490> together<00:04:36.730> with

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
apart many of them are put together with

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.260 
apart many of them are put together with
nail<00:04:37.420> guns<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.230> have<00:04:38.500> these<00:04:38.850> nails<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.240> look

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
nail guns that have these nails to look

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.020 
nail guns that have these nails to look
like<00:04:40.630> screws<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:42.460> they<00:04:42.580> have<00:04:42.730> what<00:04:42.940> they

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
like screws and if they have what they

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.820 
like screws and if they have what they
call<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> ring<00:04:43.510> shank<00:04:43.810> nail<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.380> they<00:04:44.470> have<00:04:44.620> one

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
call a ring shank nail and they have one

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.620 
call a ring shank nail and they have one
with<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.010> square<00:04:45.400> cross<00:04:45.730> section<00:04:45.760> that's<00:04:46.420> been

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
with a square cross section that's been

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.660 
with a square cross section that's been
twisted<00:04:47.230> those<00:04:48.160> can<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:50.190> horrible<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.370> get<00:04:51.520> out

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
twisted those can be horrible to get out

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.640 
twisted those can be horrible to get out
of<00:04:51.850> there<00:04:51.970> especially<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.900> wood<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.170> oak

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
of there especially if the wood is oak

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.240 
of there especially if the wood is oak
or<00:04:54.270> some<00:04:55.270> really<00:04:55.720> hard<00:04:56.050> wood<00:04:56.350> like<00:04:56.650> that

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
or some really hard wood like that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.330 
or some really hard wood like that
as<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.060> said<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.720> was<00:04:58.930> easy<00:04:58.960> it's<00:04:59.620> pine<00:04:59.950> I

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
as I said this was easy it's pine I

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.660 
as I said this was easy it's pine I
believe<00:05:00.700> or<00:05:01.770> looks<00:05:02.770> like<00:05:02.860> time<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.430> me<00:05:03.580> it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
believe or looks like time to me it

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.760 
believe or looks like time to me it
could<00:05:03.850> be<00:05:03.880> cedar<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.690> see<00:05:04.990> some<00:05:05.200> dark<00:05:05.410> grain

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
could be cedar but I see some dark grain

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.980 
could be cedar but I see some dark grain
anyway

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
anyway

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.920 
anyway
so<00:05:08.530> don't<00:05:08.680> be<00:05:08.830> surprised<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.670> you<00:05:10.450> go<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.660> take

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
so don't be surprised if you go to take

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.540
