00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
I take this part pull the end to the

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.130 
I take this part pull the end to the
middle<00:03:07.909> line<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.900> same<00:03:12.079> with

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
middle line like that do the same with

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.789 
middle line like that do the same with
the<00:03:12.439> other<00:03:12.469> side<00:03:19.689> now<00:03:20.689> take<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.170> top<00:03:21.200> part

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
the other side now take the top part

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.349 
the other side now take the top part
right<00:03:22.129> here<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:23.470> fold<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.769> along<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.670> top<00:03:26.090> of

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
not take the bottom here and bring it up

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:47.840 
not take the bottom here and bring it up
