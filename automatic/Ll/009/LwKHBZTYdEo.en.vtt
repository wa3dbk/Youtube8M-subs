00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.430
 Well, today is June 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.830
 on the 28th of 2013 look at you I love you 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.460
 teach before you start the second 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.530
 class that we're going to start today 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.190
 what can be done with the gouges 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 quality 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 this is a detailed facet on a throne 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.160
 this lady my father 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.090
 This throne was made by my grandfather the saint 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.239
 grave grave grave grave 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.130
 furniture with decoration carvings 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.100
 carved bedrooms 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.650
 even the railings the railings that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.900
 they carry figures we also make them 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.160
 we make with the gouges 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.160
 various thrones 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.090
 Well, all these works are 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.240
 made with the gouge 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.970
 anyway because I tell you this because everything 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.520
 this would not be possible or like more or 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.750
 like less but you can not argue with me 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.880
 that this would not be possible without 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 learn to sharpen the gouge without knowing 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.960
 handle the gouges 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.159
 I know that these first classes are very 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 heavy because it costs a lot to handle it 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.759
 you already want to let go and do and do 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.560
 virginies but really if we do not know 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.009
 treat the gouges if we do not know how to sharpen 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.649
 the gouges if we do not have practices or 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.049
 handling with our hands we can never 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.159
 I work so much emphasis is , 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.869
 what 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.210
 I ask for patience and this is the pillars 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.770
 fundamentals of our of our 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.850
 trade without this it is impossible to carve you 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.580
 I'm going to say look at a gouge 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.810
 because this rain is mediated by a lot 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.170
 that we want to cut with this rain 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 we will never be able to cut 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.140
 a gouge if I do not know how to tune the other 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.900
 gouge this average 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.480
 impossible to cut me never so very good 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.290
 is ready that is never I will never be able 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.740
 now cut well a gouge that is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.420
 sharp 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.700
 We'll see what we give you with it because 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.820
 we can direct them we can chop 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.830
 with them we can make my figure and the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.990
 We will take where we want 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.870
 once we know how to cut the ways 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.610
 If the gouge is sharp, we can 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.040
 do what they want we thought about it 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.890
 the rains 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 Today I am going to teach you how to sharpen and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.909
 gouge 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.340
 let's start tuning a half-round 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.939
 a half cane that is not that it does not have 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.430
 that is not very closed that is with a 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.799
 half - round because of the three blondes 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.060
 I told you that they were fundamental for 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.060
 start then that half-round 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.300
 this half-round we're going to fine tune what 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.040
 we will start here then a stone 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.770
 of sharpening the test refine a stone of 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.480
 sharpen how we can find them 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.180
 we can find in any 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.730
 hardware store because there are different grains 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.890
 one are a little more vast others are 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.310
 a little thinner are not worth much money 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.580
 the luck of this this work is that 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.590
 our tools towards the end 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.590
 they are expensive is why 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.360
 the stones are worth little money the gouges 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.700
 they are really worth little money look here 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.590
 I have a lot of rain because I can 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.730
 have 80 gouges but this is because a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.920
 the carvers we like to have all the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.410
 gouges we like to have many mouths 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.170
 like but it is very difficult very difficult 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.040
 that we can take all the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.180
 gouges by carving a piece 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.250
 normally, it has its precedents 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.770
 your favorite your favorite ones that are 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.730
 those with which they are handled more more 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.040
 Every day you are between your flat 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.610
 half reeds your little gouges for 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 spades at best some knuckle in short 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.680
 to get some corner but 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.980
 normally not all the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.780
 gouges are used 15 20 30 gouges that 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.060
 they are the ones with you every day 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.920
 scrubbing but you do not need so many 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.080
 Gouge my father is fed up to say to me 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.550
 removes gouges from above the bench removes 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.230
 Gubia estimates that it is so overwhelming and 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.850
 is that I love having them 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.810
 love having them because I have gouges of 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.370
 my grandfather 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.270
 I have gouges from my parents I have other 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.530
 many who are shopping 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:44.850
 for now they are modern and I like and 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.910
 when I have them very worn and in 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.640
 order already out of the I have some of 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.060
 circulation because I feel embarrassed and finish 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.030
 I keep them because I never never 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.860
 I always throw away a gouge if it's not going to 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.320
 to shut up keeps it with much affection 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.340
 because these rains before and many 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:10.770
 things that I remember and and one always 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.380
 is attached to it let's say you and I 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.120
 I keep commenting but to the end in 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.700
 any hardware store is on the stones 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.190
 flat that serve to lay the edge 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.320
 to wear the gouge and then the 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.390
 hand stones that serves to return them 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240
 to frank mail of the various stones of 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.610
 hand is for example the found my 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.270
 father in the river 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.270
 these are modern stones you see that 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.180
 There are different according to the profile that 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.040
 have the stone then we can attach the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.280
 the mouth that has the gouge 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.820
 an oil 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.690
 here we have a grinder the grinder 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.540
 we should not use water and water 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.370
 they are good I never use it myself 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.100
 dwelling uses and a gouge is 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.470
 chipped a lot and has and has a 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.520
 very big media you are not going to throw all 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.590
 the days but you have to have a lot 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.680
 careful not to burn the gouge then 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.320
 you empty of water gives the grinder 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.120
 and little by little without getting to burn 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.580
 gouge because a gouge that has burned 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.920
 the edge is over the gouge will no longer cut 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.740
 never does it temper and no matter how much 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.070
 the rows at the moment you give them 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.470
 He gouges hatchet I just have 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.540
 rather because here he incorporated a 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.870
 coil a coil that normally of 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.840
 true to my friend marble workers with 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.640
 compact pool and marble and then 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.129
 then I will explain so that the machine 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.309
 I used 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.199
 well an oil we throw oil in the 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:44.389
 stones we already know we have stones 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:48.379
 more vast finer stones and the last 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.719
 fine stone and hand stones for 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:54.139
 return the edge the gouge consists of 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:56.839
 fist the cane the chamfer and the edge is worth 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.239
 these are the corners are the hawks 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:03.800
 of the gouge are the hawks the 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:07.249
 corners well then the first thing that 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.649
 makes is to make them chamfer 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:12.229
 to the gouge the chamfer to this then when 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:14.120
 the gouge is mediated or cuts us what 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.630
 first we have to do 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.720
 we accept this flash on the stone 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.510
 that only the chamfer seats, we give it the 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.870
 relevant slope and with a 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:30.920
 hand with the right for example move 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:34.310
 the gouge from side to side and with like and with 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.270
 the left we push following the 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.270
 mouth of the gouge 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.720
 and so on 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.340
 until we get the riva va that is the 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.220
 riva goes then once it has been done 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:55.050
 the new one is flat the gouge if 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.599
 we passed the see through the back 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.530
 we can feel like an upstairs villa a 

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:05.599
 up town like some teeth and llos 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.599
 well, those teeth and I the leftover
