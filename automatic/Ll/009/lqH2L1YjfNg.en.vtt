00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.509
 and those crazy spartans how 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.950
 you are I am in vÃ­ctor 63 and we are 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.240
 playing tehran a pretty game 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.370
 entertaining that will start within 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.050
 little because we are already 12 out of 12 assigns 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.480
 simply then upload this mode of 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.240
 I play because I did not go up 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.490
 not played, a lot of people played 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.310
 and the truth is that I wanted to play and 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.079
 I 'm good as I know it's fun and I know 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.839
 what do you like, then, and why do we 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.849
 there was a little bit to see how I do the 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.100
 Indian, here you have me doing the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.620
 Indian yes you should not run too much 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.900
 you have to go slowly in plan there is no 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.270
 hurry but it is that I sometimes put myself in 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.950
 nervous plan started and fast what 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.170
 it happens that there is one thing that I do not understand 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.100
 I understand that it makes no apparent sense 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.740
 like the garlic there is that for example yes 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.960
 if you are here a long time and then 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.960
 that is more us here 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.840
 no no no no no no no 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.560
 and if then you get tired of the next one but 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.799
 if here it is in a hole 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.799
 directly at the end 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.980
 so if for example you have the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.680
 first you can not fall at the end because 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.910
 sure there are no holes in the level 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 inferior but they are things of more category 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.360
 and many times people who go like me 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.390
 in plan, that is, but it is not like me 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.340
 I am quite this is this what I 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 I was telling you to shut up as I say two of 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.720
 good blow to said regional entity people 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.730
 that goes like this walking around the and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.560
 certainly not professional people fall 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.930
 authentically professional he played a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.860
 game before recording or I'll go to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.940
 To be honest 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 i 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.850
 that is 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 the people are pretty good I have to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.700
 learn from those people to play this mode 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.520
 of game because oysters hold 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.299
 very much talk a lot of many years 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.009
 something I wanted to tell in this video is 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.399
 such that in five years and I am one of 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.299
 they 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.299
 4 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.679
 3 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.200
 or 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.730
 let's go two first second I can stay 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.930
 first or second 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.930
 good game for the first 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.300
 i 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.710
 usual, come, come, come, come, come, me 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.420
 I think the first one first, we're going 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.420
 let's go let's go 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.050
 I can not comment on anything because this 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.050
 thing is super dodgy 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.049
 a future 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.990
 although what stress please come on let's go 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.440
 I do not have double jump 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.440
 go Go 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
 or 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.260
 no no no no you do not want radio you can only 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.750
 be good is the second I hope that you 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.500
 have liked this game is here 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.230
 spinning as always give him a good 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.410
 like your customers and the first time and 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 nothing comments and tell me if you simply like 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.810
 this game mode went to see if 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.130
 I say goodbye because it inhibits here 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.900
