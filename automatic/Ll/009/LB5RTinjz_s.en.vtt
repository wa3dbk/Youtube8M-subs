this is a sort of day where I accept I
expected<00:00:56.960> him<00:00:57.080> to<00:00:57.260> excel<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:58.210> started<00:00:59.210> when

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
expected him to excel that started when

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.020 
expected him to excel that started when
someone<00:00:59.510> made<00:01:00.200> a<00:01:00.460> dive-bomb<00:01:01.460> move<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
someone made a dive-bomb move to the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.030 
someone made a dive-bomb move to the
inside<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.720> right-hand<00:01:02.989> turn<00:01:03.380> one<00:01:03.620> there

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
inside of that right-hand turn one there

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.160 
inside of that right-hand turn one there
is<00:01:04.220> James<00:01:04.460> Jakes<00:01:04.880> his<00:01:05.120> car<00:01:05.360> stuffed<00:01:05.720> under<00:01:06.080> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
is James Jakes his car stuffed under the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.910 
is James Jakes his car stuffed under the

I<00:01:07.840> believe<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.470> car<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:09.860> made<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.250> move

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
I believe the car that made that move

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.700 
I believe the car that made that move
was<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.910> four<00:01:11.120> car<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.660> Stefano<00:01:12.110> Coletti<00:01:12.440> and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
was the four car of Stefano Coletti and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.520 
was the four car of Stefano Coletti and
the<00:01:13.250> result<00:01:13.550> in<00:01:13.700> all<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.910> jam<00:01:14.120> up<00:01:14.300> is<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:15.500> you

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
the result in all the jam up is what you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.590 
the result in all the jam up is what you
see<00:01:15.860> here<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.430> was<00:01:16.520> just<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.910> little<00:01:17.060> nudge

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
see here and it was just a little nudge

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.660 
see here and it was just a little nudge
but<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.960> track<00:01:18.200> being<00:01:18.410> wet<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.890> cars<00:01:19.130> lose<00:01:19.430> it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
but the track being wet the cars lose it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
but the track being wet the cars lose it
he<00:01:19.820> should<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.210> quickly<00:01:20.630> Tony<00:01:21.229> Kanaan<00:01:23.590> now

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
he should really quickly Tony Kanaan now

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.930 
he should really quickly Tony Kanaan now
his<00:01:24.800> mechanics<00:01:25.310> are<00:01:25.430> going<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.640> come<00:01:25.790> into

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
his mechanics are going to come into

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.990 
his mechanics are going to come into
play<00:01:26.200> as<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.380> tried<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.680> change<00:01:27.920> all<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.130> if

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
play as they tried to change all that if

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.969 
play as they tried to change all that if
three<00:01:29.240> wide<00:01:29.509> going<00:01:29.810> into<00:01:29.960> turn<00:01:30.229> one<00:01:30.440> is<00:01:30.590> always

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
three wide going into turn one is always

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.130 
three wide going into turn one is always
difficult<00:01:31.220> believe<00:01:31.700> it's<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.970> four<00:01:32.210> car<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
difficult believe it's the four car the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.840 
difficult believe it's the four car the
Stefano<00:01:33.530> Coletti<00:01:33.950> trying<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.460> get<00:01:34.610> on<00:01:34.729> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
Stefano Coletti trying to get on the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.639 
Stefano Coletti trying to get on the
inside<00:01:35.390> does<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.200> when<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.380> end<00:01:36.530> up

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
inside does that and when you end up

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.680 
inside does that and when you end up
hitting<00:01:36.860> contact<00:01:37.460> with<00:01:37.670> another<00:01:37.850> car<00:01:37.970> which

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
hitting contact with another car which

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.260 
hitting contact with another car which
is<00:01:38.869> James<00:01:39.170> Jake's<00:01:39.590> he<00:01:40.310> then<00:01:40.520> goes<00:01:40.759> ahead<00:01:40.970> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
is James Jake's he then goes ahead and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.880 
is James Jake's he then goes ahead and
starts<00:01:41.360> doing<00:01:41.780> almost<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.440> pinball

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
starts doing almost like a pinball

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.889 
starts doing almost like a pinball
movement<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.729> everybody<00:01:44.360> starts<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.750> get

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
movement and everybody starts to get

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.640 
movement and everybody starts to get
collected<00:01:47.049> now<00:01:48.049> we'll<00:01:48.200> have<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.409> see<00:01:48.560> if

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
collected now we'll have to see if

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.350 
collected now we'll have to see if
Jake's<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.250> out<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.670> tire<00:01:50.090> barrier

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
Jake's can get out of the tire barrier

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.080 
Jake's can get out of the tire barrier
and<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:51.080> clear<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:51.620> you<00:01:51.650> see<00:01:51.979> Graham<00:01:52.850> Rahal

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
and get clear but you see Graham Rahal

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.610 
and get clear but you see Graham Rahal
there<00:01:53.570> again

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
there again

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.530 
there again

like this here we got to go along with

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.600 
like this here we got to go along with
Graham<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.790> visibility<00:02:10.150> very<00:02:10.600> difficult

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
Graham see the visibility very difficult

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.800 
Graham see the visibility very difficult
and<00:02:12.610> grant<00:02:12.850> can't<00:02:13.150> see<00:02:13.360> he's<00:02:13.510> got<00:02:13.630> really
