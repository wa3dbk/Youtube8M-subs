we'll<00:01:04.320> talk<00:01:04.410> about<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> minute<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.040> then

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
the button i think is really really

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.230 
the button i think is really really
important<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> penalty<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
important because it's a penalty in the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
important because it's a penalty in the
game<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.409> goes<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
game if you don't have it it goes on the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.230 
game if you don't have it it goes on the
end<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> make<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.549> nobody<00:01:12.000> gets<00:01:12.090> hurt

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

stick so what i really like about about

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.429 
stick so what i really like about about
this<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.229> beginners<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.259> ball

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
this for beginners is that it the ball

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
this for beginners is that it the ball
comes<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> easily<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.430> catchable<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
comes in easily it's catchable but it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
comes in easily it's catchable but it
also<00:01:33.659> comes<00:01:33.899> out<00:01:34.049> easily<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.310> i<00:01:35.340> would

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
also comes out easily right so i would

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.109 
also comes out easily right so i would
really<00:01:35.909> recommend<00:01:37.100> 10<00:01:38.100> diamond<00:01:38.460> hard<00:01:38.790> mesh

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
really recommend 10 diamond hard mesh

really recommend 10 diamond hard mesh
for<00:01:39.600> beginners<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.250> could<00:01:41.369> also<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> soft

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
for beginners you could also go soft

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.050 
for beginners you could also go soft
mesh<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.229> personally<00:01:43.920> i<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.310> choose<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> 10

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
mesh but personally i would choose a 10

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
mesh but personally i would choose a 10
diamond<00:01:45.509> hard<00:01:46.020> mesh<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.920> beginners<00:01:47.509> right
