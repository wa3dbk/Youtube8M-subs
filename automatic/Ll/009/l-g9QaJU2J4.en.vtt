00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.590
 the baker will look forward to the round of weeks with mixed feelings 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.590
 andré kuipers the star player of the opponent 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.989
 forest 46 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.989
 first the beam that gets to the coops is it right 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.809
 kuipers has been injured for a long time 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.390
 and is now back 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.949
 after move fails to score in the first minutes of the game 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.310
 the postmen for the visitors i found us 46 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.699
 just yes the ball with an andré coopers 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 the severe knee injury behind it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.520
 completely missed last season 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.780
 operated on but he is completely back two goals away from his name 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.140
 so the home team zaandijk the champion backlog 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.450
 tim bakker is the big man for the buyers 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990
 he is for opposition 2 ing 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.660
 nothing wrong 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.890
 decked out comes well off the starting blocks and started to self-confidence 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.750
 play 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 jan de kleijn 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 German club 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.880
 dos 46 a head start 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.850
 two points 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.479
 For Dost and the other competitors, a tailor-made solution is sought 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.390
 combination of koog zaandijk in the last season namely 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.350
 train more 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 make intensive hours on the training fields 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.190
 like you 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.020
 from a distance 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 I know the difference 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.650
 gent can put at least opposite 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 eric de vries 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 the boy tim bakker 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 the ball of most goals rinus bakker 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.130
 good rebound from erik de vries 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 an attempt by eliza vennema too 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 wrong and it can be the big band that falls on us 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.330
 and they can continue to build 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 a headstart 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 Russia 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.730
 andré kuipers the voice of two years ago 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.380
 I think they will now also be horrified in this competition 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.279
 home crowd 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 never press the leader with the champion team 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.739
 forests of capes 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.399
 team cocu the authors 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 she came from blue white 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 again blows nicely shot out of the rubble 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.889
 for dos 46 still 11 8 is the position 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.569
 rather small 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.569
 every customer of peter lageweg 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.749
 washington photos 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.589
 4 because from the road 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.649
 a reporter of himself 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.849
 this post that does not happen in acquiescence 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.450
 the booth is still 8 11 and I am working on the store so in the wind 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.689
 peace 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.789
 martijn roos who are coming marathon flight is kuipers too fast 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.659
 but he doesn't score 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.029
 and that remains the problem 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.319
 Koog Zaandijk had a low shot percentage in this competition 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.129
 doutzen the tie because here is casper boom 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.230
 well that can be seen during the game he was mainly defensive 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.139
 he does track in the final phase of the match 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.139
 because dos does not relinquish the lead 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.119
 they have to face the entire competition 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.779
 nice blocks of casper tree and then the freeze 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:37.829
 bad luck for koog zaandijk 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.299
 you see 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 the disappointment on the faces despondent 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.950
 four points is the lead for dost it is 21 17 there is in the last minute 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.949
 andré kuipers makes his eighth match 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.309
 he is celebrating his comeback has ended with winning a suitcase at this championship 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.010
 season the defending champion 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.499
 koog zaandijk 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.460
 owner victims 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.079
 22 18 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.079
 the first points of the season are friends for dos 46 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:07.749
 the champion
