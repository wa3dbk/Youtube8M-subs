00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850 
already know I did buy this oculus rift
thing<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.240> I'm<00:00:09.480> currently<00:00:09.780> inside<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.559> game

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
thing and I'm currently inside a game

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.610 
thing and I'm currently inside a game
and<00:00:11.190> districts<00:00:12.179> absolutely<00:00:12.780> insane<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:13.530> as

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and districts absolutely insane so as

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.140 
and districts absolutely insane so as
you<00:00:13.710> guys<00:00:13.769> can<00:00:13.889> see<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.099> am<00:00:14.400> inside<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.880> some

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
you guys can see I am inside of some

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.790 
you guys can see I am inside of some
sort<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.420> arena<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.080> I'm<00:00:16.230> guessing<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.680> my

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
sort of arena and I'm guessing that my

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
sort of arena and I'm guessing that my
mission<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> take<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.550> bike<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.060> drive

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
mission is to take this bike and drive

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
mission is to take this bike and drive
off<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.260> jump<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> make<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> jump<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.119> guess

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
off that jump and make a jump so I guess

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.210 
off that jump and make a jump so I guess
let's<00:00:21.869> try<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.470> stunting<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.039> with

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
let's try to do some stunting it with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.320
