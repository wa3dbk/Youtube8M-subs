rate<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.700> mini<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> faster

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
rate as the mini me but it has a faster

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.580 
rate as the mini me but it has a faster
firing<00:01:58.710> rate<00:01:59.070> than<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> m16a3<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.990> mg3

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
firing rate than the m16a3 the mg3

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.289 
firing rate than the m16a3 the mg3
actually<00:02:01.920> has<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> fastest<00:02:02.670> reload<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> all

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
actually has the fastest reload of all

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.780 
actually has the fastest reload of all
three<00:02:03.600> while<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> mini<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.950> slowest<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
three while the mini me is slowest and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
three while the mini me is slowest and
I'll<00:02:05.880> replay<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.210> again<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.570> slow<00:02:06.600> motion<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I'll replay it again in slow motion so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.450 
I'll replay it again in slow motion so
that<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.740> see<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> difference

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:24.830 

you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.860 

and<00:02:24.930> then<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.890> mg3<00:02:26.580> has<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> fastest<00:02:27.540> draw

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and then the mg3 has the fastest draw

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
and then the mg3 has the fastest draw
speed<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> Colt<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.129> 16<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.120> 3<00:02:30.450> coming<00:02:30.810> in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
speed with the Colt and 16 a 3 coming in

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
speed with the Colt and 16 a 3 coming in
last<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.620> I'll<00:02:31.709> replayed<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.160> again<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.459> slow

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
last and I'll replayed it again in slow

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.920 
last and I'll replayed it again in slow
motion<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.599> see<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
motion so that you can see the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.290 
motion so that you can see the
difference<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.180> own

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
difference and then now for my own

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.059 
difference and then now for my own
opinion<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.840> guns<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.590> honest<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
opinion at the guns to be honest out of

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.729 
opinion at the guns to be honest out of
all<00:02:38.400> three<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.849> personally<00:02:39.480> prefer<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.959> mg3

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
all three I personally prefer the mg3

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.020 
all three I personally prefer the mg3
out<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.069> all<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.220> them<00:02:41.400> there's<00:02:41.640> not<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.819> great

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
out of all of them there's not a great

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
out of all of them there's not a great
difference<00:02:42.420> between<00:02:43.080> any<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.410> them<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
difference between any of them but I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.910 
difference between any of them but I
just<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.390> way<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.660> looks<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.890> looks

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
just like the way it looks like it looks

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
just like the way it looks like it looks
like<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> real<00:02:47.730> gun<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.900> full<00:02:49.140> deal

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
like a real gun you get the full deal

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.850 
like a real gun you get the full deal
with<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.040> such<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.330> actual<00:02:51.860> liquid

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
with it as such but the actual liquid

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.440 
with it as such but the actual liquid
metal<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.489> currently<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.879> only<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.269> that's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
metal is currently the only one that's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.360 
metal is currently the only one that's
available<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.230> as<00:02:55.379> they're<00:02:55.830> pretty<00:02:56.040> much<00:02:56.099> all

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
available but as they're pretty much all

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.770 
available but as they're pretty much all
the<00:02:56.549> same<00:02:56.580> there's<00:02:57.000> no<00:02:57.180> real<00:02:57.450> difference

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the same there's no real difference

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.199 
the same there's no real difference
between<00:02:58.470> any<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.739> them<00:02:59.010> other<00:02:59.220> than<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.849> ammo

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
between any of them other than the ammo

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.229 
between any of them other than the ammo
and<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.290> skin<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:02.010> gold<00:03:02.310> doesn't<00:03:02.880> look<00:03:03.209> that

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and the skin the gold doesn't look that

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.449 
and the skin the gold doesn't look that
great<00:03:03.660> personally<00:03:04.440> there's<00:03:04.920> no<00:03:05.069> shine

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
great personally there's no shine

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.530 
great personally there's no shine
there's<00:03:05.790> no<00:03:05.940> glint<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.290> as<00:03:07.440> such<00:03:07.680> which<00:03:08.099> is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
there's no glint to it as such which is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.630 
there's no glint to it as such which is
kind<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.629> surprising<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> gold<00:03:10.829> gun<00:03:11.099> that's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
kind of surprising for a gold gun that's

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.100 
kind of surprising for a gold gun that's
not<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.540> old<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.319> be<00:03:13.440> honest<00:03:14.420> either<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.660> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
not that old to be honest either way the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.080 
not that old to be honest either way the
mg3<00:03:16.709> standard<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.459> personally<00:03:17.910> my<00:03:18.060> favorite

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
mg3 standard is personally my favorite

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.150 
mg3 standard is personally my favorite
but<00:03:18.660> as<00:03:20.209> mgs<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.510> they<00:03:21.660> are<00:03:21.840> great<00:03:22.379> they<00:03:22.950> have

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
but as mgs that they are great they have

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.339 
but as mgs that they are great they have
great<00:03:23.370> firing<00:03:24.030> rate<00:03:24.239> good<00:03:24.930> ammo<00:03:25.579> great<00:03:26.579> power

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
great firing rate good ammo great power

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.680 
great firing rate good ammo great power
good<00:03:28.349> that<00:03:29.130> they<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> fairly<00:03:29.819> tight<00:03:30.150> spray

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
good that they have a fairly tight spray

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.140 
good that they have a fairly tight spray
pattern<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.680> an<00:03:31.769> mg<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.160> course<00:03:32.519> but<00:03:32.850> it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
pattern for an mg of course but it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.289 
pattern for an mg of course but it's
when<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> start<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.200> compare<00:03:34.530> them<00:03:34.709> against

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
when you start to compare them against

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.020 
when you start to compare them against
say<00:03:36.299> an<00:03:36.660> assault<00:03:37.049> rifle<00:03:37.109> like<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.889> AK<00:03:38.370> or<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
say an assault rifle like the AK or the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.039 
say an assault rifle like the AK or the
m4<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.139> kind<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.739> starts<00:03:41.389> not<00:03:42.389> working<00:03:42.900> as

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
m4 that it kind of starts not working as

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.330 
m4 that it kind of starts not working as
good<00:03:43.380> sure<00:03:44.250> their<00:03:44.579> power<00:03:44.790> matches<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
good sure their power matches to and

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.949 
good sure their power matches to and
most<00:03:47.340> other<00:03:47.609> assault<00:03:48.030> rifles<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
most other assault rifles but it's the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.259 
most other assault rifles but it's the
fact<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.260> spray<00:03:49.799> pattern<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.370> comparison<00:03:51.120> is

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
fact that spray pattern in comparison is

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.800 
fact that spray pattern in comparison is
so<00:03:51.900> much<00:03:52.139> larger<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:53.730> literally<00:03:54.150> spray

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
so much larger you can literally spray

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530 
so much larger you can literally spray
for<00:03:55.260> hours<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.739> end<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:57.120> may<00:03:57.329> not<00:03:57.480> even

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
for hours on end and you may not even

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.050 
for hours on end and you may not even
hit<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> person<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:58.859> it<00:03:59.010> will<00:03:59.190> go<00:03:59.370> nowhere

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
hit a person because it will go nowhere

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.180 
hit a person because it will go nowhere
near<00:04:00.540> where<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.870> want<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.440> which<00:04:02.040> is

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
near where you want it to which is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.930 
near where you want it to which is
completely<00:04:02.340> expected<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:03.569> an<00:04:03.750> mg<00:04:04.819> but<00:04:05.819> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
completely expected it is an mg but the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.059 
completely expected it is an mg but the
actual<00:04:06.299> accuracy<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.019> gun<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.440> really

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
actual accuracy of the gun is really

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.180 
actual accuracy of the gun is really
good<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.609> can<00:04:09.150> shoot<00:04:09.540> em<00:04:09.810> up<00:04:10.620> people<00:04:11.010> for

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
good you can shoot em up people for

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.900 
good you can shoot em up people for
miles<00:04:11.880> away<00:04:12.889> all<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.160> time<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.609> these<00:04:14.700> guns

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
miles away all the time with these guns

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.599 
miles away all the time with these guns
because<00:04:15.209> they're<00:04:16.139> just<00:04:16.380> one<00:04:16.739> really<00:04:17.250> powerful

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
because they're just one really powerful

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.210 
because they're just one really powerful
to<00:04:17.820> really<00:04:18.120> accurate<00:04:18.539> so<00:04:18.810> yeah<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:20.099> actual

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
to really accurate so yeah the actual

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.940 
to really accurate so yeah the actual
reload<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.150> nice<00:04:21.479> it's<00:04:21.840> nice<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.229> fast<00:04:22.530> you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
reload is nice it's nice and fast you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.070 
reload is nice it's nice and fast you
can<00:04:23.190> keep<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.639> well<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.479> you<00:04:24.570> can't<00:04:24.780> keep<00:04:24.960> on

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
can keep on well then you can't keep on

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.260 
can keep on well then you can't keep on
but<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.320> can<00:04:25.470> reload<00:04:25.889> from<00:04:26.190> one<00:04:26.430> magazine<00:04:26.820> to
