00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.040
 so if I had to define this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.980
 training I would define it in a nutshell 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.890
 for me it is excellence in the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 the title of this formation created and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.680
 directed his restaurant tutti is there in 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.470
 the dna of our school there is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.829
 entrepreneurship and creativity 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.159
 the founder paul bocuse the president 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.610
 since 1998 gerard pelisson are two 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.339
 examples that have each undertaken to their 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.549
 way but with the same the same 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.549
 values 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.360
 so my project is to open a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.910
 restaurant in the spirit the kitchen of the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.130
 Lyonnaise mothers and the cooking spirit of 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.950
 family so the goal is to open a 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.460
 restaurant on lyon by end of october 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.549
 with 5 gourmet shots 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.530
 on the gluten free and with a 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.780
 very limited allergen makes you feel good 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.600
 flat and we pay attention sir no 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.610
 too much his cream think of that is first 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.950
 in the missions of the chamber of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.770
 trade to accompany the carriers of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.380
 projects and in this mission we have 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.770
 developed over the years 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.960
 training of excellence where we ensure 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.479
 our participants a training that the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.649
 pay them to create in 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.580
 good conditions and especially of 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.080
 sustain their business for them 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.550
 to achieve what is called excellence 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.769
 entrepreneurial is where we can 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.500
 to be we get out we will be we get closer 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.330
 the most with the institute paul bocuse 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.630
 it is that we are both aiming for a form 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.630
 excellence 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.390
 I was stylet integrated training 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.530
 credit relay his restaurant to 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.630
 the institute paul bocuse 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.860
 because I was looking for excellence and I 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 especially looking for a program that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.650
 allows both to combine theory and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.209
 practical on a fairly short format and the 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.130
 program over two months so ten 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.780
 weeks corresponded entirely to this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.239
 that I was waiting for since there is some 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.720
 really theoretical and a very part 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.569
 convenient 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.760
 which will allow later and two to 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.980
 both to have the theoretical side of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.830
 all that is legal and social 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.670
 management thus yielded the fundamentals of the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.170
 running a business 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.200
 and yes also the kitchen part 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.660
 since not coming from a formation 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.610
 of restoration it seemed to me very 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.769
 important to have a training 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.790
 of excellence on the kitchen and 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.819
 that's why I was looking for 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.060
 a very practical part in the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.060
 training 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.600
 my professional background until 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.180
 day was not at all in the field 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.760
 of the restoration of the kitchen 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.650
 what I was working on so far and 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.250
 for ten years in the development of the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.230
 territory the difference between between the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.609
 reconversion training proposed by 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.920
 institute paul bocuse and then others 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.500
 retraining formations that I could 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.900
 to see elsewhere is really this aspect 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.980
 both management management and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.470
 culinary techniques 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.510
 it's a specificity of this training 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.120
 that I go find elsewhere from 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.120
 overall way I would say 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.860
 why then hygiene or you 

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.479
 representing hygiene leaping from 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.729
 rules and practices relating to 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.169
 health preservation here and so 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.969
 the pms the sanitary master plan 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.110
 food that you have to put in 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.899
 place in all of your 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.849
 institutions takes over the entire 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:00.489
 these good practices and I think that's 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:05.499
 program in 10 weeks gave them 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:08.019
 the fundamentals and I believe that at the 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:11.969
 times the managerial approach and the 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:16.689
 practical approaches have created 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:19.360
 this beautiful construction that characterizes 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.809
 a graduate of our school a graduate of 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.869
 our school 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:25.179
 he is attached to the tradition he is 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:28.809
 very open to modernity through the 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:30.669
 management he undertakes and there is this 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:35.049
 I call attention to detail 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.239
 because in our trades think of 

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:40.179
 little things that 's not thinking small 

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:43.539
 it's this succession of details that 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:43.959
 in turn, a house has a 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.169
 soul 

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:50.579
 we feel good and we want to say 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.579
 come we want to talk about it
