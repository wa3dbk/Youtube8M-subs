now<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.939> can<00:00:03.090> make<00:00:03.240> things<00:00:03.480> even<00:00:03.689> more<00:00:03.959> complex

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
now we can make things even more complex

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.200 
now we can make things even more complex
we<00:00:04.859> can<00:00:04.890> ask<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.339> question<00:00:05.819> what<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
we can ask the question what the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.770 
we can ask the question what the
probabilities<00:00:06.839> are<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> week<00:00:07.379> from<00:00:07.649> today

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780

given<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.929> today<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.500> sunny<00:00:10.940> well<00:00:11.940> we're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
given that today it is sunny well we're

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.669 
given that today it is sunny well we're
not<00:00:12.330> gonna<00:00:12.509> answer<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.019> right<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.440> because

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
not gonna answer this right now because

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.200 
not gonna answer this right now because
what<00:00:13.950> we're<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.400> do<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> we're<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:14.969> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.370 
what we're going to do is we're going to
program<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> minute<00:00:18.020> to<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.170> so

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
program this up in a minute to do so

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.450 
program this up in a minute to do so
though<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.740> need<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.010> introduce<00:00:20.250> some

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
though we need to introduce some

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.890 
though we need to introduce some
notation<00:00:22.430> we're<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> say<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.269> Chi<00:00:24.539> sub

and Chi sub 2 K but it's kind of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.440 
and Chi sub 2 K but it's kind of
convenient<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.190> SC<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.520> R<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.210> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
convenient to use SC and R so that we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.290 
convenient to use SC and R so that we
know<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.840> sunny<00:00:49.140> cloudy<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:50.280> rainy<00:00:53.210> ok<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
know it's sunny cloudy or rainy ok so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.709 
know it's sunny cloudy or rainy ok so

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
of linear equations and then we can say

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.160 
of linear equations and then we can say
okay<00:02:18.370> well<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.820> call<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.390> matrix<00:02:19.810> P

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
okay well we can call this matrix P

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350 
okay well we can call this matrix P
that's<00:02:20.830> known<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> transition<00:02:21.940> matrix

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
that's known as the transition matrix

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.250 
that's known as the transition matrix
and<00:02:22.630> we<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.380> call<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.640> vector<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.720> tells<00:02:26.020> us

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
and we can call the vector that tells us

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.980 
and we can call the vector that tells us
what<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> state<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.400> day<00:02:27.760> K<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.690> state

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
what the state is on day K the state

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.750 
what the state is on day K the state
vector<00:02:29.500> X<00:02:30.000> super<00:02:31.000> K<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> we<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.280> notion<00:02:33.550> of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
vector X super K so we have a notion of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.310 
vector X super K so we have a notion of
a<00:02:33.880> state<00:02:34.120> vector<00:02:34.570> X<00:02:34.780> Super<00:02:35.650> K<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.840> state<00:02:38.140> on

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
a state vector X Super K the state on

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.220 
a state vector X Super K the state on
day<00:02:38.590> K<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.550> transition<00:02:40.150> matrix<00:02:40.570> P<00:02:43.230> so

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
day K and the transition matrix P so

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.720 
day K and the transition matrix P so
what<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:44.590> notice<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.190> matrix<00:02:45.490> vector

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
what we notice is that matrix vector

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.720 
what we notice is that matrix vector
multiplication<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.630> now<00:02:46.780> used<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.230> complex

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
linear equations so here we have a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.860 
linear equations so here we have a
vector<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.010> tells<00:02:54.730> us<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.120> probability<00:02:55.150> is

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
vector that tells us the probability is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.690

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.220 
that today it is sunny cloudy or rainy
well<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:00.850> can<00:03:01.000> look<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.330> window<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.020> see

well we can look out the window and see

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.810 
well we can look out the window and see
what<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.680> let's<00:03:03.040> say<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.670> is

tomorrow given that today it is cloudy
well<00:03:28.720> that's<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.320> matter<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.650> doing<00:03:30.010> this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
well that's a matter of doing this

matrix times vector multiply and if we
plug-in<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.390> today<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.050> is<00:03:35.170> cloudy<00:03:35.880> then

plug-in that today it is cloudy then

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.570 
plug-in that today it is cloudy then
what<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.270> get<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.890> multiplication

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
what we get is just this multiplication

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.570 
what we get is just this multiplication
but<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:40.690> should<00:03:41.080> have<00:03:41.230> simply<00:03:41.680> said<00:03:41.980> oh<00:03:42.130> we

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
but we should have simply said oh we

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.310 
but we should have simply said oh we
know<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.970> when<00:03:43.120> we<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.810> matrix<00:03:43.989> vector

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320

multiplication with a unit basis vector

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.290 
multiplication with a unit basis vector
we'd<00:03:47.080> simply<00:03:47.380> pick<00:03:47.860> out<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.670> appropriate

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
we'd simply pick out the appropriate

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.990 
we'd simply pick out the appropriate
column<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.350> there<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.250> have<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.700> we

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
column and there you have it so we

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.140

out the appropriate column if we want

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.690 
out the appropriate column if we want

we<00:04:09.520> need<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.820> do<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.209> take<00:04:10.390> our<00:04:10.600> transition

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
we need to do is take our transition

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.970 
we need to do is take our transition
matrix<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.890> multiply<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.700> times<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.980> vector

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
tomorrow we just calculated what that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.490 
tomorrow we just calculated what that
was<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.400> when<00:04:21.400> we<00:04:21.549> multiply<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:22.210> out<00:04:22.360> we<00:04:23.289> get

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
was and when we multiply that out we get

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.590 
was and when we multiply that out we get
the<00:04:23.740> vector<00:04:24.100> of<00:04:24.130> probabilities<00:04:24.490> for<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.450> day

the vector of probabilities for the day
after<00:04:25.960> tomorrow<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:26.500> notice<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.130> a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
after tomorrow and notice that this is a

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.690 
after tomorrow and notice that this is a
lot

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
lot

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.630 
lot
easier<00:04:28.120> than<00:04:28.840> writing<00:04:29.650> out<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.340> tree<00:04:30.610> that

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
easier than writing out that tree that

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.720 
easier than writing out that tree that
we<00:04:30.940> would<00:04:31.180> have<00:04:31.270> had<00:04:31.390> to<00:04:31.510> write<00:04:31.690> out<00:04:31.900> otherwise

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
we would have had to write out otherwise

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.130 
we would have had to write out otherwise
what<00:04:33.730> now<00:04:33.940> if<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.270> want<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.540> know<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:35.020> the

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
what now if we want to know what the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.050 
what now if we want to know what the
probabilities<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:35.830> for<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.310> week<00:04:36.520> from<00:04:36.850> now

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
probabilities are for a week from now

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.330 
probabilities are for a week from now
given<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.810> today<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:38.380> sunny<00:04:38.620> cloudy<00:04:39.130> or

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
given that today it's sunny cloudy or

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.450 
given that today it's sunny cloudy or
rainy<00:04:39.960> well<00:04:40.960> we've<00:04:41.170> we<00:04:41.710> know<00:04:41.860> how<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.070> do<00:04:42.280> that

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
rainy well we've we know how to do that

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.070 
rainy well we've we know how to do that
now<00:04:42.640> that's<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.030> matter<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.300> doing<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.750> bunch<00:04:43.960> of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
now that's a matter of doing a bunch of

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.750 
now that's a matter of doing a bunch of
matrix<00:04:44.440> vector<00:04:44.590> multiplies<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:48.400> it's<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.640> lot

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
matrix vector multiplies but it's a lot

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.790 
matrix vector multiplies but it's a lot
easier<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.240> we<00:04:49.630> use<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.990> computer<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.530> do<00:04:50.650> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
easier if we use the computer to do the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.160 
easier if we use the computer to do the
heavy<00:04:50.950> lifting<00:04:51.460> for<00:04:51.490> us<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.480> I<00:04:52.510> want<00:04:52.750> you<00:04:53.110> to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
heavy lifting for us so I want you to

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.790 
heavy lifting for us so I want you to
now<00:04:53.380> go<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.650> open<00:04:54.250> up<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.610> Python<00:04:55.030> notebook

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
now go and open up the Python notebook

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.870 
now go and open up the Python notebook
predicting<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.890> weather<00:04:56.920> for<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.430> next<00:04:57.460> week

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
predicting the weather for the next week

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.860 
predicting the weather for the next week
and<00:04:58.120> I'll<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.170> in<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.350> next<00:04:59.590> video
