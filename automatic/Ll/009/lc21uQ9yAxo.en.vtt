you before I give this to a friend I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.119 
you before I give this to a friend I
need<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> replace<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> blade<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> thought<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
need to replace the blade so I thought I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.670 
need to replace the blade so I thought I
would<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.030> well<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.930> once<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
would show you that as well so once it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.279 
would show you that as well so once it
starts<00:00:43.980> getting<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.670> ragged<00:00:45.539> when

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
starts getting a little bit ragged when

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
starts getting a little bit ragged when
you<00:00:46.410> cut<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.309> time<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> replace

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you cut it you know it's time to replace

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.880 
you cut it you know it's time to replace
eclis<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.140> easy<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> do

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
eclis that's very easy to do

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
eclis that's very easy to do
I<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.430> well<00:00:50.789> enough<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:51.989> not

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I like this well enough but if I'm not

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
I like this well enough but if I'm not
paying<00:00:52.469> close<00:00:52.530> enough<00:00:52.890> attention<00:00:53.149> sometimes

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
paying close enough attention sometimes

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029

this feature you can see here there's a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
this feature you can see here there's a
little<00:01:38.790> wire<00:01:39.090> showing<00:01:40.020> exactly<00:01:40.530> where<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
little wire showing exactly where the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
little wire showing exactly where the
cut<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.320> cutting

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590

a<00:02:16.569> little<00:02:16.900> kind<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.319> knotch<00:02:17.709> at<00:02:18.129> very<00:02:18.639> end<00:02:18.760> and

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
a little kind of knotch at very end and

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.239 
a little kind of knotch at very end and
you<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.689> slide<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.079> to<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.349> knotch<00:02:20.590> it'll

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
you just slide it to that knotch it'll

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.099 
you just slide it to that knotch it'll
pull<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:21.670> off<00:02:21.879> and<00:02:22.209> see<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.569> got<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.870> lot<00:02:23.049> of

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
pull right off and see this got a lot of

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.229 
pull right off and see this got a lot of
use<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.709> cutting<00:02:23.980> nicely<00:02:24.459> when<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:25.090> was

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
use it's so cutting nicely when it was

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.149 
use it's so cutting nicely when it was
not<00:02:25.569> cutting<00:02:25.930> all<00:02:26.079> that<00:02:26.109> well<00:02:26.439> I<00:02:26.709> just<00:02:26.799> take<00:02:27.129> it

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
not cutting all that well I just take it

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.490 
not cutting all that well I just take it
out<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.819> turn<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.329> around<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.109> I'm

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
out and turn it around so that I'm

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.869 
out and turn it around so that I'm
cutting<00:02:29.769> with<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> other<00:02:30.250> side<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.730> blade

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
cutting with the other side of the blade

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.300 
cutting with the other side of the blade
it<00:02:31.180> does<00:02:31.389> cut<00:02:31.780> in<00:02:31.900> both<00:02:32.079> directions<00:02:32.469> that<00:02:33.219> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
it does cut in both directions that I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.640 
it does cut in both directions that I
usually<00:02:33.489> cut<00:02:33.909> up<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.540> way<00:02:34.750> all<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.109> time<00:02:35.319> so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
usually cut up this way all the time so

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.559 
usually cut up this way all the time so
then<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.099> turn<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.549> around<00:02:36.639> or<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.209> can<00:02:37.540> just

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
then I just turn it around or I can just

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.690 
then I just turn it around or I can just
cut<00:02:37.959> this<00:02:38.139> direction<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:39.040> what<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
cut this direction that is what I like

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.659 
cut this direction that is what I like
so<00:02:39.730> much<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.419> was<00:02:40.719> probably<00:02:41.159> maybe<00:02:42.159> twenty

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:42.669 
so much this was probably maybe twenty

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.420 
so much this was probably maybe twenty
dollars<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.569> was<00:02:43.780> maybe<00:02:43.989> twelve<00:02:44.620> twelve

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
dollars and this was maybe twelve twelve

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.309 
dollars and this was maybe twelve twelve
or<00:02:45.549> thirteen<00:02:45.939> dollars<00:02:46.389> and<00:02:46.599> I<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:47.079> for<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
or thirteen dollars and I think for the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.470 
or thirteen dollars and I think for the
extra<00:02:47.769> seven<00:02:48.489> dollars<00:02:48.879> you're<00:02:49.239> going<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.419> be

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
extra seven dollars you're going to be

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.059 
extra seven dollars you're going to be
really<00:02:49.750> happy<00:02:50.139> that<00:02:50.500> you've<00:02:50.650> got<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.919> one

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
really happy that you've got the one

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.679 
really happy that you've got the one
with<00:02:51.219> the<00:02:51.310> wire<00:02:51.489> even<00:02:52.150> though<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.389> takes

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
with the wire even though this takes

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.869 
with the wire even though this takes
more<00:02:52.930> space<00:02:53.109> it's<00:02:53.859> super<00:02:54.250> skinny<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.699> can

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
more space it's super skinny you can

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.659 
more space it's super skinny you can
slide<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.569> sideways<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.469> any<00:02:56.650> shelf<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.579> an

awkward shape but it's very skinny you
can<00:02:59.919> slide<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.310> alongside<00:03:00.790> your<00:03:01.239> computer

these<00:03:07.930> were<00:03:08.049> $8.99<00:03:08.769> at<00:03:08.949> Hobby<00:03:09.159> Lobby<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:09.909> of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
these were $8.99 at Hobby Lobby but of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.750 
these were $8.99 at Hobby Lobby but of
course<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.599> 40%<00:03:11.290> coupon<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:12.459> was<00:03:12.609> probably

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
course a 40% coupon so it was probably

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.459 
course a 40% coupon so it was probably
around<00:03:13.060> five<00:03:13.359> or<00:03:13.510> six<00:03:13.689> dollars<00:03:13.900> these<00:03:14.409> are

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
around five or six dollars these are

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.530 
around five or six dollars these are
titanium<00:03:14.949> I<00:03:15.549> thought<00:03:15.849> I'd<00:03:15.970> give<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.299> try

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
titanium I thought I'd give it a try

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.189 
titanium I thought I'd give it a try
with<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.560> 40%<00:03:18.129> off<00:03:18.609> only<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> dollar<00:03:19.359> more<00:03:19.780> so

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
with the 40% off only a dollar more so

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.939 
with the 40% off only a dollar more so
then<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.979> 599<00:03:21.790> regular<00:03:22.329> Fiskars<00:03:23.019> replacement

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
then the 599 regular Fiskars replacement

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:24.360 
then the 599 regular Fiskars replacement
blades

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
blades

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
blades
it<00:03:24.669> says<00:03:24.909> style<00:03:25.239> one<00:03:25.540> I'm<00:03:26.049> going<00:03:26.169> to<00:03:26.259> take<00:03:26.409> this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it says style one I'm going to take this

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.509 
it says style one I'm going to take this
out<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.159> then<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.329> just<00:03:28.629> take<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:30.370> this

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
out and then you just take this see this

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.210 
out and then you just take this see this
little<00:03:30.729> notch<00:03:31.000> here<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:32.349> just<00:03:32.530> drop<00:03:33.069> it<00:03:33.189> right

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
little notch here you just drop it right

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.330 
little notch here you just drop it right
in<00:03:33.549> there<00:03:33.729> and<00:03:33.939> then<00:03:34.629> it's<00:03:35.109> locked<00:03:35.379> on<00:03:35.590> so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
in there and then it's locked on so

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.249 
in there and then it's locked on so
let's<00:03:36.549> see<00:03:36.729> how<00:03:36.879> that<00:03:36.909> works<00:03:37.209> let's<00:03:37.959> see<00:03:38.079> if<00:03:38.169> it

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:38.259 
let's see how that works let's see if it

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.530 
let's see how that works let's see if it
looks<00:03:38.379> different

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
looks different

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.939 
looks different
titanium<00:03:40.540> it's<00:03:40.959> probably<00:03:41.290> exactly<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.769> same

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
titanium it's probably exactly the same

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:42.960 
titanium it's probably exactly the same
thing<00:03:42.220> as<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.489> other<00:03:42.639> ones

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
thing as the other ones

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.289 
thing as the other ones
okay<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:43.900> let's<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.889> same<00:03:45.129> thing<00:03:45.370> for<00:03:45.609> here<00:03:45.819> it

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
okay so let's the same thing for here it

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.280 
okay so let's the same thing for here it
says<00:03:47.259> that<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:48.699> works<00:03:48.909> on<00:03:49.060> any<00:03:49.299> triple<00:03:49.840> track

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
says that it works on any triple track

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.309 
says that it works on any triple track
okay<00:03:51.040> so<00:03:51.099> let's<00:03:51.430> see<00:03:51.609> if<00:03:51.669> it<00:03:51.759> works<00:03:51.939> better<00:03:52.319> at

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
okay so let's see if it works better at

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.990 
okay so let's see if it works better at
four<00:03:53.769> by<00:03:53.949> six<00:03:54.250> line<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.209> up<00:03:55.299> like<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.569> I<00:04:00.000> just

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
four by six line it up like that I just

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.839 
four by six line it up like that I just
posed<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.449> sharper<00:04:01.810> cut<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.430> let's<00:04:03.639> do

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
posed it's a sharper cut so let's do

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.899 
posed it's a sharper cut so let's do
these<00:04:04.259> let's<00:04:05.259> try<00:04:05.409> this<00:04:05.469> one<00:04:05.769> by<00:04:06.370> cutting<00:04:06.699> it

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
these let's try this one by cutting it

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.309 
these let's try this one by cutting it
into<00:04:07.120> three<00:04:07.569> by<00:04:07.719> four<00:04:09.780> see<00:04:10.780> if<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:10.959> wanted<00:04:11.199> to

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
into three by four see if I wanted to

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.170 
into three by four see if I wanted to
just<00:04:11.500> type<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.859> four<00:04:12.250> inches<00:04:12.519> long<00:04:12.729> I'd<00:04:13.000> have

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
just type this four inches long I'd have

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.680 
just type this four inches long I'd have
to<00:04:13.269> pull<00:04:13.479> this<00:04:13.569> dumb<00:04:13.900> thing<00:04:13.930> out<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.879> mean

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
to pull this dumb thing out so I mean

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.050 
to pull this dumb thing out so I mean
four<00:04:16.959> inches<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.680> think<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.519> wouldn't<00:04:18.760> have<00:04:18.909> to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
four inches I think you wouldn't have to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.509 
four inches I think you wouldn't have to
do<00:04:19.180> that

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
do that

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.150 
do that
four<00:04:19.789> inches<00:04:20.120> yeah<00:04:21.109> that's<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.709> much<00:04:21.889> better

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
four inches yeah that's a much better

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.339 
four inches yeah that's a much better
it's<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.610> nice<00:04:22.789> sharp<00:04:23.150> cut<00:04:23.449> it's<00:04:23.810> almost<00:04:24.110> like

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
it's a nice sharp cut it's almost like

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.510 
it's a nice sharp cut it's almost like
like<00:04:24.949> it<00:04:25.069> was<00:04:25.099> the<00:04:25.400> original<00:04:25.880> straight<00:04:26.720> edge

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
like it was the original straight edge

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.180 
like it was the original straight edge
hex<00:04:28.520> huh<00:04:29.139> here's<00:04:30.139> another<00:04:30.380> great<00:04:30.830> thing<00:04:31.039> about

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
hex huh here's another great thing about

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.760 
hex huh here's another great thing about
this<00:04:31.460> little<00:04:31.699> wire<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.870> like<00:04:33.080> even<00:04:33.500> if<00:04:33.590> you're

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
this little wire is like even if you're

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.620 
this little wire is like even if you're
if<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.250> want<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.490> go<00:04:34.580> straight<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:35.000> can<00:04:35.210> let's

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
if you want to go straight you can let's

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:45.010 
if you want to go straight you can let's
do<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:42.039> but<00:04:43.039> let's<00:04:43.940> say<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.419> want<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.690> cut<00:04:44.870> it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
do that but let's say you want to cut it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.439 
do that but let's say you want to cut it
in<00:04:45.139> an<00:04:45.259> angle<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:46.789> know<00:04:46.880> usually<00:04:47.270> you're

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
in an angle you know usually you're

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.100 
in an angle you know usually you're
using<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:48.050> guide<00:04:48.440> up<00:04:48.620> here<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:50.090> show<00:04:51.050> you

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
using this guide up here to show you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.960 
using this guide up here to show you
what's<00:04:51.440> straight<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:52.370> if<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.639> wanted

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
what's straight but what if you wanted

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.260 
what's straight but what if you wanted
to<00:04:53.409> cut<00:04:54.409> it<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:55.639> bring<00:04:55.909> it<00:04:55.940> out<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.180> little<00:04:56.419> bit

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
to cut it and bring it out a little bit

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.719 
to cut it and bring it out a little bit
what<00:04:59.270> if<00:04:59.419> you<00:04:59.539> wanted<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.960> cut<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.460> along<00:05:01.460> this

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
what if you wanted to cut it along this

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.540 
what if you wanted to cut it along this
line<00:05:02.720> since<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.650> picture<00:05:03.979> wasn't<00:05:04.250> taken

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
line since the picture wasn't taken

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.920 
line since the picture wasn't taken
straight<00:05:04.849> you<00:05:05.720> can<00:05:05.900> do<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:07.009> that<00:05:07.159> line

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
straight you can do that and that line

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.439 
straight you can do that and that line
yeah<00:05:08.930> this<00:05:09.830> little<00:05:10.159> handle<00:05:10.550> thing<00:05:10.789> here<00:05:11.240> you

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
yeah this little handle thing here you

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.409 
yeah this little handle thing here you
hold<00:05:11.630> down<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:13.190> keep<00:05:13.759> pressure<00:05:14.030> on<00:05:14.210> the

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
hold down to keep pressure on the

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.409 
hold down to keep pressure on the
picture<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:19.460> left<00:05:19.669> a<00:05:19.819> little<00:05:19.970> bit<00:05:20.180> of<00:05:20.270> white

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
picture so I left a little bit of white

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.390 
picture so I left a little bit of white
so<00:05:20.599> I<00:05:20.659> can<00:05:20.810> make<00:05:20.900> one<00:05:21.110> more<00:05:21.139> cut<00:05:23.919> no<00:05:24.919> let's<00:05:25.219> do
