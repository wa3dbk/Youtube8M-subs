00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:31.280
 tomato that rolls on the plate which incidentally 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.080
 are required to open the card in the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.940

 we make a copy of it copy 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.680
 we come back here into the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.590
 pasta with tomato and go downstairs 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.380
 here in our new folder we open is a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.440

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:48.639
 Let's find folder number 84 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.639
 here we will find everything 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.210
 this name 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.840
 9 and 38 let's look here probably 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.250
 this 9 38 out of 9 this for yourself 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.690
 we make a copy of it 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.510
 we went back inside the pasta to the tomato 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:13.550
 and let's go down there again in our 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:16.060
 new folder and click here to return to 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.060
 arrow 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:27.169
 we go again in folder 0 to 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.680
 why notice here that it will not be 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.580
 need to make a copy of this year is 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.950
 a copy of this net dot file because 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.680
 because it opens here only that it is also 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.600
 to break and is the same file in it 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.419
 address or even location 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.940
 then in this case the one that is repeated 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.780
 we ignore it and it will only be this way 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.880
 so ready 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.470
 what we do we will open the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.950
 our new folder we already know 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.960
 tools that the board opens that are 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:07.010
