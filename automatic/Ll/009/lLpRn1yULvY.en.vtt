00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.610
 the next part we will do 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.910
 these are these golden pieces 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 golden segments blue beads i 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.980
 always took the blue fly in the middle I 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.880
 put it in later 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.840
 it was easier to connect the two parts because these 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.750
 where the middle does not count down every time 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.879
 let's start not to do it 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:43.129
 we first need to dial three 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.280
 beads then 93 return to gold 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:51.470
 top go through the last three 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.870
 gadgets type 9 and so in a circle in these 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.940
 I added the legs on top again 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.699
 little blue bead here this 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 That is, it turns out that I have on my legs 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.140
 not three beads just what's down here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 a4 i added it for color 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 matching here's the first element is 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.660
 of three gold 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 blue it will be the same leg with 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:29.620
 the other side . 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:34.250
 this is the part of the upper part that is this 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:39.040
 which edge now I'm starting a needle with 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 back side and spend through 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.180
 next 4 beads 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.590
 it turns out as though for the time being such 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.709
 shapeless loop but when i do 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.209
 First of all, she will pull the whole row 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:20.290
 the whole structure and it will be easier to fit 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:27.819
 on the shape of the testicles that is, it will turn out 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 so I have to collect now 9 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.310
 beads and 4 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.710
 so I finished my second part now 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.620
 it remains the most difficult as if 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.670
 it is necessary to connect the two parts together difficult 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.740
 it's because the distance is in some 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.740
 places does not match here let's say 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:16.340
 from below it is visible that width is wider than on each side 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.520
 let's say yes how will i stitch these both 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 parts here I will start from here the water 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.470
 no matter where the main thing is not 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.830
 shift because then it will 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.670
 noticeable I'll let you take the war from here 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.660
 how old is me 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.600
 let's say 4 5 beads need i 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 compare with this place but on the other 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.370
 parties are important that they be 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.650
 symmetrically stitched no matter how many mm 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.640
 in series in the year from the bottom 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.190
 sides while I howl the difference in serenko 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.010
 The main thing is that if you have a close 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.710
 fit two parts of this god then 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.590
 exactly the same distance should be 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.050
 on the other hand it wo n't be easy at first 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.930
 because everything goes but then after 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:07.130
 literally a few stitches when you have 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.980
 already it is beginning to be easy as it will 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:15.650
 stitch i'm here i will cling to it 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.410
 blue beads that are in the middle of 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.960
 me from two sides here between them 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.450
 distance of course different therefore 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.430
 say how many beads will 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.370
 recruit me or how many 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.510
 beads need to tell you I can not 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.080
 blanks and egg are all different i will show 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.510
 middle of my work that is how i sewed 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.670
 them because the beginning is clear to me 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.580
 have to play a little to watch 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.740
 it's not very interesting and of course 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.890
 the final version when everything will be 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.980
 ready here I want to show which 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.150
 Stage I was first I 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.560
 just connected the two parts together 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.790
 drinking beads 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.080
 I will make such 4 flights then cut off 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.000
 fishing line and in the exact same place with 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.690
 added another five sirin he made another 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.210
 four flights afterwards and do the harvesting 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.040
 I can only pull the line here 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.880
 now down below let me have a lot 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.750
 it is easier to connect the parts and then 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.910
 move up and close here i would 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.300
 advised you to do that too because 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.729
 what did I start from where and how 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.700
 Well moved further further further 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.940
 until returning to original place 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.590
 it was harder than here I see 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.950
 I have a little lack of one 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.150
 a bead is possible later when I already 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.520
 will close from this side I'll pass 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.030
 fishing line through this side again and 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.490
 add how much is missing here I am 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.380
 finished 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.540
 tie the two halves here like this 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.540
 turned on the sides of the bottom 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.000
 if you have any questions leave 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.000
 them in the comments thank you for your attention
