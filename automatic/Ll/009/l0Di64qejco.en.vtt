 are always wonderfully installed here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 so if we look at the back 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.579
 here are some connections, such as 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 usb 2.0 2 x network usb 3 connection 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 Microphone in a headset 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.670
 Connection current also needs a and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.409
 in the middle of the head when we the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.090
 then we can do the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.840
 pull off the top and scotlands left 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.670
 then we can do that here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.350
 just pull out the tie so and then 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.180
 For example, this would be a second one 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.340
 Insert a hard disk and you can do that 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 not fool with sata and other 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.640
 side just the same again 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.299
 pull up and here is the here 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 hard disk disassembled and in the interior 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.500
 there's another inch hard drive 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.750
 inside, however, you buy the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 device itself would have to determine the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 you can not remove romping the hole 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.259
 is a sd-card slot so here you can 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.659
 then you insert sd card at the device 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.759
 like here just insert yours and here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.079
 are warmer status leds for the three 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.729
 hard drives as they are in operation 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.860
 and again for that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.360
 network here at the far end and otherwise 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.759
 we still have a little white light 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 what is still lit that the device 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.850
 just everything and I suppose here is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.130
 another small hole for the microphone 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.040
 Here you can see now also very much in operation 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.200
 on the s 7 series four cables 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.430
 tempo knife 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.180
 looks really nice and that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.299
 it was already very short 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.189
