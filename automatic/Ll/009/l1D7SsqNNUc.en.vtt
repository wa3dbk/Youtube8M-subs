00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.039
 surely you have a bit of confusion 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.549
 with your macronutrients how many should you 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.170
 eat at what time everything with the intention 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.109
 to have more energy because we all 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.910
 like to have more energy then I have 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.859
 created this video especially for you 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 I want to teach you a way to eat 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.739
 those macronutrients to support your 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.779
 hormones and in this way have more 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.640
 energy during the day and sleep a 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.290
 little bit better during the night 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.540
 then you know there are three types of 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.120
 macronutrients protein hydrates 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 carbon and fats then let's talk 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.340
 a little bit of cortisol and melatonin that 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 are the two main hormones here in 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.180
 this game day and night because 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.070
 during the day what we have more 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 elevated is cortisol which is what we 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.590
 gives the truth energy is what makes us 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.570
 the a takes us out of bed is a hormone 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.700
 catabolic type and then during the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.410
 night we have melatonin which is the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.420
 what makes us good so it starts 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.010
 the dream and that we can go to rest 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.910
 then these two hormones follow a 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.860
 circadian cycle called we're going to 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.460
 try to draw it here it's worth 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 then cortisol 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.130
 is higher by midmorning then 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.420
 when we wake up it starts to go up 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.900
 reaches a maximum and then then already 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.870
 start to go down 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.880
 then in the morning or midday to 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.100
 mid morning or so around here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 when we wake up is a little 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.440
 before then that's when our 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.300
 cortisol is higher 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.670
 and what does cortisol 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.010
 cortisol cortisol does many things but 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.290
 mainly two has an effect 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.490
 anti-inflammatory 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.170
 when you have played a soccer match 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.850
 sure you have noticed that you do not 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.500
 it hurt nothing and then when you've fought 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.330
 you have cooled down you have started the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 things is because your cortisol was 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.780
 elevated you have anti-inflammatory effect 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 also what cortisol does is that 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.750
 regulates blood glucose level 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.000
 then when the glucose is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.320
 too low the body the brain 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.880
 sends the signal that increases the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.070
 cortisol and cortisol mobilizes 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.900
 glycogen and mobilizes fats and other 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.450
 resources so that the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.860
 glucose in the blood so that we have 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.530
 energy is worth then how should we eat 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.880
 us to support this curve and to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.590
 that during the day 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.590
 our cortisol is as high as possible 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 not as high as possible exaggerating what 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.720
 but a normal thing obviously and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.150
 during the night that is not so high 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 then playing with one macronutrients 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.370
 little is important in the morning take 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.019
 more proteins and the problem is that the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.030
 Most people get up and take a 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.160
 juice or if you take some cereal or a piece 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.989
 of fruit and good because that can be 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 well it depends on sometimes of the day but in 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.640
 general because it is better to take proteins 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.349
 because if we drink a juice or 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.690
 something that has a hydrate content 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.700
 very high carbon because it already 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.900
 we are sending the signal to the body of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.650
 that does not need to increase the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.989
 cortisol so much then what would happen 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.470
 that our cortisol would stay a little 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.470
 over here 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.170
 and then what happens that we do not start 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.930
 We have as much energy as usual 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.250
 if you change after getting up not 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.130
 you need to have the tray of al 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.989
 side of the bed if you get up you give yourself 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.300
 a shower you start to change what 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.670
 you follow your routine you see a little cup of 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.709
 warm water with maybe a lemon or something 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.690
 well a little salt and half past 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.450
 hour 40 minutes you prepare a good 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.100
 breakfast that contains proteins and 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.060
 proteins there so you have a lot of 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.530
 sources 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.900
 you have animal proteins you have 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.670
 vegetable proteins also spirulina 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.800
 that can be carolina's husband you can 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.420
 take some eggs whatever but 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.730
 have proteins then what are you going to 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.410
 to do is that you're not going to give it that much load 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.959
 the body of carbohydrates and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.700
 then the body of ciro or the one that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.290
 we need to raise the cortisol a little bit 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.120
 so that there are more hydrates that is what 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.440
 we need in the blood now for 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.200
 have a lot of energy during the day 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.610
 then at that moment if you take a 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.300
 proper breakfast 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.410
 and cortisol will be more in place 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.709
 right let's say in your ideal place it's worth 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.250
 what happens if we do not take anything 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.110
 absolutely fast then the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.240
 body will send the message to say 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.890
 that there is no food come let's go hunting 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.990
 then it will go up even more 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.330
 cortisol and then it will be around here 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.580
 cortisol and there are many people who do 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.720
 intermittent fasting that does not really 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.010
 intermittent knows all the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.440
 mornings with which is not intermittent 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.850
 it is chronic and that which makes it 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.130
 They give energy rush it feels great 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.440
 is going to eat the world but of course this 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.600
 like everything is a double-edged blade 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.070
 Beware intermittent fasting because 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.260
 if you do it too much if you abuse 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 too much is not more than it is is not more than 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.470
 squeeze the accelerator too much and 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.030
 final 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.430
 in the car, you can burn 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.150
 then you have to use it in a way 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.860
 intelligent in general the normal if not 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.110
 nothing happens to you if you are not with a problem 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.120
 digestive the normal thing is to start the day 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.560
 with a good breakfast that has proteins 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 as the day progresses then it does not 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.310
 we need cortisol to be so 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.420
 high vale let's put it here with color 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.860
 red already enough here cortisol 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.660
 rather smaller in that area already 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.280
 we analyze that cortisol is so high 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.990
 how can we do that by giving it more 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.640
 carbohydrates because if you give it 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.550
 carbohydrates to the body then 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.020
 the brain to say that we already have and 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.170
 all of carbon we do not have glucose in 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.360
 blood and we do not need to go up so much 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.790
 the cortisol if you do not give it instead 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.440
 no carbohydrates gives you 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.630
 only proteins all day 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.760
 a dinner that consists only of us in 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.230
 meat or all proteins that will happen 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.140
 that then your cortisol will go up 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.360
 will go up here and then you're not going to 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.540
 sleep well because if the cortisol is 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.690
 high your melatonin can not be high 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.820
 ok because they are contrary when the 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.740
 cortisol stato melatonin is low and 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.040
 when when the cortisol is down 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.080
 then the smallest tonina starts to climb 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.080
 this is already melatonin 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.530
 then I hope you have explained me 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.139
 but the idea is that you support this curve 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.580
 that you support this cortisol curve that 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.810
 the best way to do it is that 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.569
 taking more protein during the morning 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.879
 it's worth it and it will understand you to take more hydrates 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.770
 carbon at night also 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.509
 think that if you take the dinner and you have 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.490
 many proteins are you proteins in 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.710
 general it takes longer to digest then 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.229
 you will not sleep well if you go to bed 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.349
 Less than three hours apart 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.509
 since dinner you will then eat more 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.039
 protein in the morning takes more 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.770
 hydrates in the evening and at night and 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:54.810
 Will support this curve of cortisol with 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.990
 which will have more energy and you will sleep 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.530
 better forget about the breakfasts 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.990
 light or only with only consistent in 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.969
 Carbohydrates is not the best 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.159
 way to start the day careful with 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.810
 strategically intermittent fasting is 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.169
 You can use from time to time but not 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.120
 the best of long strategies and 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.520
 medium term because we live in a world 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.440
 very stressful and you can melt you can 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.920
 start having dysfunctions of your 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.260
 glands 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.820
 arenas that synthesize 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.190
 all these hormones and I also hope that 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.590
 you found it interesting and good then 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.850
 be one more strategy that you use in 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.630
 your day to day to have more energy 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.680
 be healthier and good then be happy 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.680
 greetings see you later
