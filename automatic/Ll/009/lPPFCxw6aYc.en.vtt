one Episode four discs I'm assuming the

reevaluating it without watching it just
kind<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.340> thinking<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.760> over<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:50.970> I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
kind of thinking it over because I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.270 
kind of thinking it over because I
actually<00:03:51.330> wanted<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.780> save<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.769> second

out<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:57.230> think<00:03:58.489> without<00:04:00.830> its<00:04:01.830> game<00:04:02.010> giving

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
out I think without its game giving

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.830 
out I think without its game giving
stuff<00:04:02.850> away<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.120> think<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.570> kind<00:04:03.780> of

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
stuff away I think that kind of

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.420 
stuff away I think that kind of
drawn-out

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
drawn-out

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.550

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
goodbye the last 20 minutes the episode

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.370 
goodbye the last 20 minutes the episode
me<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> little<00:04:08.580> bit<00:04:08.700> too<00:04:08.970> long<00:04:09.380> because

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
me it was a little bit too long because

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.160 
me it was a little bit too long because
the<00:04:10.590> plot<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:11.310> actually<00:04:11.910> really<00:04:12.300> resolved<00:04:12.900> 20

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
minutes before the episode ends I think

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.970 
minutes before the episode ends I think
they<00:04:16.049> could<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.230> cut<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.560> down<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.799> little

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
they could have cut that down a little

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.970 
they could have cut that down a little
bit<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:17.519> that's<00:04:17.640> only<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.000> minor<00:04:18.239> gripe<00:04:18.980> but

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
bit but that's only a minor gripe but

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.740 
bit but that's only a minor gripe but
you'll<00:04:20.519> have<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.790> watch<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.180> yourself<00:04:21.630> to

you'll have to watch that yourself to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.680 
you'll have to watch that yourself to
make<00:04:21.900> your<00:04:22.049> own<00:04:22.140> determination<00:04:23.630> anyway<00:04:24.630> so
