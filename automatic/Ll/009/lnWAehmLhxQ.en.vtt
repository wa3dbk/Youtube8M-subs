going<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.759> technical<00:00:15.360> definition<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
going the technical definition is that

every day
in<00:00:40.050> every<00:00:40.770> plant<00:00:41.040> however<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.210> something<00:00:42.600> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in every plant however for something so

common<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> number<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
common there are a number of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
common there are a number of
misconceptions<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.450> galling<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.350> common

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
misconceptions about galling the common

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
misconceptions about galling the common
explanation<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> galling<00:00:47.910> process<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
explanation of the galling process is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600 
explanation of the galling process is
that<00:00:48.780> friction<00:00:49.350> causes<00:00:49.739> heat<00:00:49.980> which<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.579> turn

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that friction causes heat which in turn

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
that friction causes heat which in turn
melts<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> metal<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> create<00:00:52.110> miniature

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
melts the metal to create miniature

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.430 
melts the metal to create miniature
Wells<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> actuality<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.960> heat<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
Wells when in actuality the heat is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.810 
Wells when in actuality the heat is
driven<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:55.890> deformation<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> material

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
driven by deformation of the material

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
driven by deformation of the material
you've<00:00:57.690> seen<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.140> effect<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.710> you've<00:00:58.890> ever

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you've seen this effect if you've ever

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
you've seen this effect if you've ever
been<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> piece<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.879> metal<00:01:00.120> back<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> forth

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
been to a piece of metal back and forth

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.100 
been to a piece of metal back and forth
and<00:01:01.050> felt<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.620> heat<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.859> also<00:01:02.899> fusion<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and felt it heat up also fusion of the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.289 
and felt it heat up also fusion of the
two<00:01:04.260> parts<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> due<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> adhesion<00:01:05.280> rather<00:01:06.090> than

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
two parts is due to adhesion rather than

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.870 
two parts is due to adhesion rather than
phase<00:01:06.600> change<00:01:07.189> meaning<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> bonding

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
phase change meaning that the bonding

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
phase change meaning that the bonding
mechanism<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.630> isn't<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> parts<00:01:10.500> melt

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
mechanism here isn't that the parts melt

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
mechanism here isn't that the parts melt
it's<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.909> close<00:01:12.150> enough<00:01:12.360> together

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's that they get close enough together

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's that they get close enough together
and<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.710> high<00:01:13.890> enough<00:01:14.189> energy<00:01:14.340> state<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and are at high enough energy state that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
and are at high enough energy state that
they<00:01:15.570> form<00:01:15.869> bonds<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.590> become<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.250> part<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
they form bonds and become one part so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.660 
they form bonds and become one part so
how<00:01:18.689> does<00:01:18.750> galling<00:01:19.320> occur<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
how does galling occur here we have a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
how does galling occur here we have a
representation<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:21.930> pieces<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.320> metal

sliding past each other to the naked eye

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
sliding past each other to the naked eye
this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.650> reasonable<00:01:26.220> representation<00:01:26.610> but

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this is a reasonable representation but
