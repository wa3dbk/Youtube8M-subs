00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.840
 Good people, I'm here as promised. 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.510
 is to make my assessment of the crime 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.000
 Origin girls like I told you it's 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.150
 that I had to pass on to people like this 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.490
 because my hair is half as 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.550
 curly and half smooth then you can not 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.259
 you have notion of how that crime 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.380
 stay in the hair, what is the result? 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.689
 so that's why I solved it. 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.180
 is making the board to stay until 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.449
 more cute in the video is also 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.449
 give a better image then the cream is 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.210
 I will do meetings for you is 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.100
 this from here the origin for hair 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.980
 chemically treated 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.300
 he has condemned these acts of bamboo 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.699
 Are you girls here? 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 He has one kilo giant 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:04.780
 so he quite lavishes the smell of it 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.120
 It would not be pleasant but it is a smell 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 soft is not the very strong smell not 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.350
 smell in your hair is 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.900
 he is so white, I will not go 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.130
 because otherwise it will fall here that he 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.050
 is not consistent and the good of that cream 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.690
 here gives rise to that they have no color 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.380
 before all are white as you can 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.080
 see him is white has no dye 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.550
 so I like it a lot because of this 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.460
 also and what he promises here he is a 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 reconstruction cream is what he has to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.800
 bamboo extract that act on the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.680
 wires damaged by chemical processes 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 leaving the hair more moisturized and 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.740
 repaired in addition to only nutritional value 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 contains vegetable keratin vitamin is 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.130
 silicon which proportion of 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.080
 deep hydration and good shine that I 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.140
 I found it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 but as you know I 'm suspicious 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.980
 all the prizes I bought until 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 now of the scale of origin did not 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.540
 No one told me this crime. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.120
 did not work that my hair then type 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 everyone I've used so far gives great 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.320
 results look pretty bright 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.700
 hair is soft silky 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.130
 But I thought you had a little bit of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
 I do not know if you will notice 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.360
 but I think it's a bit 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.990
 cold up here but it is due to plank 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.300
 okay because as curly hair is 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.990
 growing and when you make the plank and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.170
 It's kind of jabbery I used as 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.540
 finisher 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.520
 the total argan oil in ti is 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.620
 lowering this frizz a little 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.940
 so tomorrow he'll probably go 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.740
 dinho be more aligned tips ok 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.970
 super hydrated 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.740
 I'll have something new here for you to see. 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.740
 back like that's right 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220
 O 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 My hair is growing well too. 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.150
 fast and girls 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.090
 You're really good with a swing like that. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.240
 I like and I know how to enjoy 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.140
 I recommend you guys who want to test it 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.780
 This one with the yellow cap, which is the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.890
 for chemically treated hair tac 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:38.380
 has to camp and extract of bamboo 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:40.120
 I paid it very cheap O 5:50 the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.820
 pause time I left in my 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.519
 hair was 30 minutes fine though 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.040
 that he's not there to leave all this 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.739
 time is to leave three to five 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.230
 The more I like to leave more, the more 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.140
 because I always like to leave more 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.260
 strong that the result looks better, I 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.569
 I used only he did not put any balls 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.810
 or anything to see the result only 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.370
 of him I used two spoons as the hair 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.940
 it's small now it's consuming 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.280
 little product so better still, and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.190
 also reminding you that before 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.769
 apply the cream I used the shampoo 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.709
 anti-residues of the native fruit washed 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.510
 twice with him and is great shampoo 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.530
 also this residue I think was the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.360
 the best I have ever used and it is 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.890
 good also you use the shampoo 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.240
 anti-waste because it ends 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.030
 boosting 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.370
 In a certain way its hydration then it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.190
 left we are wide open to receive 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.289
 all the nutrients in your mask then 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.660
 It's always good you 're in love Pulls by 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.849
 up residue may be any which 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.030
 Do you have it in your house but never leave? 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.050
 Note that the type of waste is good 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.340
 so I'm super recommend to you is 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.590
 I very much hope you have 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.509
 I like this assessment of mine well 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.699
 simple quick little 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.889
 but as I said I wanted to come 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.930
 here to talk about that time 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.330
 It's not for you because I 'm in 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.789
 I'm going to stop doing the 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.370
 review videos that I've always done 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.530
 I love talking about long hair guy hair 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.039
 then one thing that I really like have 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.349
 nice to make a big kiss to 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.349
