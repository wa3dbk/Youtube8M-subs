00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:23.189
 1 not so much called mpd 7120 with this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.369
 radio without a drive that is drives on 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.060
 listen to it and either view 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 impossible but they and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.059
 really don't need there are attacking 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 nest beating move there is input aux then 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 have you can connect your background you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.410
 there will only be a background to this input 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.489
 what else did I like 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.739
 there is such an input for sd card 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.559
 Here is such an sd card example here I am 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 I use 8 gigabytes 8 gigabytes per 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:08.270
 card here it is inserted here all 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.920
 she does not interfere. of course a little in the way 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.450
 Well, since I have my right hand 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 I sometimes knocked this flash drive with my knee 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:23.340
 sd card you insert it absolutely 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 does not interfere and elegantly everything is available at dakor 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 remote control for comp 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.830
 as I do not use 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 what's the radio touch screen here 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:44.280
 that's shorter works here is the menu 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 here is a menu shorter here are radio and stars 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 sound setting card can 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.030
 connect some more video 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.690
 a player or something there 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.049
 additionally which table 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.780
 devices have connectivity 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.789
 to the management if you have a car 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.420
 This ability to control on the steering wheel 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.369
 there is a connectivity feature that's well 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.200
 is there another model like songs yet 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.970
 present in this model she is not not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:21.989
 There are installations such 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.700
 here that the subwoofer can connect it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.980
 we don't know what 's this 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.989
 increased mass shorter camera also 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.620
 set and us the rear view can be to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:44.090
 I know I am very pleased with it 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.090
 and there are no radio disks 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.060
 In principle, such a good tape recorder to their 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:03.950
 quite inexpensive 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:08.600
 in comparison a card such a card 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:14.630
 put music reads can also enter 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:18.410
 in the card than you can enter the disc menu 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.090
 but not the drive on your flash drive here 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.130
 You open such under the menu 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.709
 i.e. this is a menu of sound files here 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.620
 video files and this photo can 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.650
 still throw on the flash drive here press and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.459
 for example on the sound files of you 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.190
 everything is displayed shorter 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:44.840
 albums like and its recorded and there 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.420
 You choose any album you like 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.010
 above open you open completely 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:58.670
 all songs from this album 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:04.900
 that's what else there is a TV here's a button 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:07.190
 mods switch here this aux function 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 that is, the connection as I say 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.519
 control connection on the steering wheel 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:19.039
 so the second video input button 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:24.910
 extra here's a tv on 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.910
 the antenna catches bad in the garages 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:37.680
 shorter tv also works on the radio 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.840
 Here is such a tape recorder so if 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.110
 decide to take, I advise 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.430
 models are very cool their money studio 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.670
 and took for 3 and a half thousand in my opinion 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.070
 haven't regretted a second yet 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.160
 backlight adjustment that is in the dark 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.970
 because she lights up so much 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.610
 crescents lights abate 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.780
 It can generally be switched off so 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.260
 her account 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.660
 Lt backlight those who are also very keys 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.200
 a large selection of lights can be put 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.940
 multi 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.500
 she is gradually changing at night 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.810
 the colors here are these buttons very much 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:25.720
 looks nice here so if 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.530
 decide to buy this model or here 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.190
 I think I advise you here is a model 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.100
 called 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:40.450
