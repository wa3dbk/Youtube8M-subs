00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 after countless trials 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.569
 techniques I finally found the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 recipe for home preparation 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.849
 of improperly called margarine 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
 vegetable butter the other margarine is not 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 that a stable function of water in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
 oil where the watery part is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 represented by water or milk 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 vegetable while part ii tells you is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.920
 consisting of one or more oils that can 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 be coconut oil palm oil by 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 grapeseed sunflower and so on 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.009
 the biggest problem of the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.920
 preparation of margarine which is the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.800
 mass consolidation in fact if there is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.860
 we make good case both in oils and from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.290
 watery part are represented by 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 liquids at room temperature however the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 margarine as we know it yes 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 presents as a spreadable mass 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.610
 then semi-solid room temperature 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 at the industrial level the solution more 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 obvious is the much feared hydrogenation e 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 this technique involves the use of a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 catalyst in Niger for blowing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 hydrogen gas within the mass 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 of fat 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.280
 this results in the saturation of the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.070
 double bonds or in simple words 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 in the change of state from liquid to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 solid hydrogenation clearly not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 can be done at home 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.210
 but we will find a solution 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.799
 alternative 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 we prepare together in margarine in 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.159
 home for 100 grams of margarine 60 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.360
 milliliters of soy milk 5 ml 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 of wine vinegar a pinch of salt 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 35 thousand liters of coconut oil 10 thousand 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.720
 liters of sunflower oil or 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.100
 pips 12 grams of soy lecithin 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.869
 one gram of santana rubber 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.909
 so let's start with the preparation 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.189
 margarine the recipe is not 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.750
 absolutely difficult however it is good 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.000
 accurately weigh all 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080
 ingredients and also choose 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.820
 especially the right ingredients 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.860
 I, as I told you, did many 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 experiments and I came to this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.070
 conclusion 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.960
 so if you want to make changes to 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.030
 ingredients you need to experience at home 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 because I really do the experiments of it 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.580
 I made a lot of ok then the first one 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.080
 what to do is acidify the milk 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.440
 vegetable here I put soy milk 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.850
 natural we put about a teaspoon 5 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.300
 milliliters of vinegar 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.110
 we mix practically 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.700
 coagulate we put a pinch of salt 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.489
 even here with the salts set if 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.860
 prefer using margarine on one 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.019
 salted preparation add a 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.330
 little more than salt otherwise put it 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.610
 but a little pinch 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.260
 let's leave them about 10 minutes back 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.180
 maybe even the steel spoon 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.910
 which is better 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.040
 now let me explain two little things on the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.739
 choice of coconut oil because we have 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.840
 used coconut oil this is a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.489
 organic fat so choose too 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.799
 high quality products is important 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.480
 use coconut oil because the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.459
 lipid profile lends itself perfectly 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.549
 to the making of margarine 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.190
 enrico in fact of saturated fatty acids na 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.170
 chain media in particular we find the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.989
 caprini with the Libyan leader and lauric 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.720
 in while low is the amount of acid 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.269
 palmitic and of miricico that comes 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.420
 offset by a similar amount of 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.350
 oleic acid and to a lesser extent acid 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.480
 linoleic therefore despite being an oil 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.970
 rich in saturated fat is also true that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.220
 does not weigh too much on the levels of 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.500
 cholesterol because I remind you that this 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.200
 danger is related to the presence of acid 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.140
 enzyme palmitic of which the oil of 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.730
 coconut is not so rich while you were 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.290
 with palm oil then for this 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.930
 recipe we do not use palm oil 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.600
 coconut oil is fine or poured 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.549
 our coconut oil inside 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.700
 a becker 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.560
 we put a minimal part of oil of 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.260
 sunflower is fine also oil of 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:13.150
 seeds and we mix the two oils in the meantime 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:18.669
 very quickly so now we join the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.739
 known soy lecithin also emulsifier 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.419
 this I recommend a product of 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.669
 quality all the products i have 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.860
 but you can also buy them online 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.979
 request them in herbal medicine or in 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.979
 Pharmacy 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.940
 we put about one gram of rubber 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:43.500
 xanthan has more nor do you put more creamy and 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.500
 margarine will be solid 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:53.699
 then add the milk mixture of 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.699
 soy that has coagulated slightly 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.250
 we put everything 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.250
 we mix 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.540
 or mixed in all for about a minute 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.000
 minute and a half and this is the result 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.650
 if you find the liquid lecithin still 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.550
 better I unfortunately didn't find it 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.480
 however, even those in powder are fine 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.110
 we transfer everything to the inside 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.370
 of a bowl and then place in 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.200
 freezer for an hour cooling 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.660
 quick is essential for good 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.390
 success of the product because it favors 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.220
 the crystallization of the emulsion e 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.310
 gives different characteristics in 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.230
 therefore based on the speed of the process 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.300
 in the freezer an hour and then we see the 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.520
 final result after an hour of 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.710
 margarine freezing is ready for 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.430
 be used I'll show you the 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.150
 consistency you see creamy spreads on 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.200
 right point 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.170
 I make him also see how it is spread 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.570
 on an integral cracker in this case 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.840
 I don't particularly like her from 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.730
 so eat rather then 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.610
 use for the preparation of desserts 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:11.700
 but if you like it you can also eat it 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:14.280
 with bread you can keep it in the fridge 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.070
 for a month after freezing 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.260
 or you can leave it in the freezer and b 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.960
 will last a year but always remember to 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.980
 let it thaw in the refrigerator 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.990
 before consumption 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.460
 I hope my margarine recipe 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.230
 you may find it useful to put a mi 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.230
 like it if you liked gassman
