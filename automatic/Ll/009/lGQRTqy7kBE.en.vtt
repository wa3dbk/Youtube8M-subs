00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.149
 disney today is an icon of 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:10.090
 the animations and like any great company 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.179
 It has its distinctive logo and 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.700
 characters that represent it and if you 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.250
 you put a little to think and to reflect 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.609
 in Disney's history you will notice which ones 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.740
 they are three of his main characters 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.810
 starting with mickey mouse the duck 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.470
 donald and that's how it is 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.500
 Bufí and precisely who is goofy 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.990
 we will deal with today's issue since there is a 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.650
 question that I suppose you have done in 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.680
 more than once who is the wife of 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.820
 goofy since as we have seen 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.210
 has a son named max then who 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.880
 is the mother of most first you 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.150
 I commented that what you will hear is not a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.200
 theory but there are tests which 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.920
 to go explaining below 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.040
 to start the one that was the wife of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 goofy is not even an animal like 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 he is he but he is a human being a 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 little weird not the first time he does 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.979
 appearance the goofy wife is in the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 chapter called cool word 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.420
 It is here that we clearly see that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 is about a dog or some other animal 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.630
 but it is merely a human its 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.550
 wife from that chapter appears 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.509
 in some others like in the chapter 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.259
 called a weekend with dad but 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.270
 clear they were only brief appearances never 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.540
 much importance was given to that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.940
 character but without a doubt the most 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.720
 important that marks way in the 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.680
 history of goofy and disney is the weird 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.820
 chapter called the rest day of 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.009
 dad who tries to goofy is done 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.800
 spend a whole day for his wife 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.050
 thus fulfilling the duties as 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.530
 wash the dishes make the food 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.979
 etcetera while his wife leaves 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.880
 walk 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.990
 goofy dresses in women's clothes and is 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.560
 here when it starts the whole door sounds 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.040
 buf and will open it and just when the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 abre realizes that the milkman is the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.070
 which receives it with a kiss thinking that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.740
 the wife of goofy subsequently the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.800
 supermarket delivery man makes 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.560
 exactly the same and even the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.130
 In charge of the dry cleaners it gets very 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.250
 elegant at the time of supposedly going 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.040
 with the wife of goofy 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.010
 after reflecting for a while and putting together 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.440
 conclusions in his head bufí is given 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.370
 mind that possibly his wife 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.550
 cheat and unconsciously it is believed that 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.460
 enters a certain depression since 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.210
 thousands of things went through his head on 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.150
 episode ends apparently fine 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.770
 that's the last time you saw yourself in a 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.750
 animated chapter to goofy's wife is 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.480
 believes that in the safest is that goofy 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.420
 he went into a rage and had something to do with 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.080
 his disappearance or maybe just the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.960
 Goofy's wife that day left him already 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.900
 that as the facts indicate it was not 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.650
 a woman who was very interested in her 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.140
 relationship there are more conclusions but 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.790
 those for me are the most successful
