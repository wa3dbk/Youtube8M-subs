intention and consciousness around where
you're<00:03:40.760> spending<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.180> when<00:03:41.900> you're<00:03:42.049> investing

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
you're spending it when you're investing

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.199 
you're spending it when you're investing
money<00:03:42.620> into<00:03:42.920> your<00:03:43.040> business<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.700> into<00:03:44.120> your

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
money into your business or into your

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.000 
money into your business or into your
own<00:03:44.330> education<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.019> tends<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.440> come<00:03:45.650> back<00:03:45.830> to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
own education it tends to come back to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.100 
own education it tends to come back to
you<00:03:46.130> as<00:03:46.340> well<00:03:46.370> when<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.180> allow<00:03:47.420> money<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.870> leak

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
you as well when you allow money to leak

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.350 
you as well when you allow money to leak
out<00:03:48.260> in<00:03:48.470> less<00:03:48.799> intentional<00:03:49.400> ways<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.850> tends<00:03:50.209> to

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
out in less intentional ways it tends to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.120 
out in less intentional ways it tends to
just<00:03:50.900> find<00:03:51.140> other<00:03:51.350> people<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:51.739> hang<00:03:51.950> out<00:03:52.070> with

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
just find other people to hang out with

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.850 
just find other people to hang out with
so<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.000> distinction<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.720> money<00:03:54.230> will<00:03:54.830> go

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
so the distinction is that money will go

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.860 
so the distinction is that money will go
wherever<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.610> want<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.299> go<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:56.450> if<00:03:56.750> you're

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
wherever you want it to go so if you're

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.360 
wherever you want it to go so if you're
not<00:03:56.989> conscious<00:03:57.320> about<00:03:57.680> where<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.070> want<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.310> to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
not conscious about where you want it to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.640 
not conscious about where you want it to
go<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.269> will<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.570> link<00:03:59.870> out<00:04:00.049> in<00:04:00.260> other

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
go then it will just link out in other

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.590 
go then it will just link out in other
ways<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.790> these<00:04:01.910> are<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.209> some<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.480> my

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
ways so these are just some of my

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.150 
ways so these are just some of my
discoveries<00:04:03.200> about<00:04:03.350> money<00:04:03.620> over<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.950> past
