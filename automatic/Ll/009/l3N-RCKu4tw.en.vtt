how easy it's going to be to digitally
removing<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:06.870> an<00:00:07.020> image<00:00:07.290> depends<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.160> a

removing from an image depends on a
couple<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.610> things<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.809> image<00:00:10.110> scanned

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
couple of things was the image scanned

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.789 
couple of things was the image scanned
in<00:00:10.620> color<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.160> what<00:00:11.700> color<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.450> ink<00:00:12.660> if<00:00:12.960> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799

and we're going to draw a selection
around<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> names<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.830> we're<00:01:25.830> going

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
around one of the names and we're going

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.230 
around one of the names and we're going
to<00:01:26.070> move<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> over<00:01:26.689> into<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:28.110> area

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
to move it over into a different area

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
to move it over into a different area
well<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.600> rid<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> ink<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
well that got rid of the ink we have a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
well that got rid of the ink we have a
repeat<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> take<00:01:32.909> care<00:01:33.180> of
