so<00:00:16.219> we<00:00:16.460> produce<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:17.359> Explorer<00:00:17.840> cases<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:19.010> have

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
so we produce the Explorer cases to have

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.720 
so we produce the Explorer cases to have
another<00:00:20.779> mininum<00:00:21.170> case<00:00:21.410> which<00:00:22.039> has<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.250> totally

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
another mininum case which has a totally

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.929 
another mininum case which has a totally
new<00:00:22.939> design<00:00:23.150> not<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> standard<00:00:24.519> luggage<00:00:25.519> design

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
new design not a standard luggage design

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.060 
new design not a standard luggage design
from<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:26.449> aluminum<00:00:26.869> cases<00:00:27.410> we<00:00:27.710> wanted<00:00:27.980> to

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
from the aluminum cases we wanted to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.400 
from the aluminum cases we wanted to
have<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.279> much<00:00:28.880> nicer<00:00:29.150> shape<00:00:29.630> in<00:00:29.929> a<00:00:30.650> combination

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
have a much nicer shape in a combination

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.510 
have a much nicer shape in a combination
so<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:34.370> find<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:35.030> kind<00:00:35.270> of<00:00:35.570> new<00:00:36.469> design<00:00:36.890> we

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
so to find this kind of new design we

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.240 
so to find this kind of new design we
had<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.910> make<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.270> material<00:00:38.989> mix<00:00:39.620> between<00:00:39.890> a

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
had to make a material mix between a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.740 
had to make a material mix between a
plastic<00:00:40.760> fiber<00:00:41.239> material<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:43.300> analog<00:00:44.300> sided

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
plastic fiber material and analog sided

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.410 
plastic fiber material and analog sided
aluminium<00:00:45.289> material<00:00:45.910> with<00:00:46.910> that<00:00:47.059> kind<00:00:47.329> of

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
aluminium material with that kind of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.540 
aluminium material with that kind of
combination<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:48.620> were<00:00:48.770> able<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.100> create<00:00:49.520> a

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
combination we were able to create a

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.049 
combination we were able to create a
totally<00:00:50.030> new<00:00:50.059> design<00:00:50.600> on<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.079> market<00:00:52.059> with

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
totally new design on the market with

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.970 
totally new design on the market with
these<00:00:53.300> two<00:00:53.600> with<00:00:54.109> this<00:00:54.199> combination<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.829> the

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
these two with this combination of the

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.420 
these two with this combination of the
two<00:00:55.160> materials<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.059> allows<00:00:56.329> us<00:00:56.359> to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
two materials and it allows us to

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.279 
two materials and it allows us to
include<00:00:58.430> special<00:00:59.000> features<00:00:59.420> like<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.989> handle

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
include special features like the handle

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.160 
include special features like the handle
cribs<00:01:00.559> like<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.789> top<00:01:02.000> straps<00:01:02.449> which<00:01:02.840> allows

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
cribs like the top straps which allows

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.789 
cribs like the top straps which allows
you<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.469> put<00:01:03.949> top<00:01:04.370> bags<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.850> these<00:01:05.360> bags<00:01:05.799> so

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
you to put top bags on these bags so

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.340 
you to put top bags on these bags so
this<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.000> biggest<00:01:08.150> challenge<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:09.170> create

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
this was the biggest challenge to create

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
this was the biggest challenge to create
that<00:01:09.830> new<00:01:10.009> design<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.700> cases<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.299> now<00:01:11.509> we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
that new design of the cases and now we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.260 
that new design of the cases and now we
have<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.049> possibility<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.890> go<00:01:13.280> further<00:01:13.610> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
have the possibility to go further to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.899 
have the possibility to go further to
offer<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.689> in<00:01:14.840> different<00:01:15.020> colors<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.920> also

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909

strong<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:36.229> not<00:01:36.439> pretty<00:01:36.740> easy<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.280> say<00:01:37.520> if<00:01:38.000> we

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
strong it's not pretty easy to say if we

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.120 
strong it's not pretty easy to say if we
compare<00:01:38.509> them<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.110> aluminium<00:01:39.470> standard

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
compare them to the aluminium standard

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.749 
compare them to the aluminium standard
cases<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:40.790> have<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:42.049> special<00:01:42.759> strengthened

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
cases which have a special strengthened

cases which have a special strengthened
part<00:01:44.659> which<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.530> lower<00:01:45.710> side<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.040> on

part which is on the lower side and on

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.910 
part which is on the lower side and on
the<00:01:46.430> other<00:01:46.520> side<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.180> case<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.719> would<00:01:48.649> say

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the other side of the case I would say

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.819 
the other side of the case I would say
no<00:01:50.020> that's<00:01:51.020> not<00:01:51.259> possible

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
no that's not possible

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.850 
no that's not possible
due<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.310> material<00:01:52.820> mix<00:01:53.119> but<00:01:53.840> they<00:01:54.680> are

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
due to the material mix but they are

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.209 
due to the material mix but they are
strong<00:01:55.189> enough<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.820> resist<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:57.039> normal<00:01:58.039> use
