figuarts<00:00:06.089> Super<00:00:07.080> Saiyan<00:00:07.319> 2<00:00:07.620> &amp;<00:00:07.950> 1<00:00:08.519> son<00:00:09.150> gohan

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
figuarts Super Saiyan 2 &amp; 1 son gohan

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.839 
figuarts Super Saiyan 2 &amp; 1 son gohan
he's<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> pretty<00:00:12.300> good<00:00:12.389> figure<00:00:12.929> overall<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.849> did

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
he's a pretty good figure overall I did

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
he's a pretty good figure overall I did
think<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.179> he<00:00:15.450> would<00:00:15.540> be<00:00:15.690> bigger<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
think that he would be bigger in the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.189 
think that he would be bigger in the
pictures<00:00:16.949> they<00:00:17.160> always<00:00:17.430> zoomed<00:00:17.670> up<00:00:17.820> close<00:00:18.330> so

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
pictures they always zoomed up close so

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.010 
pictures they always zoomed up close so
it<00:00:19.230> looks<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.560> he'd<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.859> bigger<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.869> this<00:00:21.869> is

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
it looks like he'd be bigger but this is

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.769 
it looks like he'd be bigger but this is
him<00:00:22.199> compared<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.100> Irwin<00:00:23.939> Vegeta<00:00:24.390> so

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
him compared to an Irwin Vegeta so

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.200 
him compared to an Irwin Vegeta so
they're<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> same<00:00:25.380> size<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.980> i<00:00:26.849> paid

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
they're about the same size and i paid

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
they're about the same size and i paid
about<00:00:27.330> 40<00:00:27.750> bucks<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.349> i<00:00:28.410> thought<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
about 40 bucks for me so i thought that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
about 40 bucks for me so i thought that
he<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:28.980> leads<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.279> bigger<00:00:30.349> they<00:00:31.349> usually

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
he get leads to be bigger they usually

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
he get leads to be bigger they usually
run<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.040> seventy<00:00:32.579> dollars<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.239> she<00:00:33.300> can

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
run for about seventy dollars so she can

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
run for about seventy dollars so she can
