 Hello everyone in this video I want to show 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.030
 your very first homemade knife with 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 whose so began my 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.770
 homemade craze 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 simple kitchen knives 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.480
 here well here is more true that from it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 1 knife left this knife was made but 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 and around 2001 at that time I 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 still worked at the factory so I was 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.640
 access 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 emery and to drilling installation affair 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.340
 I wear about six months doing during 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.520
 smoke breaks so to speak for five minutes 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:54.140
 spent time building this knife did 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.120
 he became the favorite knife in the kitchen 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.840
 until about 2005 they constantly 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.719
 enjoyed 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 as if there were no problems and here in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.280
 About 2005 I began to carve 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.650
 chicken and apparently boneless sloppy 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.030
 began to work for me formed here in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.880
 I had to sharpen this place 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.229
 climbed a little later to do to remove 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.619
 this rock poke your nose portion but apparently there all 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.420
 equal crack and about it 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.869
 still worked some time that night and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 around 2008 he broke off 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.770
 but since the knife was really very 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.810
 good in the kitchen as it became the most 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.970
 favorite knife was a pity to throw out 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 this scrap I decided to give it a second 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.770
 life eventually came here such 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:55.820
 small knife to clean the potatoes itself 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.079
 that's it 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.600
 I also tried the handle 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.170

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:15.720
