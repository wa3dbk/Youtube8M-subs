00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
position my final probe put them to a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.819 
position my final probe put them to a
close<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:50.239> he<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> battle<00:00:52.260> cruisers<00:00:52.590> on

close one he so the battle cruisers on
against<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.640> fun<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:55.379> usually

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
against there was fun but they usually

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
against there was fun but they usually
have<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> spire<00:00:56.340> come<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.660> even<00:00:57.870> though

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
have a spire come in like even though

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
have a spire come in like even though
that<00:00:58.199> last<00:00:58.410> guy<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> played<00:00:59.280> whenever<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.030> showed

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that last guy I played whenever I showed

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.660 
that last guy I played whenever I showed
the<00:01:00.359> video<00:01:00.590> went<00:01:01.590> roaches<00:01:02.070> he's<00:01:02.340> still<00:01:02.550> at

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the video went roaches he's still at

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
the video went roaches he's still at
aspiring<00:01:03.030> coming<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.690> battle<00:01:03.989> cruisers

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
aspiring coming on my battle cruisers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.770 
aspiring coming on my battle cruisers
were<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.689> mean<00:01:07.619> yeah

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
were and it just I mean yeah

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.510 
were and it just I mean yeah
if<00:01:09.260> they<00:01:09.409> have<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.530> spire<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:09.860> lose<00:01:10.250> if<00:01:10.430> he

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
if they have a spire I lose if he

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.620 
if they have a spire I lose if he
wouldn't<00:01:10.729> been<00:01:10.850> getting<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.060> spire<00:01:11.390> out<00:01:11.600> i

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
wouldn't been getting that spire out i

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.210 
wouldn't been getting that spire out i
think<00:01:11.780> i<00:01:11.960> would<00:01:12.080> have<00:01:12.170> won<00:01:12.290> that<00:01:12.440> game<00:01:12.650> in<00:01:12.920> fact

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
think i would have won that game in fact

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.090 
think i would have won that game in fact
i<00:01:13.340> know<00:01:13.400> i<00:01:13.520> would<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.790> won<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:13.970> game<00:01:14.180> but

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
i know i would have won that game but

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.499 
i know i would have won that game but
they<00:01:16.100> just<00:01:16.250> takes<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:16.760> long<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.030> do

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
they just takes so long to do

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.310 
they just takes so long to do
significant<00:01:18.049> damage<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.630> didn't<00:01:20.930> work<00:01:21.110> a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
significant damage that it didn't work a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.840 
significant damage that it didn't work a
mess<00:01:23.200> but<00:01:24.200> live<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.590> learn<00:01:24.680> i'll<00:01:25.640> still

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
mess but live and learn i'll still

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.190 
mess but live and learn i'll still
probably<00:01:25.940> try<00:01:26.300> my<00:01:26.479> next<00:01:26.720> couple<00:01:26.960> Terran

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
probably try my next couple Terran

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.120 
probably try my next couple Terran
returns<00:01:31.479> so<00:01:32.619> I've<00:01:33.619> been<00:01:33.770> told<00:01:33.830> I'm<00:01:34.100> not

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
returns so I've been told I'm not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.710 
returns so I've been told I'm not
supposed<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.580> get<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.729> gas<00:01:34.970> until<00:01:35.360> my<00:01:35.479> cyber

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
supposed to get a gas until my cyber

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.160 
supposed to get a gas until my cyber
course<00:01:36.080> come<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.470> not<00:01:37.100> really<00:01:37.220> sure<00:01:37.430> why<00:01:37.610> but

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
course come in not really sure why but

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.700 
course come in not really sure why but
that's<00:01:39.170> what<00:01:39.380> people<00:01:39.649> say<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:39.890> I'll<00:01:40.399> try<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.700> I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
that's what people say so I'll try it I

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.910 
that's what people say so I'll try it I
guess<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.860> could<00:01:43.009> see<00:01:43.190> some<00:01:43.369> logic<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.920> just

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
guess I could see some logic in it just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.040 
guess I could see some logic in it just
having<00:01:46.130> more<00:01:46.310> minerals<00:01:46.700> early<00:01:47.479> game<00:01:47.659> 4<00:01:48.020> yes

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
having more minerals early game 4 yes

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.830 
having more minerals early game 4 yes
you're<00:01:51.050> kind<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.229> like<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> guests<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> my

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
you're kind of like the guests so my

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.990 
you're kind of like the guests so my
probe<00:01:54.259> scout<00:01:54.500> failed<00:01:54.770> we're<00:01:55.250> close<00:01:55.729> air

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
probe scout failed we're close air

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.330 
probe scout failed we're close air
positions<00:01:56.479> he's<00:01:56.960> getting<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.500> gateway<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.830> he

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
positions he's getting a gateway to he

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.820 
positions he's getting a gateway to he
probably<00:01:58.550> has<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.819> gas<00:01:59.090> coming<00:01:59.440> in<00:02:00.440> fact<00:02:00.710> i'm

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
probably has a gas coming in fact i'm

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.749 
probably has a gas coming in fact i'm
gonna<00:02:00.950> get<00:02:01.069> my<00:02:01.159> gas<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:01.580> screw<00:02:01.909> them<00:02:03.520> yeah<00:02:04.520> he

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
gonna get my gas now screw them yeah he

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.870 
gonna get my gas now screw them yeah he
already<00:02:04.940> has<00:02:05.210> his<00:02:05.360> gas<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:06.550> i'll<00:02:07.550> be<00:02:07.640> at<00:02:07.759> my

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
already has his gas in i'll be at my

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.520 
already has his gas in i'll be at my
core<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.300> timely<00:02:08.539> fashion<00:02:08.660> though

out I'm gonna get a second second and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.570 
out I'm gonna get a second second and
third<00:03:17.320> gateway<00:03:17.709> cuz<00:03:17.980> pretty<00:03:18.220> much<00:03:18.340> no<00:03:18.490> matter

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
third gateway cuz pretty much no matter
