00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 as promised they are to register and to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.250
 tell you in the second video how it is 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 prepare a quality sandwich here at 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
 this point we are at home we are not at 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.900
 bar and we can choose how 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.730
 balance the amount of protein e 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.990
 then those that come from the ham 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 from another salon and from cheese 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.410
 compared to carbohydrates here you keep 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.039
 present a rule so coarse that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 for every 15 grams more or less of bread 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.890
 you can put about 30 grams of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.350
 proteins therefore of cheese 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 recognized a mixture between the two 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 this will allow you to create 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.500
 sandwiches both for you but also for yours 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.420
 children who perhaps choosing the good 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 ham of good cold cuts and choosing 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 or some good cheese using a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.410
 good quality bread or that you make yourself in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 home you or maybe you can buy e 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.379
 today there are more and more bakeries that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.090
 make bread with sourdough and then 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 you can buy some bread with pasta 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.780
 mother using this bread with the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 you will have much less dough 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 swelling in the belly when you eat 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 this sandwich and so here if 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.450
 you will use the rules I gave also 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.939
 in the first in the first video you find 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.010
 in our channel and that you go to see 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.439
 which you can find by saying how 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 eat the sandwich video what happens 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.570
 that you see that you have to chew for a long time 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.360
 and chewing for a long time at least then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.509
 10 15 also see thirty times each bite 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.600
 you will also enjoy the pleasure of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.369
 enjoy neither food you have also chosen 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.079
 best for you and your children 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 with these balances you will see that i 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.159
 your children at school will be more lucid 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 you at work will be more lucid because 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.450
 you have stimulated insulin as little as I have 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.799
 already explained in the pasta video 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 had to finish the pasta dish 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.759
 clearly if this sandwich praise him 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.290
 take fishing trips to your children right away 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.909
 after a sports activity 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.799
 the amount of bread can be 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.770
 higher than this I have just 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.570
 described that is very well stuffed but that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.869
 however it allows you to get everyone 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.409
 these advantages as I say as usual 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.070
 in the next video you find at this
