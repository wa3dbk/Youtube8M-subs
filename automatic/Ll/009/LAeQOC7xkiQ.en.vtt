00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.280
 you a fast and very good recipe 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.889
 for colds and to help 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.730
 our children to expectorate when they 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.120
 have fallen ill with the flu or good cold 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.440
 it's very easy to do first they need 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.070
 Ginseng in English and in Spanish is 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.320
 ginger in peru we say that the only thing 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.560
 what do they fight over here is the one 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.219
 it's all I've been preparing this is the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.120
 script to me the ginger it bites from this 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.220
 way of thin manners need 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.350
 lemon 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.239
 I used approximately as 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.000
 the size of my hand that is not so 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.890
 big or a little less ginger what 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.670
 which I have chopped it in this finite way 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.610
 and like 5 lemons or they can throw more and 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.220
 he will also need honey 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 this honey that I have here and the only thing 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.570
 what I'm going to do is mix this in a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.050
 glass bowl the ginger the kiÃ³n and the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.000
 honey and we're going to mix it and this is going to 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.210
 let it marinate and we will keep it in its 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.060
 fridge because like this is a product 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.120

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 time around that I had just what 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.710

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.320
 because the properties of ginger are 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.000

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.540

 antidepressant that I can tell you more and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.180
 It has high properties especially 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.540
 Expectorant if your child has a cold 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.690
 immune system is very good since 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.300

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.039
 strengthen your immune system with 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.770
 Ginger can do it this way 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.869
 I'm going to mix this and the only thing they 're going to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.030

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.840
 save in this in this little pot of 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 glass tapadito I will not have like this 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920
 guardadito and my refrigerator and when you 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.270

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.120
 throat is a little bit like that by the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.150
 climate change but I'm taking the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.260
 ginger and it has helped me a lot 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.330
 you every time you feel that the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.580

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.940

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.340
 What I also do is prepare myself a 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.360

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.709
 to sweeten since this has honey and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.670

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.340
