00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.390
 Let's prepare the play piece for a 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.730
 adult detach the bases of the frames 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.669

 scalloped scissors stick the labels 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.990
 in the frames and choose the 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.300
 color of your army 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.220
 distribute 40 pieces of your army in the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.220
 four first rows on its side of the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.529
 tray facing you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.270
 the other player must do the same 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.260
 position your parts so 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.000
 strategic 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.400
 seeking to protect his prisoner and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 redeem what is with your opponent 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.610
 two pieces can not occupy the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.950
 even space begins the combat the player 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.110
 this first step in each 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.060
 each player can only move one 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.210
 piece and only one house 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.230
 the movement may be forward to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.810
 behind and to the sides will not walk in the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.440
 diagonal or jump a piece or split 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 a house you can move one 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.520
 alternately forward and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.700
 behind or to one side or the other 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.490
 but for only three consecutive rounds 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.590
 the lakes on the board are neutral houses 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.700
 not allowing you to walk with the pieces 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.890
 about them 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.450
 the prisoner and the land mines 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.700
 can be moved 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.890
 the soldier can walk as many houses 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.990
 I want it as long as I do not attack it 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.570
 round that walked over a house 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.030
 but attention walking more than one house your 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.310
 adversary may perceive that this piece is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.070
 a soldier when he wants to attack someone 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.260
 your part should be at the front 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.450
 or behind the opposing piece to be 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.700
 attacked 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.479
 each piece has a degree of strength and a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.479
 certain amount 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.460
 to duel position in your piece in the same 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 home than the opponent's 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.840
 the two show their pieces and whoever has 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.000
 the strongest piece with the numbering of 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.930
 written on the larger piece wins the battle 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.510
 defeated player leaves the game if both 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.970
 parts have the same force the two come out 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.100
 about the game 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.760
 the secret agent is the smaller piece 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.650
 force 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 but is the only one able to eliminate the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.050
 general who has greater strength but 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.230
 general first attack the secret agent 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.390
 which is eliminated if any part attacks 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.360
 landmine it is eliminated from the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.880
 game and the landmine is also withdrawn 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.650
 cables are the only ones capable of 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.280
 to deactivate landmines 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.200
 taking out of the game the first army 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.130
 who can rescue the prisoner who 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.019
 is with the opponent won the fight 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.180
 if one of the armies is left with only 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.360
 landmines and with the prisoner and 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.640
 he will be defeated strategic tips 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.300
 to distribute their parts in the field of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.579
 battle 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.680
 protect your prisoner by placing a 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.530
 of the corners and surrounding with mines 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.180
 land and leave the rest of mines 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.590
 lands scattered across the board 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 to foil the opponent 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.829
 put soldiers on the front line 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.560
 because this way you will find out soon 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.600
 the opponent's strategy 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.730
 You can also leave the most 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.709
 strong in the front row but runs 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.200
 the risk of losing them early in the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.810
 game and stay without attack 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.549
 It's interesting that the cars stay on the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.040
 because they are the only ones who 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.670
 destroy landmines 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.630
 the carton contains a tray 40 pieces 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.120
