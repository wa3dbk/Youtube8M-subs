yeah<00:06:23.670> and<00:06:23.790> how<00:06:23.880> much<00:06:24.090> difference<00:06:24.750> will<00:06:24.930> the

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
yeah and how much difference will the

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.880 
yeah and how much difference will the
new<00:06:25.170> trams<00:06:25.470> make<00:06:27.200> well<00:06:28.200> they<00:06:28.290> will<00:06:28.680> make<00:06:28.860> a

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
new trams make well they will make a

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.590 
new trams make well they will make a
difference<00:06:29.340> they're<00:06:29.610> much<00:06:29.880> bigger<00:06:30.270> than<00:06:30.450> the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
difference they're much bigger than the

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.570 
difference they're much bigger than the
old<00:06:30.630> trams<00:06:31.110> at<00:06:31.290> least<00:06:31.500> as<00:06:31.710> we<00:06:32.100> said<00:06:32.310> they<00:06:32.460> can

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
old trams at least as we said they can

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.040 
old trams at least as we said they can
carry<00:06:32.820> more<00:06:33.000> passengers<00:06:33.270> they<00:06:33.750> have<00:06:33.870> better

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
carry more passengers they have better

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.380 
carry more passengers they have better
acceleration<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:35.220> there's<00:06:35.760> going<00:06:35.850> to<00:06:35.910> be<00:06:35.970> 20

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
acceleration and there's going to be 20

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.660 
acceleration and there's going to be 20
of<00:06:36.540> them<00:06:36.690> instead<00:06:36.960> of<00:06:37.110> 16<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:38.280> that<00:06:38.340> obviously

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
of them instead of 16 and that obviously

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.840 
of them instead of 16 and that obviously
means<00:06:39.150> that<00:06:39.420> they<00:06:40.380> can<00:06:40.590> now<00:06:40.740> introduce<00:06:40.980> what

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
means that they can now introduce what

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.820 
means that they can now introduce what
they<00:06:42.240> try<00:06:42.540> to<00:06:42.600> introduce<00:06:42.900> when<00:06:43.380> the<00:06:43.530> trams

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
they try to introduce when the trams

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.580 
they try to introduce when the trams
were<00:06:44.040> first<00:06:44.570> came<00:06:45.570> on<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:45.870> tracks<00:06:46.140> that's<00:06:46.440> at

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
were first came on the tracks that's at

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.530 
were first came on the tracks that's at
six<00:06:46.950> minutes<00:06:47.340> serve<00:06:47.490> as<00:06:47.640> a<00:06:47.670> tram<00:06:48.000> every<00:06:48.300> six

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
six minutes serve as a tram every six

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.850 
six minutes serve as a tram every six
minutes<00:06:48.870> they'll<00:06:48.990> be<00:06:49.020> doing<00:06:49.290> that<00:06:49.380> all<00:06:49.590> day

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
minutes they'll be doing that all day

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.440 
minutes they'll be doing that all day
they<00:06:50.280> can<00:06:50.520> do<00:06:50.670> it<00:06:50.760> at<00:06:50.850> peak<00:06:51.000> time<00:06:51.240> at<00:06:51.390> the

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
they can do it at peak time at the

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.300 
they can do it at peak time at the
moment<00:06:51.780> but<00:06:51.930> I<00:06:52.170> think<00:06:52.440> central<00:06:52.740> wants<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.160> see

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
moment but I think central wants to see

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.360 
moment but I think central wants to see
that<00:06:53.340> happen<00:06:53.490> all<00:06:54.000> day<00:06:54.720> long<00:06:54.960> as<00:06:55.830> far<00:06:56.100> as<00:06:56.220> the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
that happen all day long as far as the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.490 
that happen all day long as far as the
buses<00:06:56.640> are<00:06:57.030> concerned<00:06:57.480> listeners<00:06:58.080> to<00:06:58.230> a<00:06:58.260> BBC

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500

buses are concerned listeners to a BBC
WM<00:06:59.160> this<00:06:59.340> morning<00:06:59.730> was<00:07:00.120> still<00:07:00.420> worried<00:07:00.810> about

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
WM this morning was still worried about

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.290 
WM this morning was still worried about
the<00:07:01.410> issue<00:07:01.560> of<00:07:01.980> reliability<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:03.210> the<00:07:03.330> service

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
the issue of reliability of the service

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.070 
the issue of reliability of the service
yeah<00:07:06.300> that<00:07:06.480> is<00:07:06.600> an<00:07:06.750> issue

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
yeah that is an issue

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.690 
yeah that is an issue
just<00:07:07.410> have<00:07:07.560> a<00:07:07.590> look<00:07:07.770> over<00:07:07.920> here<00:07:08.010> we've<00:07:08.280> got<00:07:08.430> one

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
just have a look over here we've got one

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.670 
just have a look over here we've got one
of<00:07:08.820> the<00:07:08.880> new<00:07:09.030> single<00:07:09.480> decker<00:07:09.660> buses<00:07:10.110> 20<00:07:10.440> more

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
of the new single decker buses 20 more

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.560 
of the new single decker buses 20 more
of<00:07:10.710> these<00:07:10.920> will<00:07:11.250> come<00:07:11.490> to<00:07:11.910> the<00:07:12.000> West<00:07:12.180> Midlands

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
of these will come to the West Midlands

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.100 
of these will come to the West Midlands
over<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:12.990> next<00:07:13.140> few<00:07:13.350> months<00:07:13.500> and<00:07:13.770> of<00:07:14.610> course

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
over the next few months and of course

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.660 
over the next few months and of course
300<00:07:16.110> in<00:07:16.320> total<00:07:16.740> over<00:07:16.920> the<00:07:17.070> next<00:07:17.370> five<00:07:17.640> years

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670 
300 in total over the next five years

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.180 
300 in total over the next five years
but<00:07:18.260> reliability<00:07:19.260> is<00:07:19.410> still<00:07:19.620> an<00:07:19.710> issue<00:07:19.830> any

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
but reliability is still an issue any

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.860 
but reliability is still an issue any
more<00:07:20.430> bus<00:07:20.700> lanes<00:07:21.060> that's<00:07:21.330> what<00:07:21.480> many<00:07:21.690> people

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
more bus lanes that's what many people

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.660 
more bus lanes that's what many people
say<00:07:22.050> many<00:07:22.500> more<00:07:22.650> priority<00:07:23.160> measures<00:07:23.490> could

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
say many more priority measures could

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.460 
say many more priority measures could
ultimately<00:07:23.790> if<00:07:24.480> buses<00:07:24.900> get<00:07:25.020> caught<00:07:25.260> in<00:07:25.410> the

ultimately if buses get caught in the
same<00:07:25.650> congestion<00:07:26.310> as

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
same congestion as
