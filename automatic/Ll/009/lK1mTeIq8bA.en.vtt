00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
but it's nice to see that this game

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.969 
but it's nice to see that this game
didn't<00:01:23.490> cause<00:01:23.729> any<00:01:24.060> pain<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> last<00:01:25.590> one

didn't cause any pain like the last one
now<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.729> assumed<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:28.020> seeing<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
now I assumed after seeing the game of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
now I assumed after seeing the game of
darts<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.610> every<00:01:29.970> episode<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
darts that every episode would have like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
darts that every episode would have like
an<00:01:31.979> aspect<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.850> pain<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.869> torture<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.530> when

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
an aspect of pain and torture like when

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
an aspect of pain and torture like when
I<00:01:34.740> saw<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> balls<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> hearts<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.090> there

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I saw the balls with the hearts in there

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
I saw the balls with the hearts in there
I<00:01:36.450> originally<00:01:37.110> thought<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.470> okay<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.950> they

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I originally thought like okay if they

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
I originally thought like okay if they
get<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> strike<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.270> affect<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
get the strike is going to affect the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
get the strike is going to affect the
other<00:01:39.869> person<00:01:40.350> health<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> some<00:01:41.009> way<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.579> no

blew<00:01:49.500> my<00:01:49.649> mind<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.909> fact<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> she

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
blew my mind but just the fact that she

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
blew my mind but just the fact that she
was<00:01:51.810> willing<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> change<00:01:52.680> her<00:01:53.130> appearance<00:01:53.780> for

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
was willing to change her appearance for

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
was willing to change her appearance for
the<00:01:54.840> guy<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.619> she<00:01:55.890> loved<00:01:56.250> since<00:01:56.790> she<00:01:57.000> was

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the guy that she loved since she was

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.100 
the guy that she loved since she was
young<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.219> notice<00:02:00.060> her<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.540> can

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
young just so he can notice her I can

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
young just so he can notice her I can
kind<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> say<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.490> mean<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.509> sure

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
kind of say that I mean I'm not sure

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
kind of say that I mean I'm not sure
that's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.930> good<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> bad<00:02:04.590> thing<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's a good thing or a bad thing but

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.059 
that's a good thing or a bad thing but
in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> end<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.780> did<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.290> each<00:02:07.469> other<00:02:07.680> still

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
in the end they did get each other still

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
in the end they did get each other still
but<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> goes<00:02:08.789> against<00:02:09.330> everything<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
but that goes against everything that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.970 
but that goes against everything that
I've<00:02:10.950> learned<00:02:11.310> up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
I've learned up

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.280 
I've learned up
-<00:02:12.099> now<00:02:12.280> don't<00:02:12.700> change<00:02:13.000> yourself<00:02:13.150> for<00:02:13.750> anyone

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
- now don't change yourself for anyone

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.369 
- now don't change yourself for anyone
but<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.550> situation<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.540> entire<00:02:16.959> scenario

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
but this situation this entire scenario

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.830 
but this situation this entire scenario
I'm<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.280> sure<00:02:18.519> why<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.209> think<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.690> was

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
I'm not sure why but I think it was

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600 
I'm not sure why but I think it was
really<00:02:20.110> sweet<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:21.040> don't<00:02:21.069> see<00:02:21.370> anything

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
really sweet and I don't see anything

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.520 
really sweet and I don't see anything
wrong<00:02:21.879> with<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.120> I'm<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.450> saying<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.080> if

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
wrong with that I'm not saying that if

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.199 
wrong with that I'm not saying that if
your<00:02:23.680> crush<00:02:23.890> likes<00:02:24.220> Chris<00:02:24.580> Brown<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:24.909> should

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
your crush likes Chris Brown you should

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.660 
your crush likes Chris Brown you should
transform<00:02:25.780> yourself<00:02:26.200> into<00:02:26.290> Chris<00:02:26.980> Brown<00:02:27.310> no

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
transform yourself into Chris Brown no

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.110 
transform yourself into Chris Brown no
but<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:29.379> know<00:02:29.650> why<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.819> seemed

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
but I don't know why but it just seemed

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.449 
but I don't know why but it just seemed
right<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.140> seemed<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.590> fit<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.280> was

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
right it just seemed to fit so it was

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.850 
right it just seemed to fit so it was
very<00:02:33.790> sweet<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.299> my<00:02:34.420> opinion<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.019> they<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
very sweet in my opinion that they had a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.759 
very sweet in my opinion that they had a
date<00:02:36.220> after<00:02:36.489> they<00:02:36.790> were<00:02:36.910> dead<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.769> deccan

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
date after they were dead and deccan

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.130 
date after they were dead and deccan
with<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.129> five<00:02:39.519> minute<00:02:40.060> troll<00:02:40.450> though<00:02:40.840> he

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
with that five minute troll though he

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.990 
with that five minute troll though he
doesn't<00:02:41.470> smile<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.040> he<00:02:42.129> can<00:02:42.280> certainly<00:02:42.610> make

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
doesn't smile but he can certainly make

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.910 
doesn't smile but he can certainly make
a<00:02:43.030> joke<00:02:43.329> or<00:02:43.540> two<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.170> would<00:02:44.349> like<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.709> think

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
a joke or two but I would like to think

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.910 
a joke or two but I would like to think
that<00:02:45.099> he<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:46.000> infatuated<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:47.079> her<00:02:47.410> not

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that he was infatuated with her not

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.309 
that he was infatuated with her not
because<00:02:48.239> she<00:02:49.239> had<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.599> face<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:49.870> his

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
because she had the face of his

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.390 
because she had the face of his
childhood<00:02:50.859> friend<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.859> he

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
childhood friend but I think that he

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.940 
childhood friend but I think that he
realized<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.930> stuff<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.500> she<00:02:56.680> went

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
realized the the stuff that she went

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.280 
realized the the stuff that she went
through<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.790> noticed<00:02:58.359> by<00:02:58.629> him<00:02:58.900> that's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
through just to be noticed by him that's

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.410 
through just to be noticed by him that's
why<00:02:59.859> I<00:02:59.890> would<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.700> believe<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.000> he

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
why I would like to believe that he

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.780 
why I would like to believe that he
actually<00:03:02.049> likes<00:03:02.290> her<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.680> well<00:03:02.980> because<00:03:03.400> if<00:03:03.640> he

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
actually likes her as well because if he

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.190 
actually likes her as well because if he
likes<00:03:04.000> her<00:03:04.150> just<00:03:04.329> because<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.690> her<00:03:04.750> face

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
likes her just because of her face

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.890 
likes her just because of her face
that'll<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.620> bullshit<00:03:06.129> but<00:03:06.370> he<00:03:06.609> truly<00:03:07.569> deep

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
that'll be bullshit but he truly deep

had like the demonic mask and the other

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.250 
had like the demonic mask and the other
guy<00:03:36.160> he<00:03:36.489> had<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:37.090> pure<00:03:37.450> white<00:03:37.840> mask

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
guy he had the pure white mask

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.470 
guy he had the pure white mask
symbolizing<00:03:39.130> reincarnation<00:03:39.639> and<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:40.299> this

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
symbolizing reincarnation and in this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.400 
symbolizing reincarnation and in this
episode<00:03:41.109> they<00:03:41.739> both<00:03:42.190> had<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.359> white<00:03:43.599> mask<00:03:43.959> so

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
episode they both had the white mask so

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.559 
episode they both had the white mask so
I<00:03:44.590> mean<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:45.130> guess<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.700> will<00:03:45.790> make<00:03:46.000> sense<00:03:46.269> for

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
I mean I guess it will make sense for

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.970 
I mean I guess it will make sense for
both<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.930> them<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.230> be<00:03:47.349> able<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.739> be

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
both of them to be able to be

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.129 
both of them to be able to be
reincarnated<00:03:48.250> because<00:03:48.970> I'm<00:03:49.150> pretty<00:03:49.329> sure<00:03:49.450> out

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
reincarnated because I'm pretty sure out

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.289 
reincarnated because I'm pretty sure out
of<00:03:50.410> all<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.980> couples<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.459> come<00:03:51.819> there<00:03:52.090> or

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
of all the couples that come there or

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.479 
of all the couples that come there or
all<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.720> friends<00:03:53.410> or<00:03:53.530> whatever<00:03:54.040> I'm<00:03:54.280> pretty

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
all the friends or whatever I'm pretty

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.339 
all the friends or whatever I'm pretty
sure<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:54.940> has<00:03:55.090> been<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.450> case<00:03:55.660> where<00:03:55.690> both<00:03:56.200> of

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
sure that has been a case where both of

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.830 
sure that has been a case where both of
them<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:56.769> been<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.280> Saints<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.660> not

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
them have been just Saints and have not

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.449 
them have been just Saints and have not
done<00:03:59.079> anything<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.799> screw<00:04:00.010> each<00:04:00.099> other<00:04:00.310> over

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
done anything to screw each other over

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.030 
done anything to screw each other over
so<00:04:01.150> both<00:04:01.389> of<00:04:01.419> them<00:04:01.629> deserve<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.859> be

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
so both of them deserve to be

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.740 
so both of them deserve to be
reincarnated<00:04:03.400> because<00:04:03.940> it'll<00:04:04.209> be<00:04:04.299> bullshit

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
reincarnated because it'll be bullshit

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.800 
reincarnated because it'll be bullshit
if<00:04:04.930> out<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.739> every<00:04:06.129> couple<00:04:06.579> you<00:04:07.000> have<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.540> send

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
if out of every couple you have to send

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.180 
if out of every couple you have to send
one<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.169> the<00:04:08.199> boy<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.739> would<00:04:09.010> like<00:04:09.129> to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
one to the boy so I would like to

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.220 
one to the boy so I would like to
believe<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.639> they<00:04:09.879> both<00:04:10.090> got<00:04:10.389> reincarnated

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
believe that they both got reincarnated

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.979 
believe that they both got reincarnated
in<00:04:11.379> this<00:04:11.530> episode<00:04:12.069> but<00:04:12.430> next<00:04:12.730> episode<00:04:13.359> they

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
in this episode but next episode they

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.710 
in this episode but next episode they
don't<00:04:14.169> seem<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.709> be<00:04:15.040> so<00:04:15.280> lucky<00:04:15.489> because<00:04:15.760> it's

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
don't seem to be so lucky because it's

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.569 
don't seem to be so lucky because it's
called<00:04:17.019> death<00:04:17.380> arcade<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.070> believe<00:04:18.370> and

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
called death arcade I believe and

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.430
