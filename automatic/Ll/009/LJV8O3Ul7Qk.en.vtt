our<00:00:36.329> experiment<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.500> had<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.980> some

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
our experiment we had to do some

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.660 
our experiment we had to do some
research<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.850> why<00:00:39.030> onions<00:00:39.510> makers<00:00:40.020> cry<00:00:40.399> in<00:00:41.399> the

therefore<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> onion<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.440> cut<00:00:49.680> does

therefore the way the onion is cut does

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.029 
therefore the way the onion is cut does
not<00:00:50.190> prevent<00:00:50.550> crying<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:52.320> inside<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> the

sharper and more pungent flavor we

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
sharper and more pungent flavor we
decided<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.549> yellow<00:01:35.850> onions<00:01:36.329> since<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> is

decided to use yellow onions since it is

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.080 
decided to use yellow onions since it is
the<00:01:37.049> type<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.500> onion<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.979> used<00:01:38.189> most<00:01:38.490> often<00:01:38.759> in

cooking in our first trial we attempted

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.679 
cooking in our first trial we attempted

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to cut the onion normally the next trial

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.719 
to cut the onion normally the next trial
we<00:01:45.899> tested<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.710> chewing<00:01:47.189> gamma<00:01:47.460> help

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we tested to see if chewing gamma help

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.780 
we tested to see if chewing gamma help
prevent<00:01:48.210> crying<00:01:48.630> while<00:01:48.930> cutting<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.409> onion

prevent crying while cutting an onion

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.300 
prevent crying while cutting an onion
after<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.840> set<00:01:52.110> candles<00:01:52.680> next<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> the

after that we set candles next to the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
after that we set candles next to the
cutting<00:01:53.640> board<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.780> could

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
prevent tears of course we did not do

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.940 
prevent tears of course we did not do
each<00:02:05.159> trial<00:02:05.640> once<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.719> multiple<00:02:07.320> times<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
each trial once but multiple times to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
each trial once but multiple times to
see<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.190> each<00:02:08.429> outcome<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.360> accurate

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
see if each outcome was accurate

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
see if each outcome was accurate
our<00:02:10.979> dagger<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.700> quite<00:02:12.030> exciting

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
our dagger was quite exciting

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
our dagger was quite exciting
were<00:02:13.560> able<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> prevent<00:02:14.310> crying<00:02:14.730> during<00:02:15.270> our

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
were able to prevent crying during our

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.920 
were able to prevent crying during our
trials<00:02:16.370> shown<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> graph<00:02:18.000> each<00:02:18.450> tile

trials shown in the graph each tile

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.230 
trials shown in the graph each tile
allowed<00:02:19.380> less<00:02:19.740> tears<00:02:20.130> than<00:02:20.490> just<00:02:20.760> cutting<00:02:21.060> an

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
allowed less tears than just cutting an

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.380 
allowed less tears than just cutting an
onion<00:02:21.360> normally<00:02:22.220> gun<00:02:23.220> prevented<00:02:23.790> crying<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
onion normally gun prevented crying the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.660 
onion normally gun prevented crying the
least<00:02:24.630> while<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> candles<00:02:25.950> next<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
least while the candles next to the

least while the candles next to the
cutting<00:02:27.000> board<00:02:27.030> did<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> best<00:02:28.020> job<00:02:28.170> of

cutting board did the best job of

cutting board did the best job of
preventing<00:02:28.920> tears<00:02:33.410> therefore<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.830> can

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
preventing tears therefore we can

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.860 
preventing tears therefore we can
successfully<00:02:35.460> say<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.570> myth<00:02:36.840> is

successfully say that this myth is
busted

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
crying maybe it is something simple and

it<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.940> better<00:03:06.210> than<00:03:06.480> wearing<00:03:06.750> swim<00:03:07.260> goggles

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
it is better than wearing swim goggles
