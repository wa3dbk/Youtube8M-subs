00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.470 

when<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.000> put<00:00:03.270> on<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.689> single<00:00:04.170> string<00:00:05.480> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
when you put on a single string the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.419 
when you put on a single string the
first<00:00:06.750> thing<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.109> need<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.440> look<00:00:07.560> at<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.980> to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
first thing you need to look at is to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.400 
first thing you need to look at is to
make<00:00:08.910> sure<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> string<00:00:09.870> has<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> really

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
make sure that the string has a really

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.120 
make sure that the string has a really
clear<00:00:10.710> path<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:15.480> string<00:00:15.859> you<00:00:16.859> know<00:00:16.980> it

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
clear path so the string you know it

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.950 
clear path so the string you know it
obviously<00:00:17.550> starts<00:00:17.699> down<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.449> by<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> tail

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
obviously starts down here by the tail

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
obviously starts down here by the tail
piece<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.800> fine<00:00:20.160> tuning<00:00:20.490> loudly<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
piece this is a fine tuning loudly so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
piece this is a fine tuning loudly so
the<00:00:21.800> string<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:22.980> fitted<00:00:23.460> into<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the string would be fitted into the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
the string would be fitted into the
finetuner<00:00:24.090> other<00:00:24.840> tell<00:00:25.170> view<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.830> also

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
finetuner other tell view you can also

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.609 
finetuner other tell view you can also
get<00:00:26.250> wooden<00:00:26.970> tile<00:00:27.180> pieces<00:00:27.480> without<00:00:27.779> fine<00:00:28.199> tuna

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
get wooden tile pieces without fine tuna

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
get wooden tile pieces without fine tuna
and<00:00:31.279> it's<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.550> important<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.450> string

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and it's just important that the string

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
and it's just important that the string
firstly<00:00:34.559> has<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> clear<00:00:35.010> path<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.489> also<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
firstly has a clear path but also that

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
firstly has a clear path but also that
it<00:00:36.200> that<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> runs<00:00:37.500> smoothly<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.550> used

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it that it runs smoothly so you used

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
it that it runs smoothly so you used
loop<00:00:39.239> lubricant<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.170> graphite<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.160> that's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
loop lubricant like graphite and that's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
loop lubricant like graphite and that's
just<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> fancy<00:00:42.210> name<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.600> using<00:00:43.530> pencil<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
just a fancy name for using pencil a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.350 
just a fancy name for using pencil a
soft<00:00:44.640> pencil<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.820> sure<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
soft pencil and you make sure that the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.880 
soft pencil and you make sure that the
pegs<00:00:48.600> work<00:00:48.870> very<00:00:49.170> nicely<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.890> smoothly<00:00:51.890> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
pegs work very nicely and smoothly so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.060 
pegs work very nicely and smoothly so
firstly<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.850> some<00:00:54.090> graphite<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.770> using

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
firstly put some graphite in here using

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.720 
firstly put some graphite in here using
a<00:00:56.989> pencil<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.530> using<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> normal<00:00:59.550> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
a pencil I'm just using it normal it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.299 
a pencil I'm just using it normal it's
actually<00:01:00.030> HB<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> softer<00:01:01.890> pencils

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
actually HB a probably a softer pencils

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.530 
actually HB a probably a softer pencils
better<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.440 

graphite<00:01:12.380> into<00:01:12.620> there<00:01:12.980> and<00:01:13.820> also<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
graphite into there and also on the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.350 
graphite into there and also on the
bridge<00:01:14.660> so<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.670> already<00:01:16.850> has<00:01:16.970> some

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
bridge so this one already has some

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.020 
bridge so this one already has some
graphite<00:01:17.750> on<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.470> might<00:01:19.010> as<00:01:19.070> well<00:01:19.310> put

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
graphite on it but I might as well put

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.820 
graphite on it but I might as well put
on<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.180> little<00:01:20.480> bit<00:01:20.660> more<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:26.320> always<00:01:27.320> like<00:01:27.800> to

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
on a little bit more I always like to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.950 
on a little bit more I always like to
try<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.490> make<00:01:29.210> sure<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.070> don't<00:01:31.340> draw<00:01:31.960> all

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
try and make sure that I don't draw all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.720 
try and make sure that I don't draw all
over<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.440> bridge<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.160> doesn't<00:01:34.460> make<00:01:34.550> it

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
over the bridge it just doesn't make it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.720 
over the bridge it just doesn't make it
look<00:01:34.850> very<00:01:35.090> nice<00:01:36.100> usually<00:01:37.100> else<00:01:37.280> they<00:01:37.490> put<00:01:37.700> a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
look very nice usually else they put a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.830 
look very nice usually else they put a
little<00:01:37.940> bit<00:01:38.120> of<00:01:38.210> grease<00:01:38.510> on<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.870> finetuner<00:01:39.490> so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
little bit of grease on the finetuner so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.290 
little bit of grease on the finetuner so
like<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.020> munching<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.680> up<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:44.060> got<00:01:44.270> a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
like this munching it up just got a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.260 
like this munching it up just got a
little<00:01:44.420> job<00:01:44.920> grace<00:01:45.920> yeah<00:01:46.340> just<00:01:46.700> put<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.970> tiny

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
little job grace yeah just put a tiny

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:58.750 
little job grace yeah just put a tiny
bit<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.810> tip<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.230> don't<00:01:48.440> need<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.620> lot<00:01:57.760> and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
bit on the tip you don't need a lot and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.610 
bit on the tip you don't need a lot and
then<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.060> final<00:01:59.480> thing<00:01:59.510> is<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.870> put<00:02:00.170> some<00:02:00.350> pig

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
then the final thing is to put some pig

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.070 
then the final thing is to put some pig
paste<00:02:00.920> onto<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.490> pig<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:03.760> use<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.030> hill<00:02:05.660> style

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
paste onto the pig I use the hill style

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.780 
paste onto the pig I use the hill style
peg<00:02:06.410> paste<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:07.040> comes<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.149> little<00:02:08.300> tube<00:02:09.790> like

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
peg paste it comes in a little tube like

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.060 
peg paste it comes in a little tube like
this<00:02:10.820> looks<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.510> little<00:02:11.600> bit<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:11.960> lipstick<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
this looks a little bit like lipstick I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.110 
this looks a little bit like lipstick I
guess<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.920> been<00:02:16.160> around<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.640> ages

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
guess it's been around for ages

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.230 
guess it's been around for ages
I<00:02:17.680> remember<00:02:18.680> my<00:02:18.830> father<00:02:19.070> using<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
I remember my father using this in the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.340 
I remember my father using this in the
70s<00:02:22.090> whose<00:02:23.090> rep<00:02:23.330> slightly<00:02:23.810> different<00:02:24.200> back

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
70s whose rep slightly different back

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.410 
70s whose rep slightly different back
then<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.580> basically<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> same

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
then but it's basically the same

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.900 
then but it's basically the same
composition<00:02:27.140> grass<00:02:27.860> tram<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.340> cornice<00:02:28.700> was

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
composition grass tram a cornice was

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:49.160 
composition grass tram a cornice was
more<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.300> graffiti<00:02:30.040> style

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.809 

okay<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> put<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> peg<00:02:50.910> back<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
okay now you put the peg back in and the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.110 
okay now you put the peg back in and the
idea<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> stream<00:02:58.170> has<00:02:58.650> no<00:02:59.130> king<00:02:59.610> set

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
idea is that the stream has no king set

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.730 
idea is that the stream has no king set
at<00:03:00.450> any<00:03:00.600> spot<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.860> do<00:03:02.459> have<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.760> check<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
at any spot so you do have to check that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.290 
at any spot so you do have to check that
because<00:03:04.740> if<00:03:04.860> there's<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.160> kink<00:03:05.520> or<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
because if there's a kink or if it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.100 
because if there's a kink or if it
touches<00:03:06.570> another<00:03:06.959> peg<00:03:08.840> sometimes<00:03:09.840> she<00:03:09.990> can

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
touches another peg sometimes she can

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.680 
touches another peg sometimes she can
get<00:03:10.230> sharp<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.860> kinks<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.180> here<00:03:12.540> at

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
get sharp like kinks just just here at

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.729 
get sharp like kinks just just here at
the<00:03:12.870> nut<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:14.390> otherwise<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.810> sometimes<00:03:16.350> one

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the nut and otherwise that sometimes one

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.729 
the nut and otherwise that sometimes one
string<00:03:17.160> will<00:03:17.540> touch<00:03:18.540> another<00:03:18.930> peg<00:03:19.319> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
string will touch another peg and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.780 
string will touch another peg and
there's<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.360> not<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:23.040> creates<00:03:23.459> extra

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
there's that's just not it creates extra

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.449 
there's that's just not it creates extra
friction<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> string<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:26.220> just

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
friction for the string and it just

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.130 
friction for the string and it just
means<00:03:26.670> your<00:03:26.880> string<00:03:27.120> might<00:03:27.330> last<00:03:27.600> quite<00:03:27.989> as

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
means your string might last quite as

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.020 
means your string might last quite as
long<00:03:28.230> will<00:03:28.739> unravel<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.700> particular

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
long will unravel in that particular

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.590 
long will unravel in that particular
spot<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.709> first<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.160> all<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:37.080> string

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
spot so first of all you put the string

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.900 
spot so first of all you put the string
into<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:41.690> tailpiece<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:44.250> might<00:03:44.430> also<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
into the tailpiece you might also have a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.759 
into the tailpiece you might also have a
different<00:03:45.180> style<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.900> tail<00:03:46.170> pick<00:03:46.440> say<00:03:46.709> you

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
different style of tail pick say you

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.400 
different style of tail pick say you
have<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> wooden<00:03:47.340> style<00:03:47.700> towel<00:03:48.030> piece<00:03:48.410> like

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
have a wooden style towel piece like

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.580 
have a wooden style towel piece like
this<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.630> string<00:03:51.900> would<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.290> go<00:03:52.470> and

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
this it this string would just go and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.490 
this it this string would just go and
live<00:03:52.800> through<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.510> same<00:03:54.510> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.350> know

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
live through the same kind of you know

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.970 
live through the same kind of you know
same<00:03:55.890> kind<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.190> way<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.519> goes<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.880> underneath

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
same kind of way it goes in underneath

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.949 
same kind of way it goes in underneath
but<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.430> case<00:03:59.700> I'm<00:03:59.940> using<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.360> fine-tuning

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
but in this case I'm using a fine-tuning

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.000 
but in this case I'm using a fine-tuning
tail<00:04:01.260> piece<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:04.530> pop<00:04:04.860> it

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
tail piece so here it is so you pop it

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.360 
tail piece so here it is so you pop it
in<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.370> make<00:04:05.880> sure<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.900> it's<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:08.100> right

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
in and make sure that it's in the right

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.170 
in and make sure that it's in the right
ways<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:09.780> want<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> line<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.060> it

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
ways you want it to line up so that it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
ways you want it to line up so that it
sits<00:04:12.870> like<00:04:15.109> this<00:04:16.109> underneath<00:04:18.709> move<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.890> over

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
sits like this underneath move it over

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.830 
sits like this underneath move it over
the<00:04:20.220> bridge<00:04:21.590> over<00:04:22.590> there<00:04:22.710> not<00:04:23.419> now<00:04:24.419> this<00:04:24.660> is

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
the bridge over there not now this is

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.140 
the bridge over there not now this is
the<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:26.070> know<00:04:26.190> there's<00:04:26.370> lots<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.700> different

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the you know there's lots of different

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.909 
the you know there's lots of different
techniques<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:28.220> how<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:30.320> how<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.350> put<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> string

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
techniques of how to how to put a string

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.020 
techniques of how to how to put a string
in<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> way<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.370> do<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:35.030> just

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
in the way I do it is like this just

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.440 
in the way I do it is like this just
trying<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.330> make<00:04:36.479> sure<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:36.810> get<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:40.410> just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
trying to make sure I get that so just

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.490 
trying to make sure I get that so just
pop<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.660> string<00:04:42.960> into<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.410> hole

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
pop the string into the hole

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.659 
pop the string into the hole
turn<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.710> around<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.220> time

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.349 

and<00:04:50.669> then<00:04:51.679> live<00:04:52.679> it<00:04:52.889> all<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:53.459> way<00:04:53.609> to<00:04:54.029> the<00:04:54.179> edge

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:54.359 
and then live it all the way to the edge

00:04:54.359 --> 00:05:01.909 
and then live it all the way to the edge
of<00:04:54.809> the<00:04:54.989> peg<00:04:55.229> box<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:58.169> way<00:05:00.439> that<00:05:01.439> way<00:05:01.619> the

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
of the peg box that way that way the

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:13.699 
of the peg box that way that way the
string<00:05:02.219> will<00:05:02.819> pull<00:05:03.089> the<00:05:03.269> pig<00:05:03.569> in<00:05:03.839> lips<00:05:12.709> now

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:13.709 
string will pull the pig in lips now

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.919 
string will pull the pig in lips now
it's<00:05:14.549> always<00:05:14.819> worth<00:05:15.089> checking<00:05:15.119> the<00:05:15.719> bridge

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:15.929 
it's always worth checking the bridge

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:19.939 
it's always worth checking the bridge
quickly<00:05:17.059> making<00:05:18.059> sure<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:19.169> it's<00:05:19.349> at<00:05:19.679> a<00:05:19.709> right

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
quickly making sure that it's at a right

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:52.659 
quickly making sure that it's at a right
angle<00:05:20.299> slightly<00:05:21.299> forwards<00:05:51.589> just

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
angle slightly forwards just

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.929 
angle slightly forwards just
double-checking<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.909> bridge<00:05:54.089> again<00:05:55.939> making

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
double-checking the bridge again making

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:00.259 
double-checking the bridge again making
sure<00:05:57.360> that<00:05:57.509> it's<00:05:57.689> straight<00:05:59.029> so<00:06:00.029> there<00:06:00.179> you

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:00.269 
sure that it's straight so there you

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:04.699 
sure that it's straight so there you
have<00:06:00.299> it<00:06:00.509> a<00:06:01.129> new<00:06:02.129> string<00:06:02.549> fittings<00:06:03.179> and<00:06:03.709> you're

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:04.709 
have it a new string fittings and you're

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:13.090 
have it a new string fittings and you're
ready<00:06:04.919> to<00:06:05.009> go

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.160 

you
