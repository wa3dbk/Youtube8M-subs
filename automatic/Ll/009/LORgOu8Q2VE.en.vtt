00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.980
 And then, folks, I'm going to make a 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.709
 both of these lgl 40 from tv 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.099
 This one is a good launch. 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:18.030
 launched here in Brazil practically this 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.940
 line that is one to replace the line 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.040
 lg optimus l 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.930
 this one already comes with the most 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.890
 recent android which is the 4.4 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.749
 it has a 3.5 inch screen 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.809
 comes with a new 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:42.030
 unlock the screen that through some 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.589
 Touch has fm radio camera 3 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.300
 megapixels with what left a little to 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.940
 want and battery than 1,650 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.519
 milliampere hours 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.600
 for being a hungry he still finds himself 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.539
 with price above other releases 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.879
 A little better 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 the differential of this device is that it 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.270
 comes tv and also already comes with android 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.560
 updated 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 so let's open it here 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:34.979
 It's good to be here, not even the normal device . 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.479
 I already know the movie I do not know. 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.840
 they do it here the back camera 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.719
 of 3 megapixels but does not have flash 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:56.099
 it is dual chip and here it has an antenna 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:59.420
 for tv here comes the headset 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:02.220
 single ear itabom input p2 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.890
 normal button on an answering 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.329
 the adapter also comes with the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:19.040
 loader 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:19.040
 usb cable usb cable 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:32.160
 Here you connect the battery to one 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:37.410
 with a capacity of 1,650 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.440
 millionaire hours ago or 1,700 my hour 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:50.670
 So far, this manual is the model 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:53.400
 lg 175 efe okay is the LG BL40 good 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.150
 practically only gave him it the entrance 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.100
 here is dual chip and normal chips are me 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.099
 chipita is not microchip 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.590
 I think this is better than micro 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.920
 chip 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.540
 Let's connect Iraq in the specifications. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.190
 it has a dual core processor is from 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 one point a dual core processor of 1.2 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 ghz and 512 ram memory what I think 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.650
 that's pretty little could be a gig 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 ram and 4g 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.340
 of internal memory, but as we have already 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.340
 know the system takes up some memory 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.390
 will likely become available 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:06.680
 the two gigabytes of good memory 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.849
 I advanced a little video because're always 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:14.019
 delay to switch on the appliance 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:20.870
 especially the first time it is 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:23.260
 connected to portuguese 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.260
 yea 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:48.040
 and jumping for now fable 22 optimus l 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
 40 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.230
 good the screen is in a nice resolution ok 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:20.540
 not so superior to the rest. 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:29.000
 mainly from the top appliances 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:34.340
 however it has a nice sharpness that 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:50.680
 has the interface already has the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:54.050
 lg captures photo here is here is a 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:59.180
 Pretty simple camera 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:04.040
 Do not wait, it's not self-focus. 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:10.780
 do not expect a very good camera to 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.780
 you record the video in simple resolution 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:28.129
 let's see here with this spacing 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:30.249
 Internal available which then 1:56 gigas 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:33.110
 practically is not enough 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:38.539
 applications are probably not 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:42.560
 installed in SD memory is on the card 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:48.939
 extra you even put unless 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.840
 you do latest version of android 4.4.2 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:54.680
 so the staff 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:58.430
 for now this is it if you have any 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.529
 doubt about this device leave there 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:06.439
 comments that I will make some 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:09.379
 test with it and respond after doing 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:12.610
 video trying to respond to the 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.610
 doubts of you 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:21.949
 so that's it I hope you have 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:25.639
 liked it probably here is digital tv 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:28.969
 so here it does not have the signal does not catch if 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:32.800
 does not love logic and that's it I hope 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:32.800
 you liked it, thanks
