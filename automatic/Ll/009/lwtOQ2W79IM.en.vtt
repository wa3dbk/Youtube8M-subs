for<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.450> no<00:03:44.079> there's<00:03:44.919> one<00:03:45.220> sequence<00:03:45.669> in

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
for that no there's one sequence in

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.250 
for that no there's one sequence in
volume<00:03:46.060> 2<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.510> might<00:03:46.660> be<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> little<00:03:46.930> bit<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
volume 2 it might be a little bit of a

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.750 
volume 2 it might be a little bit of a
spoiler<00:03:47.500> but<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.250> big<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.609> deal

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
spoiler but it's not that big of a deal

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370 
spoiler but it's not that big of a deal
because<00:03:48.910> it's<00:03:49.120> not<00:03:49.239> really<00:03:49.480> revealing<00:03:49.810> pot<00:03:50.200> or

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
because it's not really revealing pot or

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.220 
because it's not really revealing pot or
anything<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:52.209> if<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.389> notice<00:03:52.660> he<00:03:53.049> gets

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
anything like if you notice he gets

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.159 
anything like if you notice he gets
captured<00:03:54.010> here<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.669> there's<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.959> some

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
captured here and there's like some

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.339 
captured here and there's like some
mercenary<00:03:56.859> soldiers<00:03:57.340> type<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.510> are<00:03:58.660> that

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
mercenary soldiers type that are that

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.830 
mercenary soldiers type that are that
are<00:03:59.470> basically<00:03:59.739> trying<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.069> cut<00:04:00.280> off<00:04:00.310> his<00:04:00.549> arm

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
are basically trying to cut off his arm

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.930 
are basically trying to cut off his arm
basically<00:04:01.840> what<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.519> gist<00:04:03.519> is<00:04:03.639> that<00:04:03.700> they

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
basically what the gist is that they

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.789 
basically what the gist is that they
capture<00:04:04.359> an<00:04:04.450> enemy<00:04:04.720> agent<00:04:04.870> they<00:04:05.290> chop<00:04:05.590> off

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
capture an enemy agent they chop off

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.680 
capture an enemy agent they chop off
their<00:04:06.010> arms<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.400> legs<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.849> think<00:04:07.389> personally

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
their arms and legs I think personally

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.390 
their arms and legs I think personally
that's<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.840> great<00:04:08.019> idea<00:04:08.139> because<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.889> can't<00:04:09.280> get

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
that's a great idea because it can't get

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.640 
that's a great idea because it can't get
away<00:04:09.780> unfortunately<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:10.900> case<00:04:11.169> they

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
away unfortunately in this case they

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.010 
away unfortunately in this case they
can't<00:04:11.889> cut<00:04:12.099> through<00:04:12.250> his<00:04:12.340> armor<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:15.489> it's

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
can't cut through his armor and so it's

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.320 
can't cut through his armor and so it's
so<00:04:18.020> they<00:04:18.200> cut<00:04:18.380> into<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.590> armor<00:04:18.950> here<00:04:19.220> it's<00:04:20.090> run

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
so they cut into the armor here it's run

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.180 
so they cut into the armor here it's run
away<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.100> we<00:04:22.100> hear<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.580> just<00:04:23.140> it's<00:04:24.140> just<00:04:24.380> chaos

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
away and we hear it just it's just chaos

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
away and we hear it just it's just chaos
you<00:04:25.520> see<00:04:25.730> heads<00:04:26.090> exploding<00:04:26.810> body<00:04:27.260> parts

parts<00:05:09.800> blood<00:05:10.160> everywhere<00:05:10.640> this<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.240> heavy

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
parts blood everywhere this is heavy

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.110 
parts blood everywhere this is heavy
heavy<00:05:11.960> violence<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.890> if<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.700> notice<00:05:13.970> there

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
heavy violence and if you notice there

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.210 
heavy violence and if you notice there
is<00:05:14.210> explicit<00:05:14.480> content<00:05:15.140> and<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.680> explicit

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
is explicit content and that explicit

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.160 
is explicit content and that explicit
content<00:05:16.610> basic<00:05:17.060> ways<00:05:17.240> is<00:05:17.450> blood<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.990> gore<00:05:18.110> and

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
content basic ways is blood and gore and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.770 
content basic ways is blood and gore and
things<00:05:18.530> like<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.920> it's<00:05:19.610> not<00:05:19.850> for<00:05:20.060> kids<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.540> I

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
things like that it's not for kids and I

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.810 
things like that it's not for kids and I
think<00:05:21.140> that<00:05:21.320> even<00:05:21.770> if<00:05:21.950> it's<00:05:22.070> about<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.550> blood

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
think that even if it's about the blood

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.910 
think that even if it's about the blood
this<00:05:23.600> isn't<00:05:23.900> for<00:05:24.050> kids<00:05:24.080> either<00:05:24.410> because<00:05:24.680> kids

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
this isn't for kids either because kids

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.470 
this isn't for kids either because kids
aren't<00:05:25.070> gonna<00:05:25.190> understand<00:05:25.640> this<00:05:25.700> concept<00:05:26.030> of

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
aren't gonna understand this concept of

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.570 
aren't gonna understand this concept of
what's<00:05:27.110> going<00:05:27.290> on<00:05:27.530> here<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.100> then<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.340> fact

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
what's going on here and then the fact

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.000 
what's going on here and then the fact
that<00:05:28.670> it's<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.660> art<00:05:29.930> style<00:05:30.200> it's<00:05:30.470> very<00:05:30.530> adult

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010
