00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.730
 hi to all it's tommy and today 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.310
 we find ourselves for a money saving 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 limited to two players after the 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.690
 day 1.16 so for that it's very 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.510
 simple you invite your friend in your 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 garage you ride in driver on 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.690
 your in your car so what 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 you want to duplicate I advise you 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.210
 do not adhere to what is really more 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.039
 simple to move the rest it's 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.630
 really galley so here is your 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 friend opens the passenger door 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 and then thanks to this one he has inches and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 he pushes your car to the level of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450
 blue dot of the blue red so that's it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 have to push them to the end 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.960
 no I advise you to do a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.100
 canadair because we tried with the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.470
 flirtatious and it was really not 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.559
 easy to move it to the passage for 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.360
 thank mister virtuoso and then his 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 colleague since they are the ones who 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 found the glitch so I think you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 know a little bit of everything 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 So here it is wrong to thank him 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.260
 so here I am I even share this 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 little video so once the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.369
 car is at the level of the blue round 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 your colleague will have to block the door 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.939
 keep blocking the passenger door 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.100
 you come out you shift you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.319
 go back a little bit and then you do 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 triangle to get into the car of the 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.020
 passenger side is important and then 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 you do the right arrow when 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 you see that your character is in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.810
 so go upstairs then to find out 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.159
 if the manipulation has succeeded you ask 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.719
 your friend if he sees you in the car 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 or out if he would like it out is that 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.029
 it did not work 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.649
 so me you could see I asked 

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.849
 twice my friend he told me twice 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.740
 that I was still outside so I 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.139
 tried again and the third time that was 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.749
 market he saw me in so once 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:38.880
 that I am in I can leave I 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:42.079
 can leave the menu and then there what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.119
 I'll have to make his orders and 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 a rebel karin so the case a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.149
 rebel rusty it's important too 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.259
 so you order the frame leads so 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.969
 there you have the time you want a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.000
 do not hurry you order your 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.860
 karine rebels 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 no matter what color you do not care 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.860
 you put it in the place of the car 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.420
 that you want to replace once 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.650
 this is done it will have to redo a 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.940
 previous manipulation 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.800
 so here you go off shifted back 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.869
 from the apod the car and then you 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.709
 redone triangle and then the arrow of 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.850
 right we see you that your 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.230
 character is coming in a 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.970
 again you ask your friend 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.110
 if you see in the car or not so 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.090
 you see in it is that it's good 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.800
 so at that moment if you're not in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.420
 so it's successful and there you 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.530
 can move your adherent with the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 new car that you just 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 commands and therefore the rebel hull and 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.640
 then you start buying yourself a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.739
 rebel column 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.020
 you retreat back into the 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.400
 earth wanting to move on and on and on 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.300
 then you smoke duplicate like that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.770
 as much as you want me I have 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
 duplicate that so that's it for 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.160
 jets for for video so here is so 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.760
 once it's done all your 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.550
 duplication are doing you take the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.830
 original car you go up side 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.420
 Passenger it's important to climb 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.140
 passengers high on the passenger side when 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.450
 me on the video 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.980
 and then you go out your garage after 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.659
 just go back so 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.489
 the video ranking and will continue to 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.379
 turn but hey you'll see that 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.209
 when I go back to the garage my 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.620
 car 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.410
 the original will disappear and then at 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.910
 moment when a rebel is going 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.680
 will be delivered there when you get the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 little message she will reappear 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 so that's it so do not worry 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.410
 so once this is done and well 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.770
 you can go sell the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.270
 duplications at 150 thousand dollars each 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.400
 so buying the square of 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.860
 rebels will allow you to resell them 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.240
 unlimited without limit of expectations so 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.960
 it was a bit interesting so 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.820
 with the by pass 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.140
 so it's interesting do not sell 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.520
 your original as surely you 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.380
 can do them manipulation after 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.030
 what in all cases the original will be 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.320
 the one you sell 700 me so if 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 you see that you sell it 700 miles 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.680
 is that it's the original so we do not 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.840
 the vendÃ©e not where van daelen it depends what 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 that you want to do but the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.930
 duplications will resell it to 150 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.850
 thousand dollars 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.250
 so here is so I thank a new 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.470
 once virtuoso for this to have found 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.300
 the glitch so I hope this sharing 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.920
 you will like me I wanted to call her 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.770

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.750
 post comments like 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.070
 what finally nice difficulty etc 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.870
 I will try to answer the most 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.130
 quickly possible and then I you 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.310
