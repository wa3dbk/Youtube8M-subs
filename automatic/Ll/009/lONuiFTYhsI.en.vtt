00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
right shoe as well these shoes do really

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 
right shoe as well these shoes do really
have<00:01:11.130> major<00:01:12.030> creasing<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.560> actually

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
have major creasing but they actually

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
have major creasing but they actually
the<00:01:14.280> creases<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.560> they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the creases do come out some when they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
the creases do come out some when they
are<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.009> foot<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.960> into

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
are on foot but I will look into

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.100 
are on foot but I will look into
actually<00:01:19.799> removing<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> creases<00:01:20.970> maybe<00:01:21.810> not

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
actually removing the creases maybe not

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.450 
actually removing the creases maybe not
because<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> iron<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:25.220> iron<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
because you know iron in iron and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
because you know iron in iron and
leather<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.509> makes<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.990> thin<00:01:28.350> enough<00:01:28.619> some

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
leather really makes it thin enough some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
leather really makes it thin enough some
and<00:01:29.659> I'm<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.079> sure<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.530> willing

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and I'm not really sure if I'm willing

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.819 
and I'm not really sure if I'm willing
to<00:01:31.860> take<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.220> risk<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.360> anyways<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.680> you
