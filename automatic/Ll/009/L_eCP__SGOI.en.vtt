00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello compadres welcome to the channel 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.929
 fried guns 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.550
 today I have an interesting question 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.960
 Sirs 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.710
 the compadre asks me hey 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.560
 I have two revolvers 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:30.600
 one has a 4-inch barrel the other 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.640
 has an 8-inch cannon 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.079
 if I shoot the same shovel 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.490
 by the two revolvers 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:46.900
 the speed of the bullet is the same 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.000
 or the weapon modifies the speed of the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.610
 bullet 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.060
 That question made me very interesting 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.060
 Sirs 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.260
 it's a very complex answer but it's 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.479
 very very interesting the question 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.310
 we must take into consideration many 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.960
 things 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.770
 in general gentlemen if I shoot this 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.710
 bullet for these two revolvers this 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.189
 revolver is going to shoot the bullet more 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.720
 fast, but there are many 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.390
 variables that they must take for example 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.820
 if when I charge this bullet there is 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.310
 various types of gunpowder 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.060
 there is gunpowder that burns very fast there 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.930
 gunpowder that burns a little more slowly 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.610
 if I use a gunpowder that burns very 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.350
 Quick 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.080
 the pressure that the explosion will exert 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.510
 in the cylinder and in the barrel 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.410
 will generally put the most 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.820
 speed in the first few inches of 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.850
 cannon and the bullet is going to come out extremely 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.440
 Quick 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.280
 in a short-barreled revolver if I use 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 a gunpowder burned more 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.850
 slow or a powder that the granules 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.610
 they sound like flakes or they are a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.990
 little bit bigger than gunpowder 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.660
 it goes slower than gunpowder is going to happen 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.970
 will explode 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.050
 I do not know completely is going to burn 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 when you're coming out of the canyon and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 then the revolver is going to have a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.610
 very big flash but remember that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.880
 the big flash does not push the bullet 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.040
 then when although it looks very 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.460
 impressive that a lot of fire goes out 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.020
 the revolver that's not going to help so 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:03.620
 the bullet has more speed 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.380
 that's why revolvers that have a cannon 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.900
 the longer gunpowder is going to have more 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:15.920
 time to push the bullet and that's why the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.920
 bullet comes out faster but they also have 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.070
 to consider that the longer the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.360
 cannon remember that the canyon has a 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:31.130
 striped inside that scratched makes the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.820
 bullet trip slower then in general 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.730
 if the revolvers with longer barrel goes 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.000
 to get out the bullet faster but there is a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.850
 limit if you put one extremely long in 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.100
 instead of increasing the speed goes to 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.940
 start is like a parable goes to 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.470
 start to slow down but 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 That question made me very interesting 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.200
 know what I'm going to do I'm going to bring a 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.890
 chronograph and we are going to do tests of 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.490
 bullet speed because that 's something that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.070
 it's very interesting when you have 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.910
 and semi-automatic pistols of cannon very 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.190
 short many say no I do not like 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.310
 have guns like this little one 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.530
 cannon very short because the bullet at 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.590
 the speed of the bullet decreases a lot 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.330
 I prefer to have one like this great 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.420
 have a long barrel so that the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.360
 bullet speed and whether it's higher 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.960
 let's do tests with the chronograph 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.220
 to see how much the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.220
 bullet speed 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.460
 let me cut this video let me go to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.190
 bring the chronograph that I bought about 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.560
 months and we're going to make a video with 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.870
 the chronograph now of gentlemen these 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.410
 fried guns there we see you gentlemen 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.410
 goodbye
