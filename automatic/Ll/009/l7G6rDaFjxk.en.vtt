00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 surely the downside is that 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.140
 we have more than everyone's work because 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 we are a very new team on the side 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.990
 positive though looking at the glass 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.820
 half full that we are the one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.940
 potentially can have more margins than 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 improvement and I believe that in this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.199
 moment after nine days 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.990
 our goal is to have no 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
 our starting point of having understood 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 that the furrow of this type of work is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.439
 the right one because we are the team 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 Italian who played more and the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 grit and hunger the application of mine 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.450
 players 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.059
 even in the games so close together 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.860
 I believe that motivation is the most signal 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 nice for for a coach 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 at the same time I know we have so much 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.340
 to work and today in my opinion also in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.510
 non-possession phase 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.989
 we did it in my opinion it's a game 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.600
 very careful we committed one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 distraction that the bologna suffered 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 capitalized on that corner kick 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.500
 that we are a little distracted and it is not 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 the second player, for example, has come out 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.339
 this is a mistake we paid 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.159
 but then I believe that in the arc of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 match the inter did very well 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.560
 I believe that when a boy of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 any age as of 14 years and 19 in 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 a city that is not his without mom and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.799
 dad i think i can say without 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 be denied that I formed the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.850
 my adolescence has been in this city 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 I am bound when I reviewed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.270
 porches I had a moment 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.189
 the only city that certain arcades that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.570
 it rains but not because you take water is one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.040
 what a great thing so i'm tied 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.000
 I'm tied to the people I met 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.530
 many today I met the doctor again 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 cured me of yourself in series a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.990
 thanks to you because he made me stop e 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 then 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.620
 however I love him is obviously a 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.640
 however beaten this 15 I always work in the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.990
 heart 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.580
 there is no particular moment 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.170
 whatever I say, yes, five years 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.160
 I don't know you were you from 14 to 19 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.160
 May you remember
