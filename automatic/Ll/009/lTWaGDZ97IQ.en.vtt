here we combine the heavy shot with a
swivel<00:02:39.450> attack<00:02:39.690> if<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.620> had<00:02:40.739> upgraded<00:02:40.920> our

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
swivel attack if we had upgraded our

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.590 
swivel attack if we had upgraded our
ramp<00:02:41.580> who<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.120> used<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
ramp who could have used it to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
ramp who could have used it to
effectively<00:02:43.200> do<00:02:43.350> damage<00:02:43.739> against<00:02:44.070> him<00:02:44.190> but

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
effectively do damage against him but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.520 
effectively do damage against him but
we'll<00:02:45.300> finish<00:02:45.480> them<00:02:45.690> off<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:45.989> mortar<00:02:46.320> shot

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
we'll finish them off with a mortar shot

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.680 
we'll finish them off with a mortar shot
this<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.340> harder<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.269> have<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.510> lead

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
this is harder to do as we have to lead

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.720 
this is harder to do as we have to lead
the<00:02:48.840> shot<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.560> super<00:02:50.040> effective<00:02:50.370> when<00:02:50.610> it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the shot but super effective when it

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.710 
the shot but super effective when it
lands

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.260 

now<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.380> brig<00:02:54.740> is<00:02:54.890> incapacitated<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.820> we<00:02:56.030> can

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.960 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can
board<00:02:56.600> him<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.960> we<00:02:57.230> choose<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.550> since<00:02:58.790> we

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
board him if we choose to but since we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.670 
board him if we choose to but since we
still<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> tower<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.750> deal<00:02:59.900> with<00:03:00.140> we'll

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
still have a tower to deal with we'll

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.230 
still have a tower to deal with we'll
take<00:03:00.830> them<00:03:01.010> down<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.460> go<00:03:01.610> finish<00:03:01.910> off<00:03:02.060> this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
take them down and go finish off this

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.809 
take them down and go finish off this
boy

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.420 

even<00:03:08.599> though<00:03:08.719> we<00:03:09.079> can<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.349> fort<00:03:09.620> these<00:03:10.010> towers

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
even though we can the fort these towers

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.309 
even though we can the fort these towers
still<00:03:10.700> do<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.909> lot<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.239> damage<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.049> we<00:03:12.139> still

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
still do a lot of damage so we still

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:27.110 
still do a lot of damage so we still
have<00:03:12.379> to<00:03:12.620> brace<00:03:12.859> to<00:03:13.040> defend<00:03:13.340> ourselves

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.640 

now<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.480> towers<00:03:28.659> are<00:03:28.959> down<00:03:28.989> we<00:03:29.440> need<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
now that the towers are down we need to

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.710 
now that the towers are down we need to
infiltrate<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.400> capture<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.849> sport<00:03:31.180> to

the four Commandments seamlessly we go

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.949
