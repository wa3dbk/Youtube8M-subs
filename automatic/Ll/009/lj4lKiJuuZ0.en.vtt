00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hi my friends, I hope you enjoy the 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.320
 videos that I was putting in this video 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.059
 It is specifically for beginners and 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.339
 now these types of exercises also 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.959
 those who do 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.400
 they are usually going to do a sport that 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.670
 they do not want to lose much energy 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.310
 so but the beginners 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.170
 beginners people that we have a lot 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.480
 weight which we can not move 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.030
 a lot we can start doing these 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.039
 exercises now remember that with the 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.949
 simple fact of lifting a leg is 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.920
 energy which burns calories where 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.960
 if you are that you are overweight and you want 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.670
 burn calories without having to run 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 a lot because you can not or because you can not 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 you can feed yourself or the place there are many 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.149
 things that sometimes can not 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.620
 what can these exercises do 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.379
 let's start with the first one now 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.539
 how to warm up the whole body to 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.179
 beginners we will start first to 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.370
 the head and then at the feet observe 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.310
 well and you do it first is the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.019
 head sideways 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.009
 left and right well 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.009
 and then to the front 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.170
 then rod rotate on the head be it the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.170
 left or right in this way 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.810
 now everything that you are doing 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 you can do it ten times on each side or 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.470
 fifteen times 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 because now the shoulders are going down 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.170
 further down the shoulders facing 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.040
 towards the front then back 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.880
 behind and there you are burning calories in 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.079
 front then a full hand 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.079
 then forwards 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 again remember 10 times or 15 times 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.150
 the other back to forward 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 and then the two together 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.280
 and that 1520 then back 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.570
 ok now if you can not do it to the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.150
 speed that I'm doing it what 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.040
 you can do softly you do not need 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.080
 little by little as to that claw no more 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.750
 of energy doing it quickly now 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.000
 the waist that is the most 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.970
 the best thing you can do to make 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 start already to flex the whole body 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.490
 have a much better flexibility 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.150
 also the waist normally 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.240
 the ladies, I recommend you 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.050
 when they raise their body so they take out their 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:37.880
 hips and put your belly in 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:43.370
 and then from there they fold in this way is 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.920
 one two three either for there the 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.440
 men can do it like that women 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.110
 are the ones that need to have a 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.540
 position like this but men can 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.350
 do it like this only paraditos right 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.230
 and it is here for here they can show 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.430
 how it moves as it looks when it doubles 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:07.660
 1 2 3 then over there 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.660
 1 2 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.739
 remember 10 times now let's do 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.019
 let's go down here the knees put 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.970
 your hands here like that if you can not get much 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.319
 At least you can do it like this and now 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.950
 it's like that 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.390
 one 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.390
 and we go down we go down 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.730
 remember 15 15 times for for the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.319
 left to the right then now 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.260
 we go with the feet down one foot 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.060
 first they make little eyes on the floor alone 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.250
 remember not to roll 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.069
 on the floor there in the house but they do 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.980
 things 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.530
 to the right of the left the same and 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.629
 then they face back comes another 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.800
 better times now with the heel and 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.620
 then they flex it like this in this way 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.860
 ok the other the same again does the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.860
 milestones 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.660
 backwards and to the right because with the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.360
 heel 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.280
 they are not moving the camera and then with 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.950
 push-ups to the front 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.620
 now they put both feet together and they do it like that 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.750
 that way, try to get up like that 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 and you can do it again if 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.109
 you already do not feel sweating you're not 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.090
 warming up still feels you do not feel 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.010
 ready they can do it again 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.030
 I'm going to review once without having to 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.030
 say nothing remember 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.160
 [Applause] 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.809
 [Applause] 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.940
 [Applause] 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.220
 [Applause] 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.650
 now when you finished that already 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.680
 you feel ready now because of this 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.680
 way 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.720
 and you're ready to box to run 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.580
 or are your exercises if it's like 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.379
 beginners you can do this routine 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.650
