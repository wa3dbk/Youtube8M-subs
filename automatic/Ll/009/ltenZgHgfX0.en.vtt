that<00:02:01.439> her<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.740> head<00:02:01.950> was<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that her whole head was in it but it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
that her whole head was in it but it
wasn't<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.719> makes<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> picture

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
wasn't but that's what makes the picture

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.800 
wasn't but that's what makes the picture
cool<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.009> definitely
