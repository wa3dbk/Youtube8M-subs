00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 hi guys are still who's 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.059
 scorpion today a focus let's say a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.910
 small focus on the battery a little 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 updating 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.260
 guys I don't know what to say about the drums 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.369
 There is something strange about this 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 battery 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 I advise you not to buy this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 terminal because probably 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 radioactive in the battery on 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.990
 plutonium hello guys it's absurd I am the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 3 days for use and to read 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.280
 three days 36 percent of batteries 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 still three days of my use 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 intense use normal start anyway 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.309
 many web calls many web messages 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.660
 we also say the words I made a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.969
 I made a mistake these days with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 this battery is there after three days are 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.559
 still 36 percent that is I don't think 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.610
 that there is an android terminal with 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 this autonomy 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 that is, I don't know how to hurry with him 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.140
 ie screen let me know if it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.960
 you know but i really battery 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 let's look at one day let's see if I can 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.869
 focus as soon as you decide 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:28.549
 you focus yourself wait for it puts a 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.549
 fire manually because if not, here it is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.510
 then a day 10 hours a minute and 4 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 seconds with the battery 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:45.090
 so three games and I turn it off 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:51.570
 night of which three hours and 42 minutes and 39 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 seconds of screen every time I do 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.860
 but what am I the phone anyway 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.090
 wifi one day 9 hours 46 minutes of 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.330
 wifi almost always with wifi 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.860
 47 minute voice calls maybe not 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 updated since you do it a lot more 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.600
 we see face no 7 with the tv of 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.030
 browser calls log in access to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 bluetooth always on, etc. 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.209
 etc 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.280
 so guys there is the one who doesn't want it 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.020
 buy because he is not convinced ie me 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 I don't want to advertise high at 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.220
 tablet that honestly does not interest me 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.840
 but there is a terminal with a battery of 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 I kind of expected it from I don't know how much 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 there really is a phenomenal battery myself 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.050
 for example I have had many top of the range 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.900
 but what I like best 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.670
 it is not a top of the range SLR sang 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.959
 sensation xl mini and the name htc that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 break down I was a day and a half 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.489
 with the nose here we are at three days 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.620
 still they are at 36 percent ie they pass 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.530
 even per day it reaches four days 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.959
 five guys from this is all sorry 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.930
 the forced plutonium but we wanted it 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.790
 because the battery is really absurd 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.790
 hello to all the cookies
