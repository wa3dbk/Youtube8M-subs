00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
you can see if someone's going to try to

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.849 
you can see if someone's going to try to
attack<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:40.879> or<00:00:40.910> secret<00:00:41.600> attacked<00:00:41.929> you<00:00:42.170> or

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
anything like that now the reason why I

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.410 
anything like that now the reason why I
put<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.649> or<00:00:45.920> factory<00:00:46.519> right<00:00:46.820> up<00:00:46.969> there<00:00:47.179> in<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
put the or factory right up there in the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.889 
put the or factory right up there in the
top<00:00:47.629> right<00:00:47.929> is<00:00:48.140> because<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.070> can<00:00:49.249> see<00:00:49.659> as<00:00:50.659> I

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
top right is because you can see as I

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.860 
top right is because you can see as I
pan<00:00:51.199> back<00:00:51.469> up<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:51.980> back<00:00:52.159> that<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.269> or<00:00:53.480> truck

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
pan back up and back that the or truck

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.180 
pan back up and back that the or truck
is<00:00:54.760> gathering<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.030> gems<00:00:56.359> left<00:00:56.809> to<00:00:57.019> right<00:00:57.190> so

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
is gathering the gems left to right so

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.099 
is gathering the gems left to right so
that's<00:00:58.399> really<00:00:58.730> important<00:00:59.390> because<00:00:59.539> if<00:00:59.929> you

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
that's really important because if you

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.860 
that's really important because if you
put<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.710> any<00:01:01.519> further<00:01:01.789> down<00:01:02.179> he's<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.809> to

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
put it any further down he's going to

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.750 
put it any further down he's going to
travel<00:01:03.109> way<00:01:03.440> further<00:01:03.769> for<00:01:04.040> those<00:01:04.190> gems<00:01:04.489> and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
travel way further for those gems and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.370 
travel way further for those gems and
he's<00:01:04.940> even<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.330> little<00:01:05.479> further<00:01:05.780> away<00:01:06.020> right

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
he's even a little further away right

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.950 
he's even a little further away right
here<00:01:06.590> than<00:01:06.770> I'd<00:01:06.890> like<00:01:06.920> him<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.340> be<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.840> it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
works you really want the war factory

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.380 
works you really want the war factory

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
right on top there alright so now I got

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.140 
right on top there alright so now I got
my<00:01:14.540> war<00:01:14.810> factory<00:01:15.350> out<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.430> what<00:01:16.550> I'm<00:01:16.670> gonna<00:01:16.850> do

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
my war factory out and what I'm gonna do

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.720 
my war factory out and what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:17.540> build<00:01:18.320> tanks<00:01:18.620> at<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.890> same<00:01:19.190> time<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.640> I

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
is build tanks at the same time that I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.780 
is build tanks at the same time that I
build<00:01:19.940> more<00:01:20.180> men<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:22.190> reason<00:01:22.520> why<00:01:22.640> I'm

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
build more men and the reason why I'm

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.240 
build more men and the reason why I'm
doing<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.180> is<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.110> can<00:01:24.290> maximize<00:01:24.950> my

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
doing that is so that can maximize my

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.010 
doing that is so that can maximize my
infantry<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.710> my<00:01:27.710> tanks<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.870> get

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
infantry and my tanks so that I can get

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.230 
infantry and my tanks so that I can get
more<00:01:30.230> men<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.710> more<00:01:30.770> tanks<00:01:31.730> before<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.120> other

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
more men and more tanks before the other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.800 
more men and more tanks before the other
person<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.840> just<00:01:33.560> sold<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.100> barracks<00:01:34.810> right

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
person I just sold the barracks right

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.840 
person I just sold the barracks right
before<00:01:36.140> my<00:01:36.260> second<00:01:36.710> war<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.190> that<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.370> didn't

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
before my second war so that I didn't

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.700 
before my second war so that I didn't
run<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.180> power<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.960> can<00:01:39.080> see<00:01:39.290> my<00:01:39.440> power

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
run out of power you can see my power

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
run out of power you can see my power
gauge<00:01:40.010> is<00:01:40.220> still<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.700> green<00:01:41.410> which<00:01:42.410> is

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
gauge is still in the green which is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.730 
gauge is still in the green which is
really<00:01:43.730> you<00:01:44.660> know<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:45.050> important<00:01:45.560> because

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
really you know it's important because

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.820 
really you know it's important because
it<00:01:46.040> affects<00:01:46.160> how<00:01:46.580> fast<00:01:46.640> your<00:01:47.270> tanks<00:01:47.630> build<00:01:47.900> all

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
it affects how fast your tanks build all

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.920 
it affects how fast your tanks build all
right<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.370> what<00:01:49.850> I'm<00:01:49.940> doing<00:01:50.210> here<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.420> blocking

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
right so what I'm doing here is blocking

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.900 
right so what I'm doing here is blocking
off<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.200> whole<00:01:51.410> so<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.160> if<00:01:52.400> they<00:01:52.640> try<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
off the whole so that if they try to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
seconds flat alright so I'm up to my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.820 
seconds flat alright so I'm up to my
third<00:02:02.360> war<00:02:02.690> now<00:02:03.080> I'm<00:02:03.140> gonna<00:02:03.290> build<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.530> large

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
third war now I'm gonna build a large

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.640 
third war now I'm gonna build a large
advanced<00:02:04.280> power<00:02:04.930> so<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.020> get<00:02:06.260> my<00:02:06.350> power

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
advanced power so I can get my power

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.870 
advanced power so I can get my power
back<00:02:06.710> up<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.280> some<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.550> you<00:02:07.670> might<00:02:07.820> be

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
back up and some of you might be

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.850 
back up and some of you might be
thinking<00:02:08.030> well<00:02:08.539> why<00:02:08.720> did<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.080> let<00:02:09.470> your<00:02:09.619> power

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
thinking well why did you let your power

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.399 
thinking well why did you let your power
drain<00:02:10.429> if<00:02:10.700> tanks<00:02:11.390> build<00:02:11.599> faster<00:02:12.140> when<00:02:12.319> you

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
drain if tanks build faster when you

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.459 
drain if tanks build faster when you
have<00:02:12.530> power<00:02:12.829> well<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.640> reason<00:02:13.999> is<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.329> because

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
have power well the reason is is because

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.320 
have power well the reason is is because
you<00:02:15.469> get<00:02:15.620> more<00:02:15.829> tanks<00:02:16.159> out<00:02:16.340> quicker<00:02:16.640> because

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
you get more tanks out quicker because

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
you get more tanks out quicker because
when<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.510> get<00:02:17.660> three<00:02:17.930> wars<00:02:18.200> up<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.010> actually

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
when you get three wars up it actually

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.180 
when you get three wars up it actually
is<00:02:19.580> an<00:02:19.700> advantage<00:02:20.180> compared<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.960> doing<00:02:21.500> two

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
is an advantage compared to doing two

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.920 
is an advantage compared to doing two
small<00:02:22.520> Wars<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.030> beginning<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.600> actually

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
small Wars in the beginning you actually

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.320 
small Wars in the beginning you actually
get<00:02:24.050> more<00:02:24.080> tanks<00:02:24.530> out<00:02:24.650> quicker<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.330> now

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
get more tanks out quicker this way now

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.490 
get more tanks out quicker this way now
this<00:02:26.600> build<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:28.340> rushing<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.780> build<00:02:30.200> is
