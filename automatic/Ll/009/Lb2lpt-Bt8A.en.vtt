00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.650 

now<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.959> see<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.519> head<00:02:24.730> pitch<00:02:25.209> top<00:02:25.510> of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
now you see the head pitch top of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.789 
now you see the head pitch top of
Ferrari<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.860> car<00:02:27.100> going<00:02:27.280> going<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.269> floor

Ferrari the car going going on the floor
was<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.830> very<00:02:30.069> slow<00:02:30.190> world

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.069 

a<00:02:38.159> lot<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.700> spinning<00:02:39.180> wheel<00:02:39.299> now<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> can

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
a lot of spinning wheel now as you can

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.089 
a lot of spinning wheel now as you can
see<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.650> walking<00:02:40.920> from<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> tires<00:02:41.969> that

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
see that is walking from the tires that

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.490 
see that is walking from the tires that
is<00:02:44.099> only<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.579> half<00:02:44.609> of<00:02:44.969> his<00:02:45.000> nose<00:02:45.500> destroyed

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
is only the half of his nose destroyed

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.369 
is only the half of his nose destroyed
they're<00:02:46.799> driving<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.459> three<00:02:47.700> wheels<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
they're driving on three wheels and the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.860 
they're driving on three wheels and the
same<00:02:49.620> time<00:02:49.890> Johansson<00:02:50.849> just<00:02:51.150> after<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.659> pitch

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
same time Johansson just after the pitch

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.110 
same time Johansson just after the pitch
thought<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.469> off<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.859> track<00:02:53.129> with<00:02:53.400> but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
thought was off the track with but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.589 
thought was off the track with but
progress<00:02:54.840> making<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> shortcut<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
progress making a shortcut and that this

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.729 
progress making a shortcut and that this
time<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.290> was<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.340> behind<00:02:59.810> massive<00:03:00.810> exiting

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
time I was just behind massive exiting

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.369 
time I was just behind massive exiting
the<00:03:01.829> pitch<00:03:02.069> I<00:03:02.310> had<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.640> slower<00:03:03.139> pitstop<00:03:04.139> than

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
the pitch I had a slower pitstop than

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.800 
the pitch I had a slower pitstop than
him<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.250> was<00:03:05.430> important<00:03:05.939> to<00:03:06.030> take<00:03:06.239> him<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.629> soon

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
him so was important to take him as soon

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.959 
him so was important to take him as soon
as<00:03:06.870> possible<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.439> you<00:03:07.469> can<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.250> out

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
as possible as you can see that just out

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.899 
as possible as you can see that just out
of<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.299> feets<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.750> tried<00:03:10.079> by<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.069> outside<00:03:11.549> over

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
of the feets I tried by the outside over

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.690 
of the feets I tried by the outside over
the<00:03:12.060> wet<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:13.470> his<00:03:13.590> lake<00:03:13.769> tires<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.430> was

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the wet with his lake tires and that was

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.289 
the wet with his lake tires and that was
really<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.389> chance<00:03:16.079> that's<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.439> decided<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.889> take

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
really a chance that's I decided to take

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.479 
really a chance that's I decided to take
because<00:03:18.299> with<00:03:18.689> the<00:03:18.780> Honda<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.620> much<00:03:19.829> powerful

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
because with the Honda so much powerful

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.759 
because with the Honda so much powerful
on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.419> race<00:03:21.569> conditions<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.409> would<00:03:22.620> be

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
on the race conditions it would be

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.050 
on the race conditions it would be
difficult<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.189> take<00:03:23.370> him<00:03:23.579> on<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.730> straight

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
difficult to take him on the straight

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.589 
difficult to take him on the straight
eventually<00:03:24.629> I<00:03:25.549> found<00:03:26.549> myself<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.239> more<00:03:27.450> in

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
eventually I found myself that more in

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.550 
eventually I found myself that more in
third<00:03:27.870> place<00:03:28.109> behind<00:03:28.590> Goodson<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
third place behind Goodson and and the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.009 
third place behind Goodson and and the
Angeles<00:03:32.239> but<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.419> well<00:03:33.569> lab<00:03:34.760> we<00:03:35.760> got<00:03:36.030> back<00:03:36.810> into

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
Angeles but in well lab we got back into

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.899 
Angeles but in well lab we got back into
second<00:03:37.409> place<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.919> master<00:03:38.400> coming<00:03:38.639> from

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
second place with master coming from

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.659

behind<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:39.389> well<00:03:39.540> quite<00:03:39.840> strong<00:03:40.669> because

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
behind as well quite strong because

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.229 
behind as well quite strong because
those<00:03:42.030> two<00:03:42.299> was<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.199> on<00:03:43.379> on<00:03:43.769> what<00:03:44.040> tires<00:03:44.280> like

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
those two was to on on what tires like

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.939 
those two was to on on what tires like
you<00:03:45.419> see<00:03:45.599> there<00:03:45.780> are<00:03:45.840> LED<00:03:46.260> energies<00:03:46.590> here<00:03:46.889> on

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
you see there are LED energies here on

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.300 
you see there are LED energies here on
wet<00:03:47.159> tires<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.959> going<00:03:49.169> up<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.500> here<00:03:49.739> on<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:49.949> big

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
wet tires so going up to here on the big

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.820 
wet tires so going up to here on the big
straight<00:03:50.639> line

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
straight line

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.110

I<00:03:52.120> managed<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.150> take<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.720> teammates<00:03:54.820> over<00:03:55.820> the

I managed to take my teammates over the
wet<00:03:56.300> beat<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.050> track<00:03:57.320> there<00:03:57.770> was<00:03:57.890> a<00:03:57.920> dry

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
wet beat of the track there was a dry

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.670 
wet beat of the track there was a dry

line where Annie was but at the end of
the<00:04:00.800> straight<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.040> could<00:04:01.310> come<00:04:01.520> back<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.910> the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
the straight I could come back on the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.610 
the straight I could come back on the
dry<00:04:02.210> line<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.200> once<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:05.110> did<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.230> same<00:04:06.410> thing

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
dry line and once you did the same thing

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.970 
dry line and once you did the same thing
to<00:04:06.800> him<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.340> cup<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:07.790> corners<00:04:08.150> later<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.830> the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
to him a cup of corners later so the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.680 
to him a cup of corners later so the
pressure<00:04:10.250> was<00:04:10.580> at<00:04:10.940> that<00:04:11.090> moment

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
pressure was at that moment

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.010 
pressure was at that moment
strong<00:04:12.080> from<00:04:12.320> man<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:12.880> we<00:04:13.880> both<00:04:14.090> had<00:04:14.390> our<00:04:14.690> pit

strong from man so we both had our pit

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.900 
strong from man so we both had our pit
stop<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:15.800> didn't<00:04:16.040> have<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.280> stop<00:04:16.489> for<00:04:16.670> tires

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
stop so we didn't have to stop for tires

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.539
