00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.160
 Firming for our face is very 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.230
 common and very normal that for reasons of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.090
 to hang with what starts to fall 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 the cheeks the eyelids of the double chin 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.519
 finally everything starts hanging with the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 age and often the skin also 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 start hanging because we take 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910

 jude are the good videos that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.969

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 egg white a spoonful of cream 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.670
 basic moisturizer ok when I say that a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 Basic moisturizer you're not going to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.719
 use your moisturizer of those very 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 faces not something basic something that you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.660
 you find in pharmacies 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.060
 and half a spoonful of white sugar these 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.330
 are the ingredients and how is it made 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 simple in the container you're going to put the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.690
 egg white then you put the average 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 spoonful of white sugar and one 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.280
 About one tablespoon of your cream 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.230
 moisturizer that you have chosen and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 we mix very well nothing else there is 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.430
 be careful when you are mixing 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 that you are not going to happen because the clear 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.420
 of egg when it is mixed in addition it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 turns into foam and that we do not want 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.620
 we want you to want a consistency 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.290
 like from a gel a medium consistency 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.600
 slug ok ready since it's here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.450
 then we're not going to apply 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.240
 our face and neck completely 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.650
 clean you apply it for all your face 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.620
 all over your neck 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.320
 equal to let her act between 30 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.750
 45 minutes more or less that is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.510
 completely dry then remove them with 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 warm water and then if you follow 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.710
 apply your moisturizer this is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.759
 one of the few masks you can 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.979
 use either 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.739
 or at night since its ingredients 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.569
 they do not have something very acidic that can do 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.150
 reactions with the sun far 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.040
 This mask is perfect for everything 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 skin type if you have acne if you have 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.000
 oily skin if you have dry skin skin 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 sensible this comes perfect has 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.310
 many kindness look at the clear 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.900
 egg is a and is an instant lifting 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.150
 when you put an egg white for 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.150
 Yes alone in your face you will look at your skin 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.159
 more stretched brighter even the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.200
 visible pores are going to look like that 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.230
 they are more closed they are going to look very very 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.480
 very beautiful and good moisturizer 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.579
 because its name says it will hydrate us 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.459
 and the sugar is giving us a 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.409
 very gentle exfoliation on our face 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.049
 so it's a very complete mask 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.790
 with very good results I'll 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.159
 I recommend you do it between 2 to 3 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 times a week to have results 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.180
 optimal since if you are a person that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.220
 you do not have these problems that you're 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.470
 falling skin that looks like you 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.139
 plastic and all that because you can do it 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.060
 once a week, nothing more for 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.880
 keep it in good condition 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.250
