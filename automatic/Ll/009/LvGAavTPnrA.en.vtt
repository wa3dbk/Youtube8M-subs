00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
what's going on with this one it's got a
great<00:01:40.259> flavor<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.880> definitely

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
great flavor to it and we definitely

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
great flavor to it and we definitely
taste<00:01:42.450> everything<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.530> described

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
taste everything that I described

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
taste everything that I described
earlier<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
earlier in there it's a little on the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.160 
earlier in there it's a little on the
chewy<00:01:45.810> side

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
chewy side

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.859 
chewy side
I<00:01:46.430> think<00:01:47.430> yesterday's<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:48.149> stronger<00:01:48.570> because

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I think yesterday's was stronger because

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
I think yesterday's was stronger because
everything<00:01:49.350> mixed<00:01:49.649> together<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.100> well<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
everything mixed together so well you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
everything mixed together so well you
couldn't<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.759> pinpoint<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.229> over

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
couldn't really pinpoint one thing over

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.330 
couldn't really pinpoint one thing over
something<00:01:53.250> else<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.659> steak

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
something else but with this the steak

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.499 
something else but with this the steak
is<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.759> tasty<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.369> definitely<00:01:59.909> tell

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
is good tasty but you definitely tell

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.030 
is good tasty but you definitely tell
that<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.259> opposed<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.860> everything

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that it's there as opposed to everything

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
that it's there as opposed to everything
else<00:02:02.280> everything<00:02:02.909> isn't<00:02:03.090> working<00:02:03.509> together

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
else everything isn't working together

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.190 
else everything isn't working together
in<00:02:03.960> unison<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.159> good<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.240> feel<00:02:07.049> as

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
in unison so it's good but I feel as

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.499 
in unison so it's good but I feel as
though<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:08.009> tired<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.580> after

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
though I would get tired of this after

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170 
though I would get tired of this after
probably<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.489> about<00:02:11.670> half<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
probably I don't know about half of it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.210 
probably I don't know about half of it
or<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.720> think

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
or so I think

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.560 
or so I think
Shaw<00:02:13.400> would<00:02:13.550> start<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:13.910> hurt<00:02:14.060> from<00:02:14.180> chewing<00:02:14.480> on

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
Shaw would start to hurt from chewing on

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.370 
Shaw would start to hurt from chewing on
the<00:02:14.660> steak<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.140> solid<00:02:15.710> solid<00:02:16.100> above-average

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
the steak a solid solid above-average

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.560 
the steak a solid solid above-average
burrito<00:02:18.380> I'd<00:02:19.370> give<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> low<00:02:19.910> floor

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
burrito I'd give it a low floor

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.050 
burrito I'd give it a low floor
I<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:21.650> I'm<00:02:21.920> kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.220> surprised<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> like

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I just I'm kind of surprised that I like

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.460 
I just I'm kind of surprised that I like
the<00:02:23.240> one<00:02:23.390> yesterday<00:02:23.570> more<00:02:23.990> than<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.320> this

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
the one yesterday more than I like this

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.920 
the one yesterday more than I like this
one<00:02:24.620> today<00:02:24.770> but<00:02:25.100> overall<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.480> idea

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
one today but overall I think the idea

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.920 
one today but overall I think the idea
of<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.380> epic<00:02:27.650> burritos<00:02:28.100> was<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.120> really<00:02:29.660> really

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
of the epic burritos was a really really

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.020 
of the epic burritos was a really really
good<00:02:30.290> thing<00:02:30.560> for<00:02:30.770> del<00:02:31.160> Taco<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.730> mean<00:02:31.880> they're

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
good thing for del Taco I mean they're

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.270 
good thing for del Taco I mean they're
they're<00:02:32.600> pushing<00:02:32.990> something<00:02:33.350> out<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.980> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
they're pushing something out to that I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.890 
they're pushing something out to that I
don't<00:02:34.760> think<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:34.970> would<00:02:35.090> normally<00:02:35.360> try<00:02:35.780> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
don't think they would normally try and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.280 
don't think they would normally try and
do<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.530> does<00:02:36.940> scream<00:02:37.940> higher<00:02:38.690> than<00:02:39.110> del

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
do this this does scream higher than del

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.830 
do this this does scream higher than del
tacos<00:02:39.740> usual<00:02:40.310> quality<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:41.390> push<00:02:41.630> out
