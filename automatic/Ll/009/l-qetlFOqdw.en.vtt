00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.900
 the real life of arras kids but 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.400
 me my swing south 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:19.600
 it rains I am under an umbrella min 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.520
 I am with hugo talented man and 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.040
 we are in front of the active bmw turn 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.510
 his jacket an important car because 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.690
 that symbolizes a lot of things 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 it symbolizes the hyper segmenting its 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.019
 blunders for hyper segmentation lo 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.120
 it symbolizes the hyper segmentation of the 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:49.149
 of the market because bmw now who 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.309
 comes on the minivan market with 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.819
 traction is good the front wheels 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.969
 which drives the car the best and not 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:01.210
 the rear propulsion is for 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.989
 soon up I passed as if a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.619
 blonde go to young and brunettes what 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.299
 ccc then there is immediately there are two 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.490
 speech in front of that there is the speech of 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.090
 to say but yes you have to produce you have to 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.920
 to sell 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.040
 well it is doing well must be 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.530
 on every segment where are we going and 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.820
 I'm sure I can come back 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.380
 and then after a speech a little bit more 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.750
 far than say in the long run and if 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.369
 finally we do not lose we are hungry said 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 not a little bit his mark finally being 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.049
 wanting to be on all terrain in 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:38.080
 being finally leaving no more 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:40.390
 unoccupied place and my first reaction 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.770
 it is to say to you anyway 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.970
 drove his car on the ip on the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.740
 small roads it's still 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.649
 really good record that is to say that 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 even if one or two guys like that in 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.990
 first division 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.460
 it preserves they preserve their their 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.670
 famous road feel and actually because 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.319
 that if it's still the same universe 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.170
 varied but here we find this 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:21.370
 chassis chassis sport story 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:25.989
 small crisis comfort is well done 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.209
 verizon they are annoying at the back 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.930
 a lot of room you have them each 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:36.790
 armchair sabotage the bench does not pull 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.070
 little gained on the chest well damn them 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.570
 little isofix there for baby seats 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.240
 who are related not go to them 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.280
 search by blow 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.430
 yandle are you running squarely in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:58.980
 a plane what gold means but it's 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:03:00.880
 not me I take ingo the cei 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.430
 jeanne to laugh all the time 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.820
 meeting because she actually has one 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.530
 in an active tourer bmw a minivan 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.690
 a minivan ride exception me on me 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.690
 thought unbelievable good god with them these 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.440
 words of the lacc good but it's raining 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.730
 some ropes 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.840
 we are in the south of France a 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.020
 fifties is strictly no 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.190
 idea but but but I would not 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.450
 doubt a little miss to what you said 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.550
 a lot of things we talked about them has 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.230
 so 26 years you work at 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.470
 intersections who is worried the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.530
 magazine and style website in 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.550
 movement otherwise it's beautiful yeah no 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 but I have a car so beautiful in 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.450
 more but no but it's interesting 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.080
 because you said something to them 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.380
 sense did not pay attention memory of 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.450
 fox and that I want to put it to a 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.300
 moment it's you who drove I did not 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.640
 still drove and said no it's fine 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.410
 and everything is at ten anyway it's a 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.240
 bm 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.010
 implied it's top why when we 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.140
 a 26 years ago while you like them 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.920
 cars but you start in the tests 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.840
 does not have a car 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.020
 it's good to say that that is to say that 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.640
 bm already has a credit top sums 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.960
 obviously why like all people 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.050
 all German brands 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.310
 I tell you the game briefly ben I already 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.020
 26 years old but I like beautiful things 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.130
 yeah so I know that beautiful things 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.270
 it's also the same things that cost 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.970
 expensive and therefore mercedes audi bmc 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.720
 classic what fast of lassitude hard 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.840
 in my group of friends 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.260
 Well that's it's mini it's audi a3 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.010
 it's his classes to his products his 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.930
 prisons or they want to have it's this 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.880
 they did what I'm good at hanging around 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.590
 maybe with friends who are a little 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.620
 easy not that I chose it is 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.870
 like that but mewes and cars on 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.770
 which they are heading chioula and 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.060
 then and then oms 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.860
 we still felt 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.060
 the plastic association you have on 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.250
 some cars that are not of the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.960
 same origin have to say and there we see 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.180
 all the beautiful finish and comfort 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.030
 nothing we said the amount there 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.060
 cornering anything you see the following 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.940
 this content 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.940
 really technical details but 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.540
 be a thing I love at he said 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.840
 it is that it is the the touch of the 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.700
 grain of escaping violence were 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.260
 ok, we get the impression we want 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:32.350
 outright that one caresses most of the 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.700
 cow so well thought leather you 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.440
 pleased what it is all i think 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.790
 since 26-year-old waka site lunches 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.670
 that you feel the same thing 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.670
 ck lycées very studied what 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.830
 so now if we asked ourselves 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.140
 what is this little beautiful weather 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.240
 because it breaks when therein lies 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:58.230
 what is it that will cause 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.460
 collision warning we are there 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.470
 warnings and interventions of the brake 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.720
 in the event of a collision, it is this 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.310
 it was said that if I do not brake 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.580
 that the autonomous car she braked to 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.200
 my place that all the sick 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.080
 begins to have after his assets I 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.160
 do not know how funny it is 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.900
 as a button because we would rather 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.460
 thought something closing doors or I 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.730
 do not know what 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.730
 There you go 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.069
 in fact you fall well but this opinion but 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.039
 it's your life you stay behind the wheel you have 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.659
 very elegant 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.120
 bonjour Valerie greenhouses at the gate 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:41.710
 do that you're protected from the wind but 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.789
 certainly not metal engine valérie I 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.770
 introduce you briefly 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.300
 it's still extraordinary you are 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.759
 journalist and you work for a 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.259
 newspaper that only deals with bmw 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.210
 exactly it's huge 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:56.590
 that is to say if I have a person 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.360
 questioned this morning it is you that is 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.539
 who drove this car a long time ago 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.389
 I have just one question is it is 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.469
 you lose the wheel tassler hold his 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.629
 woman and the serious girl who have you 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.300
 this is how did you feel that 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:12.460
 it was a pull frankly not I 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.539
 think that's the blue side do of 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.560
 this car I think actually 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:19.180
 if we get in without knowing we are 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.110
 in a pull and not a 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.250
 propulsion as is the case 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.770
 usually on the mark 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.419
 I think frankly we're going 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.969
 account very late the agreement that must 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.189
 drive against bmw ask what is it 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:32.080
 was without AIDS touching bmc road 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:34.060
 always a bit silly to say that but 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.949
 it is true that they have a very easter of 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.669
 the structure is there you have to drive them 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:41.020
 you find yourself touching the road 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.759
 frankly yes especially for a segment 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.039
 like that where we do not expect it says 

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:46.779
 we're going to be in a super family 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:50.560
 convenient to use but without a real 

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:52.089
 felt very very clean to some 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.919
 something we can already know about 

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:55.449
 a sports car and finally it's 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.370
 still well there so for you they 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:59.529
 do not go their soul to the heck of a 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.580
 unlike appearances all the 

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:02.199
 time that we are outside the 

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.610
 car we can believe that yes but a 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.900
 time we have inside not at all 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.060
 yes because in terms of style it's 

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.509
 more than that for the coup by cons we have 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.830
 beautiful return in every sense that 

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:14.400
 still a little flat is a 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.400
 little more and more
