00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.490
 good kids, we keep on broadcasting 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.800
 from yogurt and good today 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.150
 be the teacher's day I have a 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.340
 manuality so that they take a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.550
 gift to his teacher next what 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.100
 we are going to need is cardboard any 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.949
 kind of those boxes that there is no longer 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.019
 make or maybe it can be cereal but 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.360
 we're going to good he said the roll 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.250
 how are we going to cut a ribbon 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.600
 of those who put their moms as 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.040
 waist monks a few pieces of cloth like 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.039
 the one that I have here that I already put it as 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.600
 if it was hippie or silicone in the gun 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.430
 of silicone and scissors and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.170
 especially that they are on edge 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.020
 rounded so they are not going to cut 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.500
 and well let's tell them how it's done 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.970
 all this for more practice to see the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.970
 united look helps you 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.460
 have to do is cut from a 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.320
 house where it comes in the part of the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.420
 flap portion bottom can be marc 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.890
 equal to every time you want and 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 of the measure that you want 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.900
 is going to be our bag now what 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 Next thing we're going to do is choose 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.610
 the painting that you want in this case 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.310
 I chose rosita and orange because I'm going to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.760
 make a mix here I already have it 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.500
 pintadito look first I put a layer 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.170
 orange and so you do not see a whole 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.020
 old lady and nothing else with a sponge is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.150
 I started the color rosita and it's like 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.400
 see the double effect that does not know what 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.220
 color is and know how that made it a 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.320
 expert the next thing you have to 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.810
 to do is with the pieces that the tie 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.430
 mom has like to clear obvious that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.880
 do not take dirty because it will be based 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.640
 teacher you're going to cut those of the measure of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 the height of your bag in this case what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.500
 what I did was measure it and here you go 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.110
 shorten 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.800
 of the same width for example my bag and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.260
 this is going to be my width then with this 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
 Reta cited as well and as you see is already more or 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.670
 less than the width now the next thing that 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.070
 we have to do is with the two pieces 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.230
 that we already have, we are going to put one on top 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.290
 the other way 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.209
 and adjusting it exactly the measure that 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 we're going to want it to be like a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.200
 form of sun to pita and for equal here 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.410
 down we're going to paste it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.879
 to see little kids and paste everything and now 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.879
 the next thing I had 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.569
 it turns out that nothing else here 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.930
 I stuck next now you can see by 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.900
 I stuck it in here and here 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.760
 here and at the end we stayed like that it opens and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.330
 it closes opens and closes and as you see it is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.330
 it is death 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.350
 this not ready as the one that takes away the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.330
 one hour from the head we go nothing else 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.530
 to place the measure on you 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.920
 and we stopped it and we stayed 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.050
 I like it 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.900
 I really give you 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.900
 okay, let's go to good cut
