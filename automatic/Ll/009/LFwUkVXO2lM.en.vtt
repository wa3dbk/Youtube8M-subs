00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.420
 It is introduction of how to make rose using paper napkin 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.570
 I often go to a coffee shop , and a paper napkin 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.630
 The time of the square is a little this time I'd also Toka those of rectangle paper napkin 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.429
 Please prepare 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:30.400
 It is not possible to use a rectangular shape, but the petals are slightly thin and so beautiful 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:36.160
 In not it this time I would like to make in the things of the square 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.320
 At first I have it spread and I will roll it This is rolled from here and I don't care about Meso Dream 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.010
 In the way you like 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 I will roll 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.600
 It is the thickness of the while I will in a cylindrical shape Nee 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.289
 With a thickness of about 2 fingers 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.289
 Wind up 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.890
 In the same direction as the winding direction 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 Twist 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.740
 It's about a long time I can not go to the second joint of the finger joint 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.950
 That curl becomes on the other side and say the take you in and what can I wound in the same direction this in Well 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 If you 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.810
 Because it returns to the original, it is all in the same direction as the winding direction after all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.810
 I will make it before 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.180
 The root of this flower is firmly 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 Let's be careful here because you can clean it well 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.340
 I 'm going to make sweet stalks Some more flowers at this point too 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.720
 Approximately one 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.430
 And it has sown about this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 I will put out the next leaf 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.250
 I will expand the part below 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.250
 This part was spread 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.939
 To cover 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.939
 As wrapping 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.830
 hold 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.740
 If so, it is still summarized 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 I can do it already. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.390
 At this point in time I will put out too many leaves 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.069
 I will like to tulip That's this Borough Kedomo I'm good at it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.069
 Let's summarize in a little compact 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.690
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.580
 Let's make petals 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.710
 Do you see it in this? 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.710
 Here you have here 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.040

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 The opposition vernier impinge 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.470
 I thought this a little I'd say be left a little while ago 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.920
 To show the cup bloom 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.160
 More and I'll served as a form go from the crumpling 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.530
 It will be rosey 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.400
