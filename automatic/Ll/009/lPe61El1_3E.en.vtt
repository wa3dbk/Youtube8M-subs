00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:02.528
&lt;i&gt;I have seen&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;your nobler&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;aspirations&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:04.530
&lt;i&gt;Fall off&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;one by one&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:04.597 --> 00:00:06.565
&lt;i&gt;Till the&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;master passion--&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:08.033
&lt;i&gt;Greed--&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.568
&lt;i&gt;Engrosses you.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:12.137
&lt;i&gt;Farewell,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ebenezer.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:16.074
May you be happy
with the path you have chosen.

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:18.577
I am happy
with the path

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:20.446
That I've chosen,
you bitch!

00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:22.213
I couldn't be happier!

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.049
What are you?
Crazy?

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.452
Yeah, buddy,
I'm crazy!

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.587
Crazy like a fox!

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:31.590
Crazy enough to see through
your little tricks.

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:33.992
I'm back.
I can see now.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.496
No one could have been
that simple and good

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.532
And kind and decent,
yet caring, wonderful.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.534
Not on this planet,

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:45.504
Not unless they had
something to hide,

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:47.506
Some trick
up their sleeve.

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.541
You wouldn't trick me!

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.544
Don't try to trick me
because I'm back!

00:00:52.612 --> 00:00:55.347
We'll check things out
at operation reach out.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:56.915
Step aside, grandma.

00:00:56.983 --> 00:00:58.550
Good-bye.

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:00.552
&lt;i&gt;Blood drive.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;$20 a pint.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.053
&lt;i&gt;Come on, folks.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.524
&lt;i&gt;Ah, here's a happy donor.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:08.560
&lt;i&gt;Merry christmas.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:10.395
Ah!

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.564
Well, just
for the record,

00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:14.065
&lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; left me.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:18.069
You had to go somewhere
and get your head together!

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:21.573
Baby, my head is just fine.
Check it out!

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.075
It's right here
where it belongs!

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:26.144
What's the point?

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.079
It's lonely at the top?

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:30.549
It's not lonely
at the top!

00:01:30.617 --> 00:01:33.519
Oh, maybe around my birthday
and at sunset.

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:36.021
There have been
a couple weekends

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:39.491
That would have raised hell
with a normal person.

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:42.528
But that's me.
I'm a widow of business.

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.030
It's my life!
I've chosen it!

00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:49.034
At least I work someplace
that you can find

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:51.003
When you're
looking for it.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.038
Ok, here we are now.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:56.909
When I want a wife,
I'm going to buy one,

00:01:56.976 --> 00:02:00.045
And she's going to be
devoted to me,

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.548
To my wants,
and my needs,

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.049
Not like you!

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:07.019
Let's face it--
you treated me like dirt!

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:10.055
Oh, lord! Another wild
and wooly one.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.024
Honey, you look frozen.

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:13.525
Come over here
