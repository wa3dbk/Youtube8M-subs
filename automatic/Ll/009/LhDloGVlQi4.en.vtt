just put the whole building around into
megan<00:01:41.580> inside<00:01:41.910> one<00:01:42.120> so<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.050> that's<00:01:43.200> that's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
megan inside one so so that's that's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
megan inside one so so that's that's
pretty<00:01:43.500> cool<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:45.260> number<00:01:46.260> two<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
pretty cool and number two this is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
pretty cool and number two this is
probably<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> could<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.869> any<00:01:49.020> any

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
probably one that could be for any any

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.760 
probably one that could be for any any
of<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.880> everywhere<00:01:51.210> but

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
of them is they're everywhere but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.320 
of them is they're everywhere but
apparently<00:01:52.770> Hollywood<00:01:53.430> studios<00:01:53.760> is<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.090> best

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
apparently Hollywood studios is the best

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.880 
apparently Hollywood studios is the best
place<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:54.780> hidden<00:01:55.200> mickeys<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:57.890> don't

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.840 
place to find hidden mickeys and I don't
know<00:01:58.979> maybe<00:01:59.190> that's<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
know maybe that's just because the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
know maybe that's just because the
sorcerer<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:02.570> there's<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.020> sound

actually doesn't have anything inside of
it<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.250> underneath<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.790> it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it and I think just underneath of it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.160 
it and I think just underneath of it
because<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.180> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.360> elevated<00:03:15.780> has<00:03:16.020> two

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
because it's kind of elevated has two

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.199 
because it's kind of elevated has two
shops<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.680> stuff<00:03:16.770> underneath<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.340> but

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
shops and stuff underneath of it but

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.870 
shops and stuff underneath of it but
yeah<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.900> I<00:03:19.190> wonder<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.400> they<00:03:20.550> they<00:03:20.760> would

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
yeah so I wonder what they they would

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.370 
yeah so I wonder what they they would
have<00:03:21.030> put<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.300> there<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.780> they<00:03:22.140> would<00:03:22.290> have

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
have put in there if they would have

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.360 
have put in there if they would have
been<00:03:22.500> something<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.010> would<00:03:23.340> be

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
been something like that that would be

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.810 
been something like that that would be
kind<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> cool<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.790> know<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> secret
