00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
though that had focused the heat a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.160 
though that had focused the heat a
little<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:49.820> but<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.780> know<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.049> just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
little more but you know it's just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
little more but you know it's just
something<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.590> about<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.220> something

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
something to think about and something

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.759 
something to think about and something
that<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.000> could<00:02:54.180> adapt<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.500> could

that you could adapt you know you could

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.340 
that you could adapt you know you could
probably<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.340> smaller<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.110> tuna<00:02:58.110> cans

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
probably do this smaller with tuna cans

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.430 
probably do this smaller with tuna cans
or<00:02:58.709> soup<00:02:58.950> cans<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.239> know<00:03:00.390> number<00:03:00.959> two<00:03:01.140> cans

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
or soup cans or you know number two cans

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920 
or soup cans or you know number two cans
