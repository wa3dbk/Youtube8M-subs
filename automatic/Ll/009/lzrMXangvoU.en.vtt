00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.609
 hi girls today i 'm going 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.959
 to talk to you about something 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.950
 particular is then a lot of 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.320
 people told me why the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.759
 sonic cable car we know you can 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.880
 have big cheaper than 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.180
 seed or that of chelsea tomorrow 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:28.630
 Thursday the market 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:28.630
 then as we want to see and where this one 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:38.830
 live a small swinging motion 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.830
 we 're going to say are the very ones right here 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:50.980
 you would necessarily want to 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.030
 put this on the skin of your face 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.289
 so I was it's still eh 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.489
 I said to myself I'm a little masos 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.890
 on the edges I told myself good that does not 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.090
 tries nothing has nothing or rather that does not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.809
 tries nothing can not do good 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.759
 reviews and I tested his face with 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 of course the brush in 6 to 6 the brush 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:11.330
 for normal that I use attention 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.000
 hang on my body and even on 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 the father squeezes thoroughly so that can 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.110
 to be not bad to go to embody him 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 we know it's relatively strong 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.009
 while this one is really done 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 for the face so I have the brush for 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.830
 sensitive skin I think I am 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.090
 shoot later in the skin very 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.860
 sensitive because for now I 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.979
 am a little bit in a period of 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.140
 test i will really use it thoroughly 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.780
 in the first week has already I 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.179
 see that iliad and you all over 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.619
 more present it is normally normal 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.450
 start so I'll keep you informed 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.950
 thereafter but want to make you a 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 little idea and quick to make a 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.149
 comparison between the two do not think 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.610
 that a rotating brush can match 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.569
 a big sony since it's not 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.009
 all the same technique 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.709
 the features are totally 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.599
 different and there is a patent filed 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.800
 by same for clarisse and so do not think 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.250
 not that you will be able to find other 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.590
 something else 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.080
 all this to tell you beware of this 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.390
 kind of products of course that can 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.150
 to be like on some 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.980
 ah but bros sony it has nothing to do 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.450
 with a big who turns okay what 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.330
 kind of rotating brush this one and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.209
 sonic others are with a system of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.740
 vibration a little point on the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.090
 characteristics of the brushes to start 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.890
 by the cnam and sony who arranges the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.480
 sonic technology and so who has 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.050
 microphone movements also associate there with 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.610
 vibration 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.560
 we then have rotary brushes 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.540
 who simply have 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.830
 increases and finally in the same 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.660
 price range that please and we 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.520
 tale at the philips killer visa which is 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.330
 this also the rotational food system 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.950
 or on your choice 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.630
 what do you prefer personally 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.280
 from afar try something from this 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.010
 kind of there that are less likely to 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.420
 to attack my skin anyway than that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.000
 one I really enjoy listening to the sound 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.250
 so much the noise is scary all that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.170
 to tell you sonic technology 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.550
 it's technology sony technology 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.650
 revolving it is the technology torments 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.850
 which has nothing to do with it is like 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.430
 rotating toothbrushes and brass 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.560
 band sonic justified price difference 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.530
 so filed by a patent do not think 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.489
 that you will find by elia aymon there in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.590
 Anyway I hope this little 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.269
 comparison will have pleased you since it is 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.860
 a very quick comparison I do some 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.860
 big kisses and two beings and high schools
