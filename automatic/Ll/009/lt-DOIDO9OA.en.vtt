 good high quality magic 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.229
 see only I am the reason this video is for 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.500
 guide how much perfect perfect use 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.539
 handling of booking some people at 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.940
 times in sometimes comes into contact 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.460
 us on the support saying that your 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.460
 printer is failing ink is not 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.369
 leaving certain color is not able 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.100
 succeed and what if you like 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.460
 we want first to say a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.189
 thing the whole printer is made to 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.860
 work with the manufacturer's paint 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.750
 when you put in another ink or 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.630
 ink that is not of the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.259
 manufacturer one ink dye one ink 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.229
 pigmentation is obvious and expected 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.290
 that this printer at first in your 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.950
 adaptation phase will present some 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.619
 failures 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.420
 This is normal, and you speak our then. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.390
 I moved to a system that will bring me 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.490
 continuous faults depends on the way 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.079
 you will see this failure depends 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.930
 of this brand the way you are going 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.939
 to see this initial difficulty 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.770
 people who have a little more 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.470
 patience to people who have a 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.739
 little more time or even that it has 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.720
 someone around who can help 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.739
 she will calculate the following 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.600
 how much does it cost to use you? 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.140
 spend and spend money 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.300
 with cartridge replacement with purchase of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.120
 cartridge refill inks for those who 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.200
 reload cartridges and then you will do 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.170
 the parameter 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 with buc inc we do not promise a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.120
 infallible system an infallible magic 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 an infallible formula 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.290
 there is no such thing in the area of ​​informatics 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.240
 equipment at one time or another will 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.420
 have an irregularity 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.910
 You have to be prepared for this alone. 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.340
 that while working with buck inc 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.940
 You will learn some procedures. 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.160
 important for the operation of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.480
 continuity in the proper functioning of its 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.640
 product 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.310
 what are the procedures can not 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.350
 they all speak here in this moment 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.170
 booking which has several procedures 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.960
 they are not bureaucratic things are not 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.470
 difficult things are everyday things 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.290
 are often repeated 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.020
 problem of oge go from here to 30 days one 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.240
 difficulty because the ink that is 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.030
 designed to work on that head 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.190
 was not the one you already 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.260
 noticed when you put a cartridge 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.230
 the printer to the printer. 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.900
 It works perfectly because because 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.790
 engineering of that paint was totally 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.410
 designed and geared towards working with 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.450
 that print head 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.030
 so this is normal when you put 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.610
 another ink as I said before it goes 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.130
 present some kind of difficulty and 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.080
 this is an adaptation as the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.140
 print head has been absorbing this 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.900
 texture of paints the viscosity it goes 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.450
 making your work 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.550
 uniform is regular and do not go 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.640
 present so often 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.130
 but those initial difficulties ok 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.830
 so this is a very important point 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.850
 that you should consider working with 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.220
 the khimki 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.330
 so you go as I said before 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.210
 on the tip of the pencil 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.760
 I'm having an economy of 95 per 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:23.300
 hundreds of paints and cartridges are worth 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.390
 It's for me to have this initial difficulty. 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.150
 what could happen may happen 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.090
 some printers and we do not know 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.960
 explain why they already adapt immediately 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.419
 to the equipment 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.440
 and it looks like our initial installation is 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.600
 always the same 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.850
 the original cartridge first. 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.280
 then place the khimki 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.259
 then it is a standard procedure that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.030
 this should always be our way. 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.270
 The team is trained and prepared to 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.289
 always do even then if you received 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.590
 in your house 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.699
 the equipment and the first impression 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.370
 he presented some flaw in some 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.340
 simply color you make a clean 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.919
 the printhead through the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.650
 program that is the program 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.539
 that you have installed through the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.389
 original installation of the product that you 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.009
 I got it at your house there in your company. 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.250
 at your address 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.180
 ok then this is the installation cd that 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.070
 you received 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.090
 Are you going to install the program there? 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.180
 have the options 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.520
 You can not approach this video here anymore. 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.280
 you can obviously request us this 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.740
 procedure that is very simple 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.250
 in the printer program you go 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.979
 locate the maintenance and cleaning of the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.970
 head cleaning heads or some 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.310
 something worth 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.550
 Ok guys, this video is more for 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.330
 to really guide this operation of the 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.449
 equipment 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.900
 I repeat we do not promise a magic formula
