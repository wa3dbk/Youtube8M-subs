questions<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.580> ago<00:00:29.760> about

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
questions I like a little bit ago about

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510 
questions I like a little bit ago about
how<00:00:30.990> i<00:00:31.140> made<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> redstone<00:00:31.769> clock<00:00:32.040> after<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
how i made this redstone clock after I

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.090 
how i made this redstone clock after I
put<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.969> modern<00:00:33.420> view<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.950> just

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
put up that modern view so this is just

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530 
put up that modern view so this is just
like<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> slowest<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> gets<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> looks

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
like the slowest it gets like it looks

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.790 
like the slowest it gets like it looks
like<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.930> stupid<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:37.500> you're<00:00:37.770> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like so stupid right now you're just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
like so stupid right now you're just
like<00:00:38.989> okay<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> stupid<00:00:41.430> but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
like okay this is this is stupid but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
like okay this is this is stupid but
when<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> put<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> really<00:00:43.230> fast<00:00:43.559> mmm<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> goes

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
when you put it really fast mmm it goes

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
when you put it really fast mmm it goes
pretty<00:00:44.910> pro<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> second<00:00:46.890> speed

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
pretty pro like this is the second speed

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
pretty pro like this is the second speed
I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.059> put<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.719> there's<00:00:48.870> like

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I mean you can put I think there's like

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.380 
I mean you can put I think there's like
nine<00:00:49.170> speeds<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.910> mainly<00:00:51.239> use

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
nine speeds actually but I mainly use

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
nine speeds actually but I mainly use
three<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
three and then like this one is the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
three and then like this one is the
really<00:00:53.160> fast<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.899> think<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
really fast one I think this is the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.840 
really fast one I think this is the
fastest<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.129> without<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.610> breaking

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
fastest you can get without it breaking

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
fastest you can get without it breaking
and<00:00:57.289> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.710> showing<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and this is just me showing it off on a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.889 
and this is just me showing it off on a
target<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.879> we're<00:01:00.239> gonna<00:01:00.359> switch<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
target but we're gonna switch to the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
target but we're gonna switch to the
video<00:01:01.170> right<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.520> stop

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
video right now look at how they stop

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.630 
video right now look at how they stop
when<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:02.910> hit<00:01:03.030> me<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.290> weird<00:01:04.640> but

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
when they hit me that's pretty weird but

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
when they hit me that's pretty weird but
here<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> side<00:01:06.360> make<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:07.080> gonna

here we go this side make you're gonna

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.830 
here we go this side make you're gonna
need<00:01:07.260> three<00:01:07.710> dispensers<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:09.090> redstone<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
need three dispensers some redstone and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.490 
need three dispensers some redstone and
one<00:01:10.290> redstone<00:01:10.500> torch<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.189> really<00:01:11.880> simple<00:01:12.500> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.750 
one redstone torch that really simple so
you're<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> place<00:01:14.460> three

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you're just going to want to place three

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
you're just going to want to place three
in<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> row<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:16.799> I'm

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
three in a row there it's like mainly
threes<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:22.950> down<00:01:23.100> another<00:01:23.250> three

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
threes then you put down another three

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.429 
threes then you put down another three
dispensers<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.170> three<00:01:25.409> more

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
dispensers and put up three more

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
dispensers and put up three more
redstone<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
redstone right there now this is the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.280 
redstone right there now this is the
tricky<00:01:27.600> part<00:01:29.030> when<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.450> redstone

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
tricky part when you put your redstone

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
tricky part when you put your redstone
torch<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.850> dispenser<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.299> even

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
torch down on your dispenser on even

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
torch down on your dispenser on even
though<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.130> fix<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
though I put it that way but I fix it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
though I put it that way but I fix it
later<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.240> put<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.479> redstone<00:01:36.840> torch

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
later when you put your redstone torch

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.740 
later when you put your redstone torch
down<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> gotta<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.040> quick<00:01:38.369> or

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
down you gotta do it really quick or

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.850 
down you gotta do it really quick or
otherwise<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.020> whole<00:01:40.049> thing<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.619> like

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
otherwise the whole thing will just like

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.170 
otherwise the whole thing will just like
break<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:44.180> it's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
break so you see like right here it's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
break so you see like right here it's
not<00:01:45.390> working<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.110> forgot<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> put<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
not working because I forgot to put it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.899 
not working because I forgot to put it
down<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.399> break<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> piece<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
down so you got to like break a piece of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.180 
down so you got to like break a piece of
the<00:01:48.030> redstone<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.450> put<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> bed

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
the redstone and put the bed

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.450 
the redstone and put the bed
so<00:01:49.880> put<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:51.980> that<00:01:52.100> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
so put it like that just like that and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.430 
so put it like that just like that and
that's<00:01:52.730> working<00:01:53.120> but<00:01:53.300> it's<00:01:53.540> too<00:01:53.810> fast<00:01:54.110> it

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
that's working but it's too fast it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.950 
that's working but it's too fast it
catches<00:01:54.800> up<00:01:54.890> with<00:01:54.950> itself<00:01:55.600> see<00:01:56.600> how<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> broke

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
catches up with itself see how I broke

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.890 
catches up with itself see how I broke
it<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:58.670> too<00:01:58.850> fast<00:01:59.060> because<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.540> too<00:01:59.690> tiny

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
it it's too fast because it's too tiny

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.810 
it it's too fast because it's too tiny
if<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.650> made<00:02:00.800> like<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.010> longer<00:02:01.400> clock<00:02:01.610> with

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
if you made like a longer clock with

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.700 
if you made like a longer clock with
like<00:02:01.940> four<00:02:02.180> dispensers<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.810> plus<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.590> can

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
like four dispensers and plus you can

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.960 
like four dispensers and plus you can
just<00:02:03.890> keep<00:02:04.010> doing<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.520> whole<00:02:04.550> time<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
just keep doing this the whole time you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.040 
just keep doing this the whole time you
can<00:02:05.090> make<00:02:05.210> like<00:02:05.330> five<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.690> these<00:02:05.750> clocks

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
can make like five of these clocks

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.080 
can make like five of these clocks
attached<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.680> each<00:02:06.800> other<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.550> do<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:07.910> crazy

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
attached to each other and do some crazy

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270 
attached to each other and do some crazy
stuff<00:02:08.300> but<00:02:09.200> say<00:02:09.350> there's<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.860> slowest

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
stuff but say there's like the slowest

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.680 
stuff but say there's like the slowest
right<00:02:10.460> there<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> here<00:02:11.240> I'm<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> fix

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
right there and here I'm going to fix

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.000 
right there and here I'm going to fix
the<00:02:11.780> dispenser<00:02:12.230> right<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.560> put<00:02:12.680> some<00:02:12.770> arrows

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the dispenser right and put some arrows

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.950 
the dispenser right and put some arrows
in<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.490> see<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:14.630> pretty

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
in it so you can see but that's pretty

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.500 
in it so you can see but that's pretty
