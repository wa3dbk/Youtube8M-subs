00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.319 
increases the range of the s12 making it
an<00:03:09.139> all<00:03:09.290> around<00:03:09.530> better<00:03:09.859> weapon<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.060> laser

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
an all around better weapon the laser

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.080 
an all around better weapon the laser
sight<00:03:11.629> gives<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.139> tight<00:03:12.409> hip<00:03:12.709> fire<00:03:13.010> spread

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
sight gives you a tight hip fire spread

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.909 
sight gives you a tight hip fire spread
this<00:03:14.090> reduces<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.720> accuracy<00:03:15.290> loss<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.650> fire

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
this reduces the accuracy loss of fire

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.589 
this reduces the accuracy loss of fire
from<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.220> hip<00:03:16.340> compared<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.120> aiming<00:03:17.419> down<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
from the hip compared to aiming down the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.390 
from the hip compared to aiming down the
sights<00:03:17.720> without<00:03:18.440> having<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.889> give<00:03:19.040> up<00:03:19.129> any

a<00:03:22.220> good<00:03:22.459> idea<00:03:22.729> to<00:03:22.940> aim<00:03:23.060> down<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.299> sights<00:03:23.419> at
