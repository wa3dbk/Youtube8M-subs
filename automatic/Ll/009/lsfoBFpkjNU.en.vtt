00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 at 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.160
 get to know you with technical 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.240
 capabilities of the garrett metal detector 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.160
 ace euro 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.119
 and I will begin by turning your 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.440
 attention to almost absolute 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.879
 identity of the appearance of this 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.339
 metal detector with metal detector 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.280
 previous series with a metal detector 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:43.070
 garrett ace 250 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.809
 many search engines beginners are those who only 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.350
 facing the choice of their first 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.010
 search appliance they doubt whether 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.229
 that the garrett ace euro metal detector 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.680
 something significantly different 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:01.460
 his previous brother well except 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.729
 maybe coil however i want 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.710
 say that the difference is these stupid 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.939
 constructive preserved completely he 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.080
 very comfortable and not worth changing 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.009
 technology of material 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.920
 worked out 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.660
 I completely agree that the metal detector 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.590
 repeated the appearance of his 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.420
 previous search collection but 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 the stuffing of this metal from the casino on 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 completely different in the first place here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 faster process in the second and most 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.510
 main metal detector got a new 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.909
 operating frequency 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.780
 now frequency 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.979
 garrett ace euro metal detector 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.210
 make up 8.25 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.700
 kilohertz while the previous one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 models, it was 7.2 kilohertz 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.900
 What is it done for? 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.630
 in order to give a metal detector 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.440
 garrett ace euro more versatility 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.270
 more opportunities to search for some 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.340
 small goals that agree 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.679
 their Russian search is very useful 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.110
 because often we say those 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.930
 same small medieval silver money 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.080
 so here these metal detector will be 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.430
 look for them much preferable 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.430
 signal processor like me 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.920
 also said completely new he is more 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.860
 fast smart and accordingly you 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.170
 get a response from the target faster than 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.599
 to the previous model for urgent functions 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.579
 In principle, the mink has not changed and led 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.260
 appeared mode 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.819
 for faith 0 discrimination mode as well 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.860
 the scale has changed 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:56.459
 depths if on model 250 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.829
 she was in inches then constructors here 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.630
 meet each other 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.200
 European search engines accustomed to others 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.530
 units of measure and modernized it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.060
 making a scale in centimeters it is very 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.650
 convenient everything else is basically left 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.400
 since it was 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.239
 but those parameters that have changed and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.120
 which we have already identified they do 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.569
 this device is slightly different more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.950
 high level and so what else is there 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:35.250
 there is a garrett ace 250 metal detector 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.220
 metal detector that works in two 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.720
 dynamic and static modes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.299
 dynamic mode is mode 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 the main search in which you are active 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.090
 move coil above ground 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.299
 static search mode allows you to 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.290
 find the center of the goal that you already 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.430
 discovered it is very necessary if you 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.040
 want to extract 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.750
 aim without damaging his spade process 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.069
 digging therefore it is very useful and 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.430
 Naturally we are still moving 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.439
 me zest this metal detector 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.849
 which is definitely his new 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.859
 coil new coil size 28 by 22 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.549
 centimeter 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:25.750
 made by technology w 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.960
 this coil is great looking for any 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.520
 non-ferrous metals but however and if black 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:37.150
 they are interested in you and very interesting 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.090
 as this coil is the first coil which 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.229
 does not require additional protection in 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.840
 set of delivery 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:49.300
 protection for this coil is not but if desired 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:52.289
 You can purchase it from non-dealers. 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.440
 less the manufacturer itself claims that 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:59.400
 both the coil body and the filler 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.530
 coil special compound 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.160
 make it so wear resistant 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.800
 blow that extra ass 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.979
 additional acquisition costs 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.490
 protection for this coil is not required you 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:19.229
 can use just by buying in 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.300
 store and you can immediately go to search 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.039
 the coil is completely water protected that is 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.470
 you can work for rain and snow 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.909
 can on debt 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.520
 explore some small ponds puddle 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:36.490
 roadside grooves can enter boldly 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.620
 search on the beach where you can train 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.759
 How on 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.180
 freshwater beach freshwater 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.979
 shallow water and on the coast 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.389
 please have any problems here 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.460
 will not occur 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.289
 the only restriction is impossible 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.320
 expose to moisture block 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.550
 control it is not tight in the case 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.139
 if you drop a metal detector over there 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.030
 in fact there is a one hundred percent guarantee 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:06.300
 the fact that it will fail be 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:12.759
 neat with this still stop 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:15.260
 a little bit on the sound indication of this 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:19.460
 metal detector it is very similar to 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.610
 the previous series that is here is available 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.190
 separation of the response key but it 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.060
 very convenient in the search process that is 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.250
 You are initially acquiring a finder and 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.250
 going out for the first time their field will be 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.090
 Of course, use and visual 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.880
 indication reading information from the scale 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.430
 discrimination and special running 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.430
 markers which shows in which 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.500
 the discharge is the goal you found but 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.720
 in the aftermath 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.090
 gaining some experience with this 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.980
 metal detectors you will be less and less 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.190
 pay less attention to the display all 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.740
 use sound response more 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.560
 this is u detectors i can say that he 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.800
 very comfortable and you will not have 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.350
 no problem identifying that target 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.390
 which you find well and advise 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.520
 it is natural to use headphones 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.400
 which come bundled for this 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.470
 metal detector for raising 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.560
 your search engine performance 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.370
 labor well and in the next part we are with you 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.640
 consider in more detail the functionality 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.320
 garrett ace euro metal detector 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:34.610
 look at the control panel 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.430
 keys and I can assure you right away that 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.740
 it is there to search or very simple nothing 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.630
 complicated it is not enough to read 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.860
 once instruction to understand 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.470
 principles of its work 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.140
 but still hours to walk around the field that you them 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.560
 fix and put in my head all very 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.560
 simply
