00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
know a faggot doesn't necessarily mean

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.750 
know a faggot doesn't necessarily mean
gay<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.810> means<00:02:08.900> like<00:02:09.140> oh<00:02:09.380> you're<00:02:09.800> just

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760

stupid I don't know but I'm you think it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600 
stupid I don't know but I'm you think it
was<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.170> reasons<00:02:15.500> why<00:02:15.650> hi<00:02:15.830> well<00:02:16.460> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
was one of the reasons why hi well that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.400 
was one of the reasons why hi well that
was<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:16.820> last<00:02:16.970> strike<00:02:17.300> anyway<00:02:17.660> or<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.260> was<00:02:18.350> just

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
was my last strike anyway or it was just

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
was my last strike anyway or it was just
due<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.160> misleading<00:02:19.850> descriptions<00:02:20.060> but

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
due to the misleading descriptions but

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.890 
due to the misleading descriptions but
either<00:02:21.500> way<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.100> think<00:02:22.360> starting<00:02:23.360> over<00:02:23.510> will<00:02:23.750> be

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
either way I think starting over will be

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.560 
either way I think starting over will be
a<00:02:23.930> good<00:02:24.230> decision<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.010> if<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> guys<00:02:26.240> support
