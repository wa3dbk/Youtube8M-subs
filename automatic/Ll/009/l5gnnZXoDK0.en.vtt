to your turns in short turns it's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
to your turns in short turns it's
important<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.690> upper<00:00:33.899> body<00:00:34.079> stays

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
important that the upper body stays

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.700 
important that the upper body stays
facing<00:00:34.950> down<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> hill<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.960> legs<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.440> skis

facing down the hill the legs and skis

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
facing down the hill the legs and skis
will<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.070> working<00:00:38.640> underneath<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> body<00:00:39.719> or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
will be working underneath the body or

will be working underneath the body or
the<00:00:40.530> torso<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.219> remaining<00:00:41.550> still<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.540> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the torso is remaining still what we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
the torso is remaining still what we
need<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.020> develop<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> separation<00:00:44.700> between

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
need to develop is a separation between

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.709 
need to develop is a separation between
the<00:00:45.450> upper<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:45.960> lower<00:00:46.020> body<00:00:50.360> watch<00:00:51.360> map<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the upper and lower body watch map a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.930 
the upper and lower body watch map a
body<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.620> facing<00:00:52.980> down<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> hill<00:00:53.730> on

my legs and feet are turning underneath

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
my legs and feet are turning underneath
a<00:01:01.579> great<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> visualize<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> separation

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
a great way to visualize this separation

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
a great way to visualize this separation
is<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> imagine<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.400> poles<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
is to imagine you have two poles and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
is to imagine you have two poles and
they're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> rest<00:01:06.780> underneath<00:01:07.680> your

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
they're going to rest underneath your

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.210 
they're going to rest underneath your
arms<00:01:08.360> similar<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.840> gymnastics<00:01:10.080> parallel<00:01:10.950> bars

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
arms similar to gymnastics parallel bars

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390 
arms similar to gymnastics parallel bars
now<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> upper<00:01:12.420> body<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> slide<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
now the upper body is going to slide and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.999 
now the upper body is going to slide and
stay<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.200> down<00:01:16.470> those<00:01:16.680> poles

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
stay still all the way down those poles

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.310 
stay still all the way down those poles
why<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> legs<00:01:18.150> work<00:01:18.479> underneath<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> body

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
why the legs work underneath the body

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.539 
why the legs work underneath the body
let<00:01:20.130> me<00:01:20.250> show<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.729> talking<00:01:21.060> about

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.859 

imagine<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.969> poles<00:01:29.270> are<00:01:29.539> running<00:01:29.750> down

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
imagine that the poles are running down

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.200 
imagine that the poles are running down
the<00:01:30.049> length<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.530> slope<00:01:30.829> my<00:01:31.759> body<00:01:32.000> will

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
the length of the slope my body will

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.240 
the length of the slope my body will
follow<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.719> line<00:01:32.960> staying<00:01:33.560> straight<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
follow that line staying straight and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:43.120 
follow that line staying straight and
level<00:01:34.640> from<00:01:35.119> top<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.659> bottom<00:01:41.829> I'm<00:01:42.829> going<00:01:43.070> to

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
level from top to bottom I'm going to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.529 
level from top to bottom I'm going to
use<00:01:43.310> these<00:01:43.460> rollers<00:01:43.909> down<00:01:44.060> here<00:01:44.329> to

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
use these rollers down here to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.749 
use these rollers down here to
exaggerate<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.350> movement<00:01:45.500> I'm<00:01:46.490> going<00:01:46.700> to

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
exaggerate the movement I'm going to

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.210 
exaggerate the movement I'm going to
retract<00:01:47.210> my<00:01:47.509> legs<00:01:47.840> as<00:01:48.079> my<00:01:48.259> feet<00:01:48.560> come<00:01:48.799> under<00:01:49.100> me

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
retract my legs as my feet come under me

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.639 
retract my legs as my feet come under me
and<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:49.909> extend<00:01:50.630> down<00:01:50.899> again<00:01:51.229> into<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
and then extend down again into the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:03.810 
and then extend down again into the
trough<00:01:52.210> retract<00:01:53.470> extend

this<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.540> a<00:02:04.570> great<00:02:04.840> way<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.050> fill<00:02:05.470> these

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
this is a great way to fill these

keeping the arms nicely in front it may

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.780 
keeping the arms nicely in front it may
be<00:02:43.450> one<00:02:43.720> less<00:02:43.930> thing<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> think<00:02:44.290> about

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
be one less thing to think about

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.950 
be one less thing to think about
removing<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.880> poles<00:02:46.150> will<00:02:46.510> allow<00:02:46.750> your<00:02:46.900> body

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960
