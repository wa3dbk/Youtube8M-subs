00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 and me and my strength I order 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 open the portal to their 1 reality where 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.900
 you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.480
 wherever I am here is weightlessness 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 obvious is the map of my neighborhoods 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.269
 so here I have to choose a place where 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.090
 nobody sees me i can't think in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.680
 limbo 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 Well, it seems to be better 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 there is only one attempt should not be 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.820
 right then maybe there is a place in my 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 fence z yep and what a good option i 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.570
 I leave the house allegedly to school then 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 parents go to work and I 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 come back and open the portal a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 if the parents linger I will use 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.480
 rope over the fence and again 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.480
 I will open the portal in my genius 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.580
 I seem to be getting used to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.580
 and now back 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.140
 that was so magical 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.870
 but in my opinion it was a little difficult and well 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 This, too, although judging by all this to 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.910
 difficulties we are not used to sense 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.120
 I mean opening portals to us 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.280
 no one saw her recognizing our grave 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.860
 parents so that they don't know about 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
 the existence of this school and that we 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.230
 magicians will also be right 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:24.030
 by the way my and where is your white bow oh-oh 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 something happened a well nothing 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.980
 let me have a special 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.250
 small problems but apparently can handle 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.290
 I own you sure about that development 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.060
 something bad in friendly help 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.770
 yes no i'm not saying that there is something 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.410
 bad in friendly help 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 I'm talking about my independence about 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.550
 that I don't want to litter your head with yours 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.410
 problems are good but then let's just 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.930
 agree that if by tomorrow 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.840
 your problems will not disappear you will tell 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.060
 they are well agreed upon by us 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.890
 pace we are here till the morning just im like 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.750
 about going home 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:08.330
 I don't mind me, too, bye girls and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.330
 programs elena see you see you 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.640
 general return home problems due 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.770
 my rash act though mine 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.850
 family as the opening problem such 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.400
 life path 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.370
 who were advancing to burn extract from 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:31.450
 but what i'm afraid well and come back there and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.300
 do not sell problems though if rubber is not 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.300
 I will go this way with even greater rise
