00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.450
 this new video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I want to show you how to share 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.429
 a folder between mac and windows 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.590
 what is this procedure for? 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 mainly to connect different 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.320
 computers that are connected to it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.630
 LAN network or the same wifi network without 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.340
 having to use a physical cable between the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 two is enough if not connected to the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 same network so we will have an icon 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 on both desktops we will have in this 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 folder and for me if it is to write 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 both for reading and also for trashing 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.920
 the elements on both sides 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.079
 but the folder will be physically located 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 on wind it's easier for you to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 share respect than on mac 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.350
 therefore the folder will be physically on 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.510
 pc with windows however we can access it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.360
 quietly from mac and change 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 all the various things clearly off line 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 that is, without a net from mac we will not be able to do 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.879
 nothing but from window we will be able anyway 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 access the files 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 let 's start the configuration and move on to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 windows 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.309
 ok fantastic here we are on windows la 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.650
 first thing we need to do to bring 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 to complete the sharing process e 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.610
 which daron ip static ours 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.350
 computer to make sure that at each 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 restarting the computer lepis is always 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.970
 that and that the mac and is able to find it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.470
 on the net so we would have first thing 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.570
 right click on the icon 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.049
 internet connection has changed and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.880
 Wifi 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 ie that you have the ethernet cable e 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.659
 press up to 300 network connections 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 and sharing 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.460
 at this point for destinations or on wifi or 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.930
 ethernet icon and go up 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.369
 property 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.009
 at this point, go down to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.509
 interesting protocol version 4 is here 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.250
 click on use the following 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.840
 ip address for I waited a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 fill it in now 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.520
 now we have the command prompt and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.950
 let's write ip with fig 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.990
 slash ball this we need to know 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.930
 what is the default gateway e 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 the current address you are 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.150
 using at this point write 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.399
 the address you find here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.030
 of the ip address to subnet mask and also 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.100
 gateway dns don't put those that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 I'm here if you want to go faster 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.190
 I recommend the google ones that are 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 88 88 84 4 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.810
 at this point after we have done 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.180
 this small copy we press on ok 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.880
 yes we go in this case and we close 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.040
 at this point our windows 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 to the assembly this local ip address 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.209
 for clearly unless you have 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.400
 fastweb the public one is dynamic and not 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.670
 nothing can be done to power though 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.890
 share this folder on ours 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.580
 mac and create an icon on the desktop 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.010
 what we have to do we have to go to 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.600
 top path of the what folder 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.850
 it means it means that if we create 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.340
 the share folder and we share 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.860
 only this then from our mac 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.510
 we will only be able to enter in sharing for 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.660
 which we will not be able to create an icon of 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.580
 this folder but we can create 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.959
 an icon of a possible folder to the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.000
 inside 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.160
 so how can we solve this 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.769
 case my folder on the desktop then 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.130
 I go suu kyi users 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.650
 my desktop name which is the folder 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.170
 which contains sharing I do key 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.459
 right property and just like on 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.380
 sharing 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.440
 I'm going to share it with sharing 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.120
 advanced share the folder 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.989
 Full control authorizations a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.989
 every one 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.310
 at this point we give ok and from our mac 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.470
 then we can connect to the desktop to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.739
 to then be able to create a connection of the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.650
 folder sharing at this point from 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.950
 our mac we go on go to connection 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.440
 to the server and we write smb your points 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.440
 double slash 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.330
 we insert lipik we have marked before 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.500
 when we made the configuration 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.290
 on wind 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.190
 the boutique and we press on connect 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.370
 since it is the first time there 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.060
 connect to you will ask you clearly 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.860
 to enter the username and password 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.840
 user who was using su 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.650
 windows to understand that you are not a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.750
 stranger 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.280
 after you have entered the username e 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.160
 password press ok and choose the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.110
 folder you want to share in 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.780
 In this case I go to select the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.040
 desktop because then the folder 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.520
 shared 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.020
 I want to go just to create an icon 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.610
 connection 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.590
 how do you see this my desktop that o 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.710
 on windows or the photoshop icon of 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.200
 utorrent is the share folder a 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.510
 this point I make right click creates 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.660
 alias in the same thing to do a 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.030
 connection on windows the connection 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.910
 I will be created clearly on windows 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.930
 then I drag and I put it on mine 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.250
 mac 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.770
 finally our icon of 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.510
 sharing was created and how 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.790
 see on both screens the 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.640
 folder is the same if I go to 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.430
 copy this file into this pdf 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.770
 folder automatically will also appear 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.900
 from here and if from wind to sail I go to 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.140
 delete in the trash can automatically 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.350
 it will also disappear from our mac and this one 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.630
 is our sharing done at 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.150
