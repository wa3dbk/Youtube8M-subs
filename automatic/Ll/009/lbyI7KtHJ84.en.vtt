00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.100
 and team names like they're super that 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.110
 are very, very good because I'm 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.000
 same and we are in a new mini 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.129
 very special tutorial since in this 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.650
 I will show you how to make a mini 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.260
 villagers farm very simple and as 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.029
 can see is very compact because it is 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.770
 good design is good unlike 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.410
 of other designs this is very compact and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.869
 the time it allows you to select the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.400
 villagers that you want in the case of 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.640
 that you, for example, have no more 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.610
 villagers up here just active 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.950
 there is this door so that they do not go up 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.989
 more villagers and you can and then go 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.170
 dying and not now when they do not 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.270
 simply serve the bushes and active 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.790
 this so that new villagers come up like 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.110
 can see here just upload this 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.969
 put on this platform you already 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.020
 You can take to the area where you 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.960
 want not now in this village generate 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.329
 a maximum of 25 villagers here in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.569
 then when, for example, they have 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.010
 25 they are going to go pushing they go to 

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:09.680
 achieve upload here 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.810
 more or less and then they will generate more 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.300
 down here and this one is going to go up 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.340
 can see it goes up it goes up and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.770
 because with a little work and is to be 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.390
 put on this platform now yes you already 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.790
 you do not want them to upload more 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.160
 simply activate this and then it's going to 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.410
 smother it then as I commented 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720
 It is a very simple design and design 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.260
 originals of this gentleman tango tec 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.700
 anyway I leave your channel and your 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.290
 original video in the description for 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.870
 that they go and see it is a video in 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.240
 English but but it's very good is the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.080
 person I think that he made this mechanism 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.910
 Well first then it 's very good 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.590
 very compact and the time it is convenient 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.800
 since as you can see, it is not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.340
 they require many many mechanisms neither 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.500
 many doors only six are required and 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.510
 because based on this the farm works 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 so then nothing, let's see how 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.229
 you do very well the first thing you have 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.710
 what to do is a base of 11 blocks per 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.060
 11 blocks worth with a height of four 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.130
 blocks worth you have to leave these 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.140
 four blocks without anything down 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.210
 so that it fits perfectly what 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.490
 we are going to occupy that it is the villager and the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.620
 doors then we're going to continue 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.600
 today that we are going to surround all this with a 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.490
 Two high wall is worth something more or 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.230
 less so very well that 's how you have to 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.670
 be two high for all 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.530
 sides very well what we are going to do 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 now it is to put in each corner a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.480
 water flow is worth something like that and now 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.310
 let's put two villagers in the center 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.930
 so that they reproduce now if you 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.940
 they start to fall this is a visual book 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.210
 nothing happens then what are we going to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.220
 to do is put a glass ceiling something 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 that's fine if in the corners and with nothing 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.060
 only so you are going to fill it 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.710
 all very well when your roof is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.810
 finished let's do this so that 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.450
 the villagers can go out let's put 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.370
 a block we are going to put a sign and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.710
 let's put a stream of water worth 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.660
 something like that now we 're going to go to the side 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.069
 opposite and we're going to do the same thing a 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.859
 block 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.049
 sign of these a sign and a block of 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.389
 water is very easy ok to continue 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.280
 we are going to raise a block like this 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.920
 way here is going to be where the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.680
 villagers pass worth then important 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.420
 ok we remove this we put this and here 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.269
 let's put a bucket of water worth 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.889
 something like that and the same thing on this side as 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.139
 can see here the currents collide 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.700
 then we are going to continue it goes for 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.769
 continue let's put three blocks of 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.389
 glass in this way and we're going to put 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.370
 three dairy something like that and so it's worth 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.989
 very simple and here we put one of water 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.239
 or that we got the rise for the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.459
 villagers then let's do something like that 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.129
 a kind of cross and we're going to put in 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.439
 the middle a solid block the door of 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.719
 fence and remove the block worth we put 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.189
 to one side a solid block and a lever 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.530
 It's worth this way you can activate 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.019
 perfectly and we keep going up vale 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.689
 in this way now here you can put 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.470
 for example three blocks of water worth 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.250
 three buckets something like that to see would be such 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.200
 such and here you could already put for example 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.120
 a sign is worth then nothing we are going to 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.160
 continue or that we got the rise to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.620
 the villagers then let's do something 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.290
 well a kind of cross and let's put 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.120
 in the middle a solid block the door 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.700
 of fence and remove the block is worth 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.260
 we put aside a solid block and a 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.210
 lever is worth this way you can 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.850
 activate perfectly and we continue 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.710
 going up voucher this way now here 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.610
 you can put for example three blocks 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.670
 of water is worth three buckets something like that to see 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.760
 would be such and here you could put 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.530
 for example a sign is worth then 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.330
 nothing, let's continue perfect 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.210
 we continue putting here a block of 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.650
 water plugging here and completing this 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.900
 it's worth it in this way for the villagers 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.240
 do not run away with glasses is not 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.850
 recommended because then they can 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.130
 see not when there are villagers something like that 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 so then we are going to continue to be worth 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.910
 let's put the doors and let's go down 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.250
 this way ok as you can see we remove 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.740
 these three blocks and we extend these 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.780
 three is worth this way now we're going 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.800
 for houses and we will put the six doors 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.229
 so 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.090
 and so it's perfect then we go to 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.060
 separate us two blocks and let's put 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.759
 here to the villager in this way we upload it 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.289
 this crystal and we put here the 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.210
 villager , I say, you can put it with 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.680
 what you want and you can cover it with 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.539
 the block that you want while it is 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.169
 solid now here is something very 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.000
 important 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.409
 ok sorry for the cut but as you 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.569
 commented you have to see that these 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.699
 three blocks are always exposed to 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.960
 the light of day is worth something like this you can 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.819
 put glass because it is a block 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.270
 transparent but if you put any 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.710
 another block either here here or more 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.099
 up the farm will not work 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.659
 so it is important that this be 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.680
 totally without any block except 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.810
 of the glass since it is a block 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.159
 transparent but you can also remove 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.680
 glass is to say that it is always 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.409
 taking daylight is worth then 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.569
 important very well and in this way already 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.310
 then the farm would be finished ten 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.229
 note that if you have here few 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.229
 villagers, it's going to take longer 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.629
 operate the mechanism now when a 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.159
 no longer achieve and here is going to go 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.800
 going up through these mechanisms 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:13.040
 here then you put the lever that was removed 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.110
 then you are going to climb they are going to go up 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.330
 Well, you have to have this open, 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.220
 so that the villagers do not drown 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.050
 then simply the allianz is not going to 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.300
 Get here, here you can do the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.160
 zone that you want you can remove 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.560
 these two blocks and you can go doing 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.090
 this is not so as to gather here 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.070
 your villagers, you can do it here 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.140
 the way you want and how they 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.520
 comment is a very simple farm already 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.620
 which as you can see is nothing 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.300
 complicated to do does not require network are 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.600
 does not require a lot of doors 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.580
 and it's very simple and very efficient in the 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.470
 farm then you know if you liked it 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.720
 this tutorial you can leave a comment 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.340
 can you tell me what you think you can 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.710
 give recommendations for more mini 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.450
 tutorials you can follow me on twitter 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.580
 you can like the page 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.470
 facebook and then nothing we see in the 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.040
 next tutorial so 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.040
 bye
