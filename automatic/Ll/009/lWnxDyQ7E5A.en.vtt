00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.070
 What we have to do is go ask them 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.949
 the support for farming six people 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.370

 say hey farming right away we have to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.460
 choose between these words there are two

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.420
 in case you get upset you have to 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.150
 negotiate with them by giving them an item 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.240

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.820
 blackbird you must have access to black 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.150
 birds or a friend that you buy them the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.440
 last option that is more expensive is to buy 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.440
 the items in the market 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.440

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.520
 case we have to give another item and choose 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.790
 another word like that until you give us the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.790
 support for 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.980

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.840
 to be checking the qwest they were going 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.170
