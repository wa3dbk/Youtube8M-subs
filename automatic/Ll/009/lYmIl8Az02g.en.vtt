00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
on course today and we're looking at a

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.760 
on course today and we're looking at a
shot<00:00:14.710> with<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.040> ball<00:00:15.280> above<00:00:15.730> my<00:00:16.030> feet<00:00:16.299> so<00:00:17.080> I've

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
shot with the ball above my feet so I've

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.290 
shot with the ball above my feet so I've
hit<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.070> ball<00:00:18.220> down<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.550> fairway<00:00:18.790> I've<00:00:19.180> got

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
hit the ball down the fairway I've got

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.910 
hit the ball down the fairway I've got
about<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.540> hundred<00:00:19.750> yards<00:00:19.930> into<00:00:20.350> the<00:00:20.650> green

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
about a hundred yards into the green

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.910 
about a hundred yards into the green
here<00:00:21.340> baal-zebub<00:00:22.180> my<00:00:22.720> feet<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.200> I<00:00:23.290> know<00:00:23.349> that

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
here baal-zebub my feet and I know that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.740 
here baal-zebub my feet and I know that
the<00:00:24.160> flight<00:00:24.490> in<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.910> air<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.240> going<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.510> follow

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
the flight in the air is going to follow

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.750 
the flight in the air is going to follow
the<00:00:25.990> same<00:00:26.320> as<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.740> contours<00:00:27.220> on<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.520> ground

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
the same as the contours on the ground

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.130 
the same as the contours on the ground
so<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.090> means<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.630> ball<00:00:28.810> is<00:00:28.840> going<00:00:28.960> to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
so that means that the ball is going to

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.600 
so that means that the ball is going to
tend<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.529> go<00:00:29.650> this<00:00:29.830> way<00:00:30.039> if<00:00:30.160> it<00:00:30.279> was<00:00:30.369> on<00:00:30.520> the

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
tend to go this way if it was on the

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.519 
tend to go this way if it was on the
ground<00:00:30.730> up<00:00:31.510> in<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.810> air<00:00:31.930> it's<00:00:32.080> going<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.290> tend

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
ground up in the air it's going to tend

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.260 
ground up in the air it's going to tend
to<00:00:32.650> fly<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.400> left<00:00:33.640> so<00:00:33.850> I've<00:00:33.910> got<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.150> be

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
to fly to the left so I've got to be

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.060 
to fly to the left so I've got to be
aware<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.720> that<00:00:34.930> when<00:00:35.110> I'm<00:00:35.410> hitting<00:00:35.650> this<00:00:35.770> shot

aware of that when I'm hitting this shot

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.100 
aware of that when I'm hitting this shot
the<00:00:36.910> other<00:00:37.090> thing<00:00:37.360> I've<00:00:37.480> got<00:00:37.629> to<00:00:37.720> be<00:00:37.809> aware<00:00:38.050> of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
the other thing I've got to be aware of

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.110 
the other thing I've got to be aware of
is<00:00:38.410> if<00:00:38.559> i<00:00:38.650> take<00:00:38.830> my<00:00:39.040> normal<00:00:39.489> address<00:00:39.850> position

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
is if i take my normal address position

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.600 
is if i take my normal address position
with<00:00:40.570> normal<00:00:40.930> shaft<00:00:41.170> length<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:42.489> the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
with normal shaft length because the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.130 
with normal shaft length because the
balls<00:00:42.820> above<00:00:43.149> my<00:00:43.300> feet<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.660> club's<00:00:43.899> going<00:00:44.079> to

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
balls above my feet the club's going to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.500 
balls above my feet the club's going to
tend<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.440> dig<00:00:44.649> into<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.950> turf<00:00:45.190> too<00:00:45.460> much<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:46.030> I

don't want that to happen I've got to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.740 
don't want that to happen I've got to
make<00:00:47.920> sure<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.430> get<00:00:48.489> solid<00:00:48.940> contact<00:00:49.510> on

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
going to choose a target which is a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.130 
going to choose a target which is a
little<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.579> right<00:00:54.700> of<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.090> flag<00:00:55.270> in

little to the right of the flag in

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.720 
little to the right of the flag in
anticipation<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.100> this<00:00:57.309> ball<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.640> to

move a little to the left i'm going to
set<00:00:59.980> up<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> ball<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.670> my<00:01:00.760> normal<00:01:00.820> address

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
set up to the ball in my normal address

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.910 
set up to the ball in my normal address
position<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:02.140> then<00:01:02.350> i'm<00:01:02.469> going<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.620> let<00:01:02.770> my

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
position and then i'm going to let my

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.740 
position and then i'm going to let my
arms<00:01:03.219> hang<00:01:03.489> where<00:01:03.760> they<00:01:03.910> normally<00:01:04.390> would<00:01:04.600> and

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
arms hang where they normally would and

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.990 
arms hang where they normally would and
you<00:01:05.259> can<00:01:05.410> see<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:05.649> puts<00:01:06.070> my<00:01:06.250> hands<00:01:06.490> down<00:01:06.789> the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
you can see that puts my hands down the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.910 
you can see that puts my hands down the
grip<00:01:07.210> slightly<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.930> that's<00:01:08.440> how<00:01:08.680> i'm<00:01:08.770> going

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
grip slightly and that's how i'm going

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920 
grip slightly and that's how i'm going
to<00:01:08.979> account<00:01:09.490> for<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.820> fact<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.240> balls<00:01:10.450> higher

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
to account for the fact the balls higher

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.410 
to account for the fact the balls higher
than<00:01:11.350> my<00:01:11.590> feet<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.789> i'm<00:01:12.880> going<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.060> set<00:01:13.300> up

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
than my feet so i'm going to set up

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.330 
than my feet so i'm going to set up
there<00:01:13.780> i<00:01:13.990> have<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.289> couple<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.649> practice<00:01:15.100> swings

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
there i have a couple of practice swings

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.070 
there i have a couple of practice swings
so<00:01:15.490> i<00:01:15.520> can<00:01:15.700> get<00:01:15.819> that<00:01:16.030> feeling<00:01:16.569> of<00:01:16.630> where<00:01:16.899> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
so i can get that feeling of where the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.540 
so i can get that feeling of where the
club<00:01:17.319> is<00:01:17.380> going<00:01:17.709> to<00:01:17.770> hit<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.069> turf<00:01:20.369> keep<00:01:21.369> in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
club is going to hit the turf keep in

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.279 
club is going to hit the turf keep in
mind<00:01:21.850> also<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.390> if<00:01:22.690> i'm<00:01:22.840> going<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.050> grip<00:01:23.259> down

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
mind also that if i'm going to grip down

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.809 
mind also that if i'm going to grip down
the<00:01:23.590> club<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> little<00:01:23.979> bit<00:01:24.310> this<00:01:24.429> ball<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.729> going

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
the club a little bit this ball is going

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.550 
the club a little bit this ball is going
to<00:01:24.940> fly<00:01:25.119> furthest<00:01:25.630> I've<00:01:25.780> taken<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.140> little<00:01:26.319> more

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
to fly furthest I've taken a little more

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.139 
to fly furthest I've taken a little more
club<00:01:26.800> than<00:01:26.979> I<00:01:27.069> normally<00:01:27.310> would<00:01:27.580> from<00:01:27.970> this

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
club than I normally would from this

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.480 
club than I normally would from this
distance<00:01:28.630> I'm<00:01:29.410> then<00:01:29.740> going<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.950> set<00:01:30.160> up<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.369> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
distance I'm then going to set up to the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.040 
distance I'm then going to set up to the
ball<00:01:30.520> I'm<00:01:31.149> going<00:01:31.300> to<00:01:31.360> aim<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> little<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
ball I'm going to aim a little to the
