people were thinking that it was going

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to be a walk in the park but no no group

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and World Cup competition is and you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.100 
and World Cup competition is and you
know<00:01:16.380> maybe<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.670> bit

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
know maybe a little a little bit

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
know maybe a little a little bit
disappointed<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.290> England's<00:01:20.100> standpoint

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
disappointed from England's standpoint

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.140 
disappointed from England's standpoint
but<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.950> our<00:01:22.950> benefit<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.909> too

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
but that was to our benefit and then too

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
but that was to our benefit and then too
I<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.170> both<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> game<00:01:26.040> against

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I think in both the game against

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.620 
I think in both the game against
slovenia<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.119> been<00:01:27.240> knocked<00:01:27.479> out

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
slovenia we could have been knocked out

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
slovenia we could have been knocked out
scored<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> late<00:01:28.170> goal<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.799> then

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
scored a late goal there and then

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.319 
scored a late goal there and then
algeria<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.670> could<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.909> been<00:01:30.000> knocked<00:01:30.180> out

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
algeria we could have been knocked out

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.240 
algeria we could have been knocked out

was watching the US and following fall
in<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> u.s.<00:02:10.940> more<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.390> than<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.290> England

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
in the u.s. more so than the the England

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.309 
in the u.s. more so than the the England
theme<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:14.270> hard<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:14.569> me<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.870> comment<00:02:15.050> on

theme so it's hard for me to comment on

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.440 
theme so it's hard for me to comment on
why<00:02:15.590> things<00:02:15.950> went<00:02:16.520> wrong<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:16.970> they<00:02:17.150> didn't

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
why things went wrong but they didn't

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
why things went wrong but they didn't
them<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:18.290> they<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.440> have<00:02:18.650> some<00:02:18.800> good<00:02:18.830> players

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
them but they do have some good players

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.800 
them but they do have some good players
and<00:02:19.340> they're<00:02:20.060> gonna<00:02:20.180> they're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and they're gonna they're going to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.780 
and they're gonna they're going to
bounce<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:21.200> for<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> for<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.069> euros<00:02:22.610> I'm

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
bounce back for the for the euros I'm

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.410 
bounce back for the for the euros I'm
sure<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:24.020> think<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.290> right<00:02:24.470> team<00:02:24.739> won<00:02:25.420> yeah

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
sure you think the right team won yeah

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.870 
sure you think the right team won yeah
probably<00:02:26.690> overall<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> did<00:02:28.640> think

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
probably overall you know I did think

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.670 
probably overall you know I did think
Brazil<00:02:29.420> had<00:02:29.720> their<00:02:29.870> moments<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.500> think

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
Brazil had their moments and I think

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.880 
Brazil had their moments and I think
argentina<00:02:31.130> had<00:02:31.340> their<00:02:31.520> moments<00:02:32.709> Germany<00:02:33.709> look

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
argentina had their moments Germany look

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.580 
argentina had their moments Germany look
look<00:02:34.520> very<00:02:34.940> good<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.630> think<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
look very good I think it was just the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770 
look very good I think it was just the
one<00:02:36.980> side<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.880> brackets<00:02:38.330> when<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.630> was

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
one side of the the brackets when it was

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.140 
one side of the the brackets when it was
coming<00:02:39.140> down<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> knockout<00:02:39.820> stages<00:02:40.820> was<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
coming down to the knockout stages was a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.449 
coming down to the knockout stages was a
little<00:02:41.420> bit<00:02:41.510> more<00:02:41.690> difficult<00:02:41.870> than<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.709> other

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
little bit more difficult than the other

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.070 
little bit more difficult than the other
the<00:02:43.910> other<00:02:44.030> side<00:02:44.300> and<00:02:45.160> thought<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.400> Uruguay

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
the other side and thought the Uruguay

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.050 
the other side and thought the Uruguay
was<00:02:48.080> was<00:02:48.410> probably<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> 11<00:02:49.519> surprise<00:02:49.880> it

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
was was probably the 11 surprise it

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360 
was was probably the 11 surprise it
going<00:02:50.330> as<00:02:50.510> far<00:02:50.900> as<00:02:51.110> they<00:02:51.350> far<00:02:51.830> as<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.069> did<00:02:52.100> but

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
going as far as they far as they did but

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.670 
going as far as they far as they did but
they<00:02:52.400> had<00:02:52.670> very<00:02:53.209> good<00:02:53.330> strike<00:02:53.720> force<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.260> for

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
they had very good strike force and for

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.030 
they had very good strike force and for
long<00:02:54.860> Suarez<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.580> played<00:02:56.830> remarkably<00:02:57.830> well

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
long Suarez and played remarkably well

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.410 
long Suarez and played remarkably well
for<00:02:58.069> them<00:02:58.370> because<00:02:58.550> they<00:02:58.760> were<00:02:58.790> really<00:02:59.300> in

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
for them because they were really in

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
for them because they were really in
certain<00:02:59.750> games<00:02:59.780> on<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> attack<00:03:00.500> with<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.769> two

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
certain games on the attack with the two

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.860 
certain games on the attack with the two
three<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.640> four<00:03:01.790> players<00:03:02.000> but<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.750> was

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
three and four players but that was

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.949 
three and four players but that was
exciting<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.440> was<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.769> was<00:03:03.890> good<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.160> probably

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
exciting it was it was good and probably

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.610 
exciting it was it was good and probably
Spain<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.100> was<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.989> was<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.019> correct
