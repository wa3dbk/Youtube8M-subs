we<00:00:00.750> want<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.989> divide<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.260> decimal<00:00:01.350> by<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> whole

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
we want to divide a decimal by a whole

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.070 
we want to divide a decimal by a whole
number<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:03.240> we<00:00:03.360> have<00:00:03.480> four<00:00:03.720> point<00:00:04.020> three

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
number here we have four point three

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.309 
number here we have four point three
divided<00:00:04.770> by<00:00:04.799> two<00:00:05.000> and<00:00:06.000> here<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.600> seven

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
divided by two and here we have seven

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
divided by two and here we have seven
point<00:00:07.620> eight<00:00:07.799> three<00:00:07.859> divided<00:00:08.700> by<00:00:08.820> nine

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
point eight three divided by nine

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.240 
point eight three divided by nine
remember<00:00:10.080> division<00:00:10.290> can<00:00:10.559> be<00:00:10.650> expressed<00:00:11.099> in

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
remember division can be expressed in

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
remember division can be expressed in
several<00:00:11.639> ways<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.150> divide<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> decimal<00:00:12.990> by<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
several ways to divide a decimal by a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.740 
several ways to divide a decimal by a
whole<00:00:13.860> number<00:00:14.070> we'll<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.580> rewrite<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.509> as

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
whole number we'll first rewrite this as

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410 
whole number we'll first rewrite this as
a<00:00:16.470> long<00:00:16.800> division<00:00:17.100> problem<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:18.180> we'll<00:00:18.300> have

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
a long division problem so we'll have

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.040 
a long division problem so we'll have
four<00:00:18.690> point<00:00:19.020> three<00:00:22.039> divided<00:00:23.039> by<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> this

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
four point three divided by two and this

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.929 
four point three divided by two and this
is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.260> pretty<00:00:25.529> straightforward<00:00:26.189> process<00:00:26.369> when

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
is a pretty straightforward process when

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
is a pretty straightforward process when
dividing<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> whole<00:00:27.869> number<00:00:28.010> what<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.099> need

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
dividing by a whole number what we need

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
dividing by a whole number what we need
to<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.609> take<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.970> decimal<00:00:30.300> point<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to do is take this decimal point and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.340 
to do is take this decimal point and
move<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.650> up<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.219> quotient<00:00:33.050> once<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.200> do

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
move it up into our quotient once we do

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.020 
move it up into our quotient once we do
this<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.770> divide<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.460> normally<00:00:35.610> would

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this we can divide as we normally would

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.959 
this we can divide as we normally would
we<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.140> asked<00:00:37.530> how<00:00:37.649> many<00:00:37.739> twos<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.579> 4

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
we first asked how many twos are on 4

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
we first asked how many twos are on 4
that<00:00:39.210> would<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.360> 2<00:00:39.559> two<00:00:40.559> times<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.219> four

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that would be 2 two times two is four

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660 
that would be 2 two times two is four
and<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.960> subtract<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:44.040> would<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.309> zero

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and now we subtract that would be zero

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.209 
and now we subtract that would be zero
and<00:00:45.289> now<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.500> already<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.829> our<00:00:46.860> decimal

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and now that we already have our decimal

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
and now that we already have our decimal
point<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.670> our<00:00:47.789> quotient<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.930> go<00:00:49.020> ahead

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
point in our quotient we can go ahead

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
point in our quotient we can go ahead
and<00:00:49.320> ignore<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.920> we'll<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.070> bring<00:00:50.399> down

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and ignore it so we'll just bring down

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.689 
and ignore it so we'll just bring down
the<00:00:50.789> next<00:00:50.940> digit<00:00:51.210> which<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> three<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.640> we

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the next digit which is three and now we

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.279 
the next digit which is three and now we
need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.879> determine<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.480> many<00:00:54.539> twos<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.170> on

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
need to determine how many twos are on

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.069 
need to determine how many twos are on
three<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.750> one<00:00:57.750> times

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
three and that would be one one times

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.090 
three and that would be one one times
two<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.649> and<00:01:00.289> we<00:01:01.289> subtract<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
two is two and we subtract and that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.939 
two is two and we subtract and that
would<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.660> but<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.809> dividing<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> decimal

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
would be one but when dividing a decimal

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
would be one but when dividing a decimal
by<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> whole<00:01:05.400> number<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.270> can't<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
by a whole number we can't use the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870 
by a whole number we can't use the
remainder<00:01:07.260> notation<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> keep

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
remainder notation we have to keep

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
remainder notation we have to keep
dividing<00:01:09.260> until<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.439> decimal<00:01:11.070> either

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
dividing until this decimal either

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
dividing until this decimal either
terminates<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.180> starts<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> repeat<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
terminates or starts to repeat so the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
terminates or starts to repeat so the
way<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.119> add<00:01:15.299> extra<00:01:16.140> zeros

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
way we do that is we can add extra zeros

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.580 
way we do that is we can add extra zeros
here<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> end<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> four<00:01:18.119> point<00:01:18.420> three

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
here on the end of four point three

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
here on the end of four point three
remember<00:01:19.590> adding<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> zero<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.180> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
remember adding a zero to it would be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
remember adding a zero to it would be
the<00:01:21.330> hundredths<00:01:22.049> place<00:01:22.080> value<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.490> going

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the hundredths place value is not going

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.929 
the hundredths place value is not going
to<00:01:23.850> change<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> value<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> four<00:01:25.049> point<00:01:25.320> three

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
to change the value of four point three

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
to change the value of four point three
so<00:01:26.939> once<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> digit<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> bring

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so once we have this digit we can bring

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
so once we have this digit we can bring
it<00:01:28.470> down<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.490> ask<00:01:29.759> how<00:01:30.030> many<00:01:30.119> twos<00:01:30.509> are

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it down and then ask how many twos are

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.980 
it down and then ask how many twos are
on<00:01:31.049> ten<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.490> five<00:01:32.850> twos<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> ten

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
on ten well there are five twos and ten

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.730 
on ten well there are five twos and ten
two<00:01:34.829> times<00:01:35.189> five<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.549> ten<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.530> now<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.710> we

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
two times five is ten and now when we

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
two times five is ten and now when we
subtract<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> difference<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.030> zero<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.200> we're

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
subtract the difference is zero so we're

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
subtract the difference is zero so we're
done

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
done

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
done
which<00:01:41.310> means<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.790> decimal<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.299> terminating

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
which means this decimal is terminating

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.090 
which means this decimal is terminating
and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.470> quotient<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.479> 2.15<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.930> 2<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> 15

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and the quotient is 2.15 or 2 and 15

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.120 
and the quotient is 2.15 or 2 and 15
hundredths<00:01:51.049> our<00:01:52.049> second<00:01:52.350> example<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.890> written

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
hundredths our second example is written

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.639 
hundredths our second example is written
in<00:01:53.280> fraction<00:01:53.460> form<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> fraction<00:01:54.960> bar<00:01:55.320> does

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
in fraction form but a fraction bar does

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
in fraction form but a fraction bar does
represent<00:01:55.890> division<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.270> we'll<00:01:57.420> set<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.719> up

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
represent division so we'll set this up

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.130 
represent division so we'll set this up
in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.380> way<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.219> seven<00:02:00.140> point

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
in the same way we have seven point

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
in the same way we have seven point
eight<00:02:01.350> three<00:02:03.110> divided<00:02:04.110> by<00:02:04.140> nine<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.610> again<00:02:06.540> as

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
eight three divided by nine and again as

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.020 
eight three divided by nine and again as
long<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.810> we're<00:02:07.079> dividing<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> whole<00:02:07.920> number

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
long as we're dividing by a whole number

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.190 
long as we're dividing by a whole number
we<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.060> need<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.390> move<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> decimal<00:02:09.810> point

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
we just need to move the decimal point

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770 
we just need to move the decimal point
up<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.950> our<00:02:11.099> quotient<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.629> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
up into our quotient and then we can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
up into our quotient and then we can
divide<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.379> we<00:02:13.410> normally

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
divide as we normally

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.910 
divide as we normally
would<00:02:14.270> disregarding<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> decimal<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.890> we

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
would disregarding the decimal so we

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
would disregarding the decimal so we
first<00:02:17.310> need<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.520> determine<00:02:17.730> how<00:02:18.000> many<00:02:18.060> nines

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
first need to determine how many nines

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.330 
first need to determine how many nines
there<00:02:18.810> would<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.349> 78<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.830> would<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.069> 8

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
there would be in 78 and that would be 8

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
there would be in 78 and that would be 8
because<00:02:23.610> 8<00:02:23.819> times<00:02:24.060> 9<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.690> 72<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.780> long<00:02:28.019> as

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
because 8 times 9 is 72 and as long as

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.110 
because 8 times 9 is 72 and as long as
this<00:02:28.260> difference<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.890> less<00:02:28.920> than<00:02:29.280> 9<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:30.000> know

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
this difference is less than 9 we know

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.680 
this difference is less than 9 we know
this<00:02:30.330> 8<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.750> correct<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.459> we<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.790> 6<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.599> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
this 8 is correct so we have 6 and this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
this 8 is correct so we have 6 and this
would<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.989> 0<00:02:34.430> bring<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> next<00:02:35.940> digit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
would be 0 bring down the next digit

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.410 
would be 0 bring down the next digit
which<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.660> 3<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.069> now<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.489> ask<00:02:38.730> how<00:02:39.000> many<00:02:39.090> nines

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
which is 3 and now we ask how many nines

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
which is 3 and now we ask how many nines
there<00:02:39.720> are<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.549> 63<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:43.080> would<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.349> 7<00:02:43.739> 7<00:02:44.220> times

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
there are in 63 that would be 7 7 times

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.009 
there are in 63 that would be 7 7 times
9<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:44.940> 63<00:02:45.799> this<00:02:46.799> difference<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.430> 0<00:02:47.790> we've<00:02:48.720> used

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
9 is 63 this difference is 0 we've used

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.289 
9 is 63 this difference is 0 we've used
all<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> digits<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:49.950> we're<00:02:50.099> done<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.150> this

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
all of the digits so we're done so this

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.280 
all of the digits so we're done so this
