00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.920
 On the way singing and laughing birds we have a cow rosettes having 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.260
 filled the car with everything we went down one over the other then they 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.070

 our eyes 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.660
 We got to the lake and took things out of the car. 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.510
 I set up the barbecue when I realized I had no charcoal. 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.530
 therefore 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 after all we were as we should 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.050
 I went to get the water and it did not have water only soda was here for 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.570
 my joy I found a lot of 2 liters 'doritos' 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.480
 we started to harvest and we were all happy for the right to skip the day 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 we wanted to swim and we do not have to cover that grass 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.940
 and it was very hard on it 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.910
 comes a storm that destroyed the tents with the strong wind we stayed 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.720
 Stew checked and we decided to go to sleep in the car but it did not work 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.709

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.659

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.629
 early in the morning we left and on the way back we found the azera 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.230
 we puzzled down and tried to figure out why it was close up white 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:48.709
 we thought back to the car I realized that the glass had a rose shade 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.899
