00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
just a little bit of finished carpentry

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
just a little bit of finished carpentry
you<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.329> sure<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> same

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you got to make sure you have the same

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.890 
you got to make sure you have the same
gap<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.970> other<00:01:06.150> words<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.689> piece

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
gap here in other words when this piece

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
gap here in other words when this piece
goes<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.470> gonna<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
goes in it's gonna be like this so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
goes in it's gonna be like this so
they'll<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> quarter<00:01:09.630> inch<00:01:09.780> gap<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they'll be a quarter inch gap there you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
they'll be a quarter inch gap there you
can't<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> let<00:01:11.970> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
can't you know you have to let this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
can't you know you have to let this
floor<00:01:12.390> move<00:01:12.860> remember<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> floor<00:01:14.189> wants<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
floor move remember the floor wants to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
floor move remember the floor wants to
slide<00:01:14.970> left<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.530> forth

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
slide left and right and back and forth

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.560 
slide left and right and back and forth
it<00:01:16.979> needs<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> expanding<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.060> track<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it needs to expanding a track like a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
it needs to expanding a track like a
balloon<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.700> almost

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
balloon so that's about it it's almost

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
balloon so that's about it it's almost
finished<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> next<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
finished I think the next video that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
finished I think the next video that
you'll<00:01:22.890> see<00:01:23.070> I'll<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:24.000> ahead<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> shoot

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you'll see I'll just go ahead and shoot

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
you'll see I'll just go ahead and shoot
it<00:01:24.689> after<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> floor<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> completely

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it after the floor is completely

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.320 
it after the floor is completely
finished<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.580> understand<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
finished I think you understand what to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.230 
finished I think you understand what to
do<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.920> cuts<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.310> end<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> hard

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
do the cuts at the end are not that hard

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
do the cuts at the end are not that hard
it's<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.079> regular<00:01:31.439> carpentry

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it's you know just regular carpentry

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
it's you know just regular carpentry
just<00:01:33.119> measure<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.079> through<00:01:34.229> before

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
just measure and think it through before

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
just measure and think it through before
you<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.310> cut<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.360> make<00:01:36.540> sure<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> cut

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you you cut you know make sure you cut

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.899 
you you cut you know make sure you cut
the<00:01:37.350> wrong<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.460> sure<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.670> cut<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the wrong you know make sure you cut the
