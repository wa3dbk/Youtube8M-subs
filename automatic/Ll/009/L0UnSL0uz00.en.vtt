00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 greetings to all readers of hdblog e 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.280
 welcome this video preview 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 dedicated in rule warriors when 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.910
 nintendo announces the role and warriors 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.070
 we finally saw the light in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 back to the tunnel as the new one is now known 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.600
 spin off of the legend of zelda series 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.090
 is practically based on the classic 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 conception of a genre that has its own 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 part dynasty style exponents 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 similar warriors 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.199
 but our hope is that of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.969
 see a title the same way as 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 warriors orochi but given was able 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.140
 despise green from all new 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 macbook air is the team no doubt anymore 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 expert in adventure psychology of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 consequently nintendo decided to entrust 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 to them his gesture of development will hold 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.550
 then collected the various heroes and villains 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.710
 of the saga the legend of zelda and i 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 years or catapulted into the world 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 characterized by barrel rows orbs 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 minutes from beating the territory from 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
 conquer and much more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 the gameplay is classically based on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 possibility of ringing with two 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 according to the whole marked by two keys 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.460
 dedicated to attack 1 for effects 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 downloadable specials plot a special 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 bar and car for the evasion therefore 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 nothing new we are facing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.430
 to the typical elements that have always been 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.320
 feature 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 the future therefore we cannot 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.890
 actually claim to be al 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.820
 before a product really 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.100
 innovative 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.900
 but the universe makes the difference 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.940
 examined the presence of the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.250
 characters from the legend of zelda 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 it is undoubtedly very interesting 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.850
 without counting the insertion and some 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.790
 adds cultured hands directly 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 from the original saga exploring the various 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.540
 zone will therefore be possible to open 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.860
 treasure chest find treasure and above all 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.110
 deal with the various bosses 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.570
 tecmo koei has also included the same 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.759
 type of target of the enemies of steno 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 nice to stay in other students so 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.170
 to make the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 camera management during 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.290
 the solution definitely fighter 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.479
 very inspired and we think that 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.460
 developers will fall back on this 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.350
 option also in the next chapters ti 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.149
 will give you want our alter ego 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.729
 virtual will be able to exploit different 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.130
 types of weapons both principal and 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 therefore, additional minor returns are added 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.570
 like bugani bombs to all those 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.890
 sting tools the legend of zelda 20 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.590
 is obviously the main character 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.540
 even if the colors will actually be 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.489
 painters secondary characters each 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 warrior will be able to aim his life differently 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.940
 but all is embellished by the presence 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.340
 of weapons capable of upsetting 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.410
 completely fighting style 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.599
 may be alternated with instruments 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.790
 offensive from a distance explore the various ones 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.860
 zone will mean getting your hands on 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.050
 really amazing equipment that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.550
 above all there is the possibility of 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.640
 level your virtual alter ego 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.860
 in perfect gdr style the gamers 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.170
 they will then be ready to test with their hands 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.810
 different exponents of the team in order to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.730
 find your own virtual alter ego 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.170
 favorite and talked about it perfectly 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.330
 grow your character 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 therefore means having from one's own 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.130
 passive skills and always a powerful one 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.319
 fusion of skills and much more 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.360
 we were impressed by the massive 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.190
 subquest dose present in each 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.079
 mission will indeed happen to have to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.230
 run from one side to the other of the 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.700
 map activate a particular hotspot 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.110
 assist a cutscene and then resume 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.269
 the devastation of the enemies 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.500
 everything is particularly taken care of 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.690
 is able to break the monotony 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.849
 of the graduated battles of the agenda 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.099
 zelda also breathes in clashes with 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.810
 the bosses present in the various locations i 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.819
 most resistant monsters will have to be 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.769
 designed to match the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.930
 pattern and act accordingly 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.880
 in these cases it will therefore be necessary 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.520
 set aside the button practice 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.800
 smashing and pulling out the house 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.930
 during the first hours of play there is no 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.700
 we stopped to analyze the engine 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.980
 graph too thoroughly 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.840
 However, a great job leaps to the eye a 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.130
 character design level as of 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.200
 rest at an environmental level 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.540
 the locations, however, seem too much 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
 spoils a pop up effect is more alive than 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.090
 never 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.590
 we are identical during the coffins 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.900
 of roll and warriors votes 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.000
 seems actually confirmed in 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.430
 wall type is unfortunately a typology of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.320
 halfway game by the really high ones 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.240
 even if the decision to immerse 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.730
 the tv universe and legend of zelda a 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.740
 title sting from well to simonian could 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.080
 give some track never seen before 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.090
 from now for this short preview video e 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.160
 all thanks for being with us e 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.080
 we are waiting for you on our pages
