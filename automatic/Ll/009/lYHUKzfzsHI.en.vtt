00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:11.880
 yes dear 1000 best was too much I am 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.590
 here in the stand of peter michael dear 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.210
 but now I'll say the only one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.190
 alternative the only challenger 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.869
 still left is good last against 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 Qatar we are ready the offer here 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.680
 already and I think now is for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 you also come the time that I 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.070
 more widespread but also I say 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 the story of you with the beta 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220
 to be a little bit alive 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 and I believe has a quite 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.949
 interesting model also produced 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 yes we see that too 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.469
 so we are very happy just this 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 this niche where also the competition 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.020
 meanwhile realized that it too 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.300
 interesting that below the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
 competition vehicles again vehicle too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 present 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.960
 but in the usual way for us 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.520
 interpret motorcycle what just that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.590
 reenter or even the one who 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.989
 beginner enduro sport simply maximum 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 supported by the concept so not her 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.559
 so screwed up but very 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.359
 easy the driver friendly 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.589
 Engine characteristic has vehicle 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.439
 has some lubrication trends 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.909
 absolute novelty in the field sport area 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.590
 So maximum handling friendliness 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.939
 and to a summer 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.560
 clearly you have your price you have 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.060
 maybe the sport as usual 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 is okay maybe the once believes 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.119
 hard facts art name weight engine farmer 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.909
 and these things are pragmatic 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.299
 series like father as a cost trainer 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.009
 comes the 300 kubik two stroke variant 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.140
 So a motor of our sport 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.549
 enduro adapted but over the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.560
 control and over the entire 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.570
 design is very high torque 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.130
 oriented then that is done 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.860
 is has yet significantly less 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 performance but here the driveability 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.130
 or handling in the foreground 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.030
 should be helpful 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.670
 I mentioned reduced spring travel 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 has separate lubrication but otherwise 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.969
 just remember everyone had one too 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 sport andor has so very robust 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.930
 execution massive frame but very 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.780
 very easy he just under 100 kilo 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 We are roughly at stake 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 i say good 15 15 percent see 12 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.470
 15 percent among sports a bus and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 thus simply the range of use 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.910
 far to expand for the just not 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 competitive is on the way 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.270
 or maybe do technical training 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.069
 what the vehicle also wants clear 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.260
 relieved ok I imagine that now 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.660
 relatively pleasant in front of the engine a lot 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.580
 torque of 160 x also that it with 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.560
 the traction then have wonderful 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 is jauch is also in the had 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.790
 but a high quality 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.900
 impression of the price so what 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.700
 now you create 8000 then 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 in any case fall below 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.680
 must be the goal it must be the goal 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 in my sport on duras today that is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 yes that's a serious one 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.349
 Price level in the one but because of it 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 is also a motorsport device which is extreme 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.709
 You also have to say a lot 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.000
 conditions are extremely tough 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.840
 trend to the hard enduro race where 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.670
 material destruction here, so to speak 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.780
 already in the notebook it must be the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.909
 Keeping vehicles out is therefore 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.290
 executed accordingly but also leads 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.879
 to speak a price level here 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.519
 Let's try in the overall design 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.420
 the other range of application beside 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.069
 to bear the bill 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.450
 that means everything in the hobby area 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.560
 You can take place with the motorcycle 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.810
 perfectly cover 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.280
 and although the price is not yet 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.090
 we are calculated at short notice 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.590
 can announce 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.390
 I assume that he is 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.459
 okay then sign in the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.769
 practicality for the people who 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.610
 not freaks right now 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 two- stroke engine had the huge advantage 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.319
 that in terms of cost in the 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.120
 purchase but also in operation 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.099
 is subject to the choice always that was 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.930
 the bitterest thing already said separately 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.180
 already lubrication you have to stop four 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.280
 gasoline and two current thrive 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.959
 normal people reasonable so ins 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.459
 overall concept yes where i believe that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.280
 could work well 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.749
 Of course, now you know personally 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.939
 in austria germany quite completely 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.200
 a lot of travel a dealer network is already 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.549
 it has become denser 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.620
 so far challenge so now 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.689
 He should also easy to the motorcycle too 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.560
 I 'll get everywhere or yes 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.780
 believe that we meanwhile 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.180
 It was on the very good way 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.739
 Of course , five more years where we are now 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.510
 have made this change the 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.730
 from the former importers sales network 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 in a direct distribution network we 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.680
 Today there are over 36 distributors in 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.889
 Austria and have some 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.110
 leading also a dealer bewerbung 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.970
 and I think that that's relative 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.310
 good territorial cover too 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.720
 offers you have it here again 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.000
 addressed the manageability 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.210
 So that was just part of the concept 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.710
 two-stroke engine is easier per se 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.330
 in the Vaud and cheaper in the wait 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.919
 cheaper in the production 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.750
 isolated lubrication quite consciously here 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.550
 chosen because one does not just with the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.380
 broached the oil deal 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.510
 you have tank normalbenzin and the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.540
 fulfillment that holds a lot over 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.580
 several 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.740
 tank filling and that's just coming 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.600
 is controlled again so targeted 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.280
 controlled that just the oil consumption 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.040
 clearly minimized is thus synonymous 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.110
 Pollution of the environment also et cetera 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.030
 not happen here so just 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.800
 also a technological step in the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.950
 right direction plus hands 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.420
 Advantages a good friend and C is for 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.980
 Of course we are very sympathetic 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.080
 history few of the 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.710
 new is the competition 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.540
 come 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.270
 that inspires all to come new ones 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.290
 products from whence come when a 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.730
 be available when can you be so 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.450
 Dealers agree with this 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.250
 attack 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.860
 yes that's far too much of our 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.469
 I'm done honestly 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 and who are looking at that yes 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.159
 maybe the motorsport affine us 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.689
 have an overhang at the moment 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.159
 Demand to the offer that 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.259
 means we operate a bit out of the 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.120
 reserve out we have partial 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.460
 We accept orders only 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.259
 in february I can go meet 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.639
 assuming that he has this vehicle in the 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.969
 order of magnitude february march available 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.439
 then they can also serve 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.270
 at the moment we are building the big sports 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.620
 enduros the people must be in want 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.900
 prepare for the new season 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.610
 we have to run extremely that's it 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.219
 a bit the challenge with too 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.289
 This growth is easy to manage 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.710
 no problem the sportsmen can 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.819
 now in winter on the sandpiste 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.770
 we will wait until March 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.590
 then drive in sunny temperatures 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.189
 cozy exit thank you michael for 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.189
 the words
