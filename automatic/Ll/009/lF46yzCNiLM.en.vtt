00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello youtube friends in our 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.890
 we must teach them then we are going to 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.620
 make an automatic network gate are 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.420
 with that good record the first thing that 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.400
 we have to do is have in these 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.400
 materials glass 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.840
 the sticky piston obviously 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.270
 a good night torch in the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.270
 redstone pressure pest 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 and they are also in addition to that a cube 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.500
 anyone could I go to choose the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 same earth 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 do not forget 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.660
 pretty simple good let's start 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.570
 first we have to see the 3 here 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.879
 good and we leave a space to stay 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.910
 so that the key part so that the 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.869
 ribbon open and end here so 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.220
 we both have three other spaces and here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.670
 and we put this good here we put the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.670
 glasses 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.280
 here until here is the simplest part 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:25.330
 here we are going to put a red ton torch 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.580
 and here is for it to open they will be here 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.740
 let's put the cube either for 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.200
 that these activate so that the torch 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.869
 activate him 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.540
 the piston next to us and up here we go 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.470
 to put a rest 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.490
 and well as you can see, it is missing but 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.009
 can be closed 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.009
 therefore we must 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.570
 we will see you 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 I accept that I will point out to leave like this 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.740
 distance to a rectangle square 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.410
 be here around 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.099
 and here we break here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.830
 it's good here we'll put this and we'll 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.830
 surround network are 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:36.010
 there's going to be surrounded by redstone 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.450
 and we go with the cube anybody has covered 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.960
 these 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.460
 important not to cover this I will not touch this 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.450
 game because if not the connection of the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.420
 short stays it cuts good and there 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.910
 come on let's cover we cover all 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.500
 remember less this minus this because 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.920
 if not already with him being resist is cut 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.400
 finally we are going to put the plates of 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 Pressure 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.380
 and there it goes going and ready once they pass 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.740
 it will open 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.950
 good 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.750
 And then you are covering him there 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 as you wish to make it more 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.850
 pretty do not know if they looked for it for a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.910
 server or for one of your worlds 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.570
 and you see 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.150
 well I understand good friends if you 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.810
