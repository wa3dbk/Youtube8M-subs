over<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:30.500> once<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> have<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.550> done<00:02:34.510> go

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
over and then once you have that done go

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.290 
over and then once you have that done go
down<00:02:35.870> 25<00:02:36.620> blocks<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.160> think<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:37.490> 27<00:02:38.180> blocks

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
down 25 blocks I think this 27 blocks

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.000 
down 25 blocks I think this 27 blocks
and<00:02:39.850> boom<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.420> animal<00:02:41.900> spawn<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.380> it's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and boom you have animal spawn and it's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.490 
and boom you have animal spawn and it's
all<00:02:43.310> automatic<00:02:43.820> now<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> only<00:02:44.900> problem<00:02:45.230> with

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
all automatic now the only problem with

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.480 
all automatic now the only problem with
this<00:02:45.620> one<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.870> chickens<00:02:48.190> jump<00:02:49.190> off<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
this one is is chickens jump off the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.540 
this one is is chickens jump off the
walls<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.810> they<00:02:51.110> don't<00:02:51.470> die<00:02:51.950> when<00:02:52.340> they<00:02:52.460> hit

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
walls so they don't die when they hit

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.210 
walls so they don't die when they hit
the<00:02:52.700> ground<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:54.170> that's<00:02:54.380> all<00:02:54.500> good<00:02:54.680> it's<00:02:54.980> okay

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
the ground but that's all good it's okay

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.400 
the ground but that's all good it's okay
because<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.270> still<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.720> chickens<00:02:57.050> spawning

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
because you still have chickens spawning

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.940 
because you still have chickens spawning
down<00:02:57.560> there

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
down there

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.530 
down there
and<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.400> can<00:02:58.520> just<00:02:58.670> kill<00:02:58.970> them<00:02:59.060> yourself

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
and you can just kill them yourself

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.440 
and you can just kill them yourself
they're<00:02:59.840> pleasing<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.489> didn't<00:03:01.880> realize<00:03:02.209> it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
they're pleasing so I didn't realize it

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.320 
they're pleasing so I didn't realize it
was<00:03:02.510> dark<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.080> anyways<00:03:03.500> basically<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.970> you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
was dark but anyways basically as you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.820 
was dark but anyways basically as you
can<00:03:05.360> see<00:03:05.860> nowhere<00:03:06.860> near<00:03:08.050> grassland<00:03:09.050> that's

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
can see nowhere near grassland that's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.630 
can see nowhere near grassland that's
really<00:03:10.580> really<00:03:10.880> important<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:12.680> when<00:03:13.520> you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
really really important and in when you

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.720 
really really important and in when you
see<00:03:13.940> grassland<00:03:14.660> -<00:03:14.930> what<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.320> did<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.370> created

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
see grassland - what I did so I created

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.170 
see grassland - what I did so I created
this<00:03:16.940> first<00:03:17.500> which<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> monster<00:03:19.280> spawn<00:03:19.520> link

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
this first which is a monster spawn link

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.530 
this first which is a monster spawn link
will<00:03:20.360> be<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.810> description<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.580> yeah<00:03:23.330> see

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
will be in the description and yeah see

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.110 
will be in the description and yeah see
right<00:03:23.570> there<00:03:23.930> gunpowder<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.730> just<00:03:25.730> use<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
right there gunpowder I just use that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.520 
right there gunpowder I just use that
and<00:03:26.630> then<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.840> destroyed<00:03:27.680> all<00:03:28.450> grassland

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
and then I destroyed all grassland

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.220 
and then I destroyed all grassland
essentially<00:03:30.530> all<00:03:30.910> around<00:03:31.910> here<00:03:32.209> besides<00:03:32.959> over

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
essentially all around here besides over

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.670 
essentially all around here besides over
here<00:03:34.060> there's<00:03:35.060> also<00:03:35.239> some<00:03:35.660> over<00:03:35.870> here<00:03:35.900> but

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
here there's also some over here but

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.010 
here there's also some over here but
anyways<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.640> destroyed

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
anyways I just destroyed

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.100 
anyways I just destroyed
a<00:03:39.140> lot<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.650> grassland<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.550> it<00:03:41.270> worked<00:03:41.690> really

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
a lot of grassland and it worked really

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.170 
a lot of grassland and it worked really
really<00:03:42.230> well<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.820> yeah<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.560> there's<00:03:45.800> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
really well and yeah and there's the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.810 
really well and yeah and there's the
also<00:03:47.260> needs<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.320> be<00:03:48.410> pretty<00:03:48.770> far<00:03:49.010> not<00:03:49.220> too<00:03:49.520> far

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
also needs to be pretty far not too far

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.510 
also needs to be pretty far not too far
and<00:03:50.390> what<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.960> did<00:03:51.170> after<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.100> just<00:03:52.160> took

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
and what I did after that is I just took

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.940 
and what I did after that is I just took
dirt<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:55.220> made<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.850> huge<00:03:56.240> bridge<00:03:59.440> over<00:04:00.440> here

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
dirt and I made a huge bridge over here

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.080 
dirt and I made a huge bridge over here
I<00:04:00.980> believe<00:04:02.710> right<00:04:03.710> over<00:04:03.920> here<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.580> might<00:04:04.820> like

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I believe right over here I might like

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
I believe right over here I might like
this<00:04:05.270> little<00:04:05.570> bridge<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:11.480> then<00:04:11.660> in<00:04:11.870> there

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
this little bridge and and then in there

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.830 
this little bridge and and then in there
so<00:04:12.670> that's<00:04:13.670> kind<00:04:13.880> of<00:04:13.910> how<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.060> got<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.420> grass<00:04:14.630> to

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
so that's kind of how I got the grass to

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.750 
so that's kind of how I got the grass to
grow<00:04:14.960> in<00:04:15.140> there<00:04:15.290> but<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.770> was<00:04:15.890> really<00:04:16.370> simple

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
grow in there but it was really simple

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.539 
grow in there but it was really simple
to<00:04:17.390> make<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.660> underground<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.739> recommend

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
to make it underground so I recommend

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.390 
to make it underground so I recommend
you<00:04:19.790> making<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.330> underground<00:04:21.040> unless<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.220> go

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
you making it underground unless you go

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.790 
you making it underground unless you go
like<00:04:22.730> way<00:04:23.270> far<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> use<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> bunch<00:04:24.290> of<00:04:24.470> dynamite

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
like way far I use a bunch of dynamite

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.790 
like way far I use a bunch of dynamite
and<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:26.240> blow<00:04:26.480> up<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.810> bunch<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.140> areas<00:04:27.530> or

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and just blow up a bunch of areas or

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.040 
and just blow up a bunch of areas or
whatever<00:04:28.070> but<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.420> know<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.810> was<00:04:29.900> pretty

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
whatever but you know it was pretty

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.220 
whatever but you know it was pretty
simple<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.180> -<00:04:32.180> for<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.840> more<00:04:33.050> in-depth

to<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.540> earlier<00:04:42.170> video<00:04:42.530> where<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.830> explained<00:04:43.280> it

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
to a earlier video where I explained it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.610 
to a earlier video where I explained it
but<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.570> was<00:04:44.690> kind<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.170> was<00:04:45.260> kind<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.470> bad

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
but it was kind of it was kind of bad

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.280 
but it was kind of it was kind of bad
just<00:04:45.950> because<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.750> didn't<00:04:47.750> really<00:04:47.780> tell<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.260> a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
just because it didn't really tell you a

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.310 
just because it didn't really tell you a
really<00:04:48.770> good<00:04:49.100> part<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.730> or<00:04:50.110> essential<00:04:51.110> part

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
really good part of it or essential part

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.170 
really good part of it or essential part
of<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.500> which<00:04:51.980> was<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.340> needs<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.790> be<00:04:52.910> away<00:04:53.120> from

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
of it which was it needs to be away from
