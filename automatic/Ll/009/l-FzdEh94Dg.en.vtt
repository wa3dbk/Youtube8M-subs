colors the color it relates to the sides

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
colors the color it relates to the sides
and<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.030> clear<00:00:45.570> they're<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.230> kind

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and they're all clear they're just kind

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.709 
and they're all clear they're just kind
of<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.739> smoke<00:00:47.280> black<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:48.030> clear<00:00:48.300> black

there's<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> mint<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.190> all

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's a mint and then this is all

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.819 
there's a mint and then this is all
clear<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> polycarbonate<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.500> which

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
clear and as a polycarbonate back which

clear and as a polycarbonate back which
is<00:00:52.980> tough<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.969> hard<00:00:54.329> plastic<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.170> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
is tough so hard plastic for like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.110 
is tough so hard plastic for like
resisting<00:00:56.010> scratching<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> whatnot<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
resisting scratching and whatnot and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660 
resisting scratching and whatnot and
then<00:00:57.600> softer<00:00:58.140> TPU<00:00:58.590> sides<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.399> shock

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
then softer TPU sides for shock

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
then softer TPU sides for shock
absorption<00:00:59.960> they're<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.739> built-in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
absorption they're also these built-in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
absorption they're also these built-in
port<00:01:02.520> protectors<00:01:03.090> along<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> bottom<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.500> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
port protectors along the bottom so I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
port protectors along the bottom so I
have<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> dummy<00:01:05.040> iPhone<00:01:05.489> 6<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.210> will

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
have the dummy iPhone 6 here which will

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
have the dummy iPhone 6 here which will
put<00:01:06.570> inside<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> button<00:01:07.590> side<00:01:07.799> first

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
put inside with the button side first

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100 
put inside with the button side first
and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.030> kind<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> pop<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.020> the

and then just kind of pop it in at the
bottom<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.880> nice<00:01:12.030> tight

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the back there is a kind of oval long

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.010 
the back there is a kind of oval long
shape<00:01:32.640> cut<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> camera<00:01:33.600> secondary

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
shape cut out for the camera secondary

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.899

mic<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> flash<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.640> there

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
mic and flash you can see right there

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
mic and flash you can see right there
and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.689> course<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> clear<00:01:37.740> case

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and then of course this is a clear case

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
and then of course this is a clear case
so<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.310> allows<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> show<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
buttons that are built into the case

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.200 
buttons that are built into the case
these<00:01:49.500> probably<00:01:49.920> give<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> most<00:01:50.729> tactile

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
these probably give the most tactile

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
these probably give the most tactile
feedback<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.810> any<00:01:51.930> case<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.380> type<00:01:52.530> I've

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
feedback of any case of this type I've

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
feedback of any case of this type I've
tested<00:01:53.939> they're<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.659> jelly<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
tested they're really jelly and they

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
tested they're really jelly and they
feel<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.219> click<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.549> them

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
feel really good when you click on them

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
feel really good when you click on them
and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> course<00:01:58.020> another

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and then there is of course another

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
and then there is of course another
cutout<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> mute<00:01:59.100> switch<00:01:59.340> now<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.119> I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
cutout for the mute switch now as I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.520 
cutout for the mute switch now as I
mentioned<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> bottom<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.409> have

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
mentioned on the bottom you do have

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
mentioned on the bottom you do have
three<00:02:01.799> cutouts<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> headset<00:02:03.540> jack

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
three cutouts one for the headset jack

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
three cutouts one for the headset jack
and<00:02:04.079> Mike<00:02:04.409> another<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> Lightning<00:02:05.399> port

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and Mike another for the Lightning port

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370 
and Mike another for the Lightning port
and<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> third<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.360> speaker<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.259> they

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and a third for the speaker but they

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
and a third for the speaker but they
have<00:02:07.469> these<00:02:07.619> port<00:02:07.979> protectors<00:02:08.489> built<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.030> so

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
have these port protectors built in so

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.780 
have these port protectors built in so
you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.080> engage<00:02:10.410> those<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.979> keep<00:02:11.160> dust<00:02:11.459> out

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you can engage those to keep dust out

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
you can engage those to keep dust out
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.480> open<00:02:12.840> them<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.020> when<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> want<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and then open them up when you want to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.770 
and then open them up when you want to
get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.510 
get
to<00:02:13.840> your<00:02:13.990> ports<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.470> charge<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.100> plug<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.430> your

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
to your ports to charge and plug in your

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.100 
to your ports to charge and plug in your
headphone<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.840> an<00:02:16.930> admirable

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
headphone but it will do an admirable

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.380 
headphone but it will do an admirable
job<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.650> keeping<00:02:17.950> dust<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> debris<00:02:18.640> from

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
job of keeping dust and debris from

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.720 
job of keeping dust and debris from
getting<00:02:19.780> inside<00:02:19.990> those<00:02:20.470> ports<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.040> causing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
getting inside those ports and causing

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.360 
getting inside those ports and causing
corrosion<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.410> mentioned<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.950> comes<00:02:24.190> with

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
corrosion so I mentioned it comes with

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.680 
corrosion so I mentioned it comes with
this<00:02:24.490> little<00:02:24.550> template<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.360> what<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.569> do

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
this little template and what you do

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.660 
this little template and what you do
with<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.260> our<00:02:26.890> instructions<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
with this is our instructions on the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.250 
with this is our instructions on the
back<00:02:27.819> but<00:02:28.060> essentially<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.600> print<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.050> your

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
back but essentially you print out your

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.530 
back but essentially you print out your
own<00:02:29.440> design<00:02:29.890> whether<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:30.940> from<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
own design whether it's like from you

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.870 
own design whether it's like from you
know<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.750> Internet<00:02:32.050> or<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.830> photograph<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
know the Internet or a photograph and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.670 
know the Internet or a photograph and
then<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> use<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> trace<00:02:35.050> around<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
then you use this to trace around the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
then you use this to trace around the
design<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.370> then<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.090> create<00:02:37.300> your<00:02:37.420> own

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
design and then you can create your own

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.770 
design and then you can create your own
not<00:02:38.230> clear<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:38.800> custom<00:02:39.250> case<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.030> did<00:02:40.569> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
not clear but custom case so I did that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.229 
not clear but custom case so I did that
right<00:02:41.230> here<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.010> already<00:02:42.310> cut<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> design

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
right here so I already cut out a design

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.479 
right here so I already cut out a design
I<00:02:43.420> printed<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.200> Stoff<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> Internet<00:02:44.890> use

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
I printed this to Stoff the Internet use

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.460 
I printed this to Stoff the Internet use
the<00:02:45.700> template<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.510> know<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.660> cut<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.050> out<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the template you know to cut it out and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.110 
the template you know to cut it out and
then<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.070> just<00:02:48.100> stick<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.550> on<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.820> back<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
then you just stick this on the back of

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.240 
then you just stick this on the back of
your<00:02:49.180> phone<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.709> over<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
your phone and you can do this over and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.400 
your phone and you can do this over and
over<00:02:51.519> again<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:52.060> create<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.989> your<00:02:53.230> own

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
over again to create like your own

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 
over again to create like your own
custom<00:02:53.980> cakes<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.580> then<00:02:54.670> take<00:02:54.910> your<00:02:55.090> phone

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
custom cakes and then take your phone

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.590 
custom cakes and then take your phone
place<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.950> again<00:02:57.489> button<00:02:58.000> side<00:02:58.209> first

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
place it in and again button side first

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.540 
place it in and again button side first
and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.290> click<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.830> in<00:02:59.920> like<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
and then just click it in like so and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.430 
and then just click it in like so and
there<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.180> go<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.569> mean<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.110> could<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.319> this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
there you go I mean you could do this

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.960 
there you go I mean you could do this
every<00:03:02.620> day<00:03:02.950> if<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.130> wanted<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.670> create<00:03:03.940> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
every day if you wanted and create a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.270 
every day if you wanted and create a
different<00:03:04.510> look<00:03:04.540> every<00:03:04.930> single<00:03:05.350> day<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.950> I

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
different look every single day and I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.860 
different look every single day and I
think<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.730> know<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.060> took<00:03:07.239> me<00:03:07.420> about<00:03:07.540> 30

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
think you know this took me about 30

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.870 
think you know this took me about 30
seconds<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.830> no<00:03:09.069> effort<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.550> no<00:03:09.640> thought

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
seconds with no effort and no thought
