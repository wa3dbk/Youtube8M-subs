see<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> arrives<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:54.000> terms<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.510> safety

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
see it as it arrives in terms of safety

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
see it as it arrives in terms of safety
that's<00:01:55.380> our<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.740> priority<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.850> we've<00:01:57.060> built

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that's our top priority so we've built

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
that's our top priority so we've built
the<00:01:57.780> flirty<00:01:58.080> as<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> hexacopter<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the flirty as a hexacopter so it can

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
the flirty as a hexacopter so it can
lose<00:01:59.640> anyone<00:02:00.180> brohter<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.350> fly<00:02:01.620> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
lose anyone brohter and still fly that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
lose anyone brohter and still fly that
can<00:02:02.250> lose<00:02:02.430> any<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.850> battery<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.479> still<00:02:03.720> fly

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
can lose any one battery and still fly

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.110 
can lose any one battery and still fly
so<00:02:04.560> we're<00:02:04.710> putting<00:02:04.890> safety<00:02:05.190> first<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.970> order

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
so we're putting safety first in order

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
leading engineering organizations in the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.270 
leading engineering organizations in the
southern<00:03:17.230> hemisphere<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.920> they're

southern hemisphere and they're

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.399 
southern hemisphere and they're
supporting<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.790> concept<00:03:19.180> demonstration<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.290> a

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
supporting a concept demonstration of a

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.110 
supporting a concept demonstration of a
textbook<00:03:20.709> delivery<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.400> campus<00:03:21.879> of<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
textbook delivery on campus of the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.569 
textbook delivery on campus of the
university<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:23.709> it's<00:03:24.129> more<00:03:24.340> than<00:03:24.519> that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
university but it's more than that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.940 
university but it's more than that
because<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:25.180> warrant<00:03:25.389> center<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.049> leading

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
because the warrant center is leading

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.559 
because the warrant center is leading
the<00:03:27.940> development<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.840> protocol<00:03:29.380> for

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
the development of a protocol for

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.360 
the development of a protocol for
voluntary<00:03:31.569> industry<00:03:32.139> conduct<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.280> we

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
voluntary industry conduct so that we

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.370 
voluntary industry conduct so that we
can<00:03:33.519> actually<00:03:33.669> engage<00:03:34.180> with<00:03:34.209> community<00:03:35.019> with

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
can actually engage with community with

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.680 
can actually engage with community with
people<00:03:35.410> concern<00:03:36.040> about<00:03:36.160> privacy<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:37.120> safety

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
people concern about privacy and safety

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.930 
people concern about privacy and safety
so<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.379> not<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:39.099> company's<00:03:39.519> leading

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
so it's not just the company's leading

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.869 
so it's not just the company's leading
the<00:03:40.030> charge<00:03:40.239> floatees<00:03:41.109> vision<00:03:41.470> is<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.739> fly<00:03:42.010> so

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
the charge floatees vision is to fly so

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.000 
the charge floatees vision is to fly so
anything<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.510> want<00:03:43.720> flown<00:03:44.079> to<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.590> it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
anything that you want flown to you it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.519 
anything that you want flown to you it
will<00:03:45.250> deliver
