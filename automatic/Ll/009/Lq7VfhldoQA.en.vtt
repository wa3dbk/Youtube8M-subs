00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.590 
the pizza sauce it's super sweet
probably<00:04:10.110> too<00:04:10.380> sweet<00:04:10.740> for<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> pizza<00:04:11.400> sauce<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
probably too sweet for a pizza sauce the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.020 
probably too sweet for a pizza sauce the
cheese<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:13.020> top<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.500> full<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.100> garlic<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:14.940> if

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
cheese on top is full of garlic so if

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.000 
cheese on top is full of garlic so if
you<00:04:15.090> guys<00:04:15.240> don't<00:04:15.570> like<00:04:15.810> garlic<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.620> probably

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
you guys don't like garlic you probably

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.550 
you guys don't like garlic you probably
won't<00:04:17.220> like<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.640> cheese<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.560> personally

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
won't like the cheese I personally

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.470 
won't like the cheese I personally
really<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> cheese<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.489> top<00:04:20.700> but<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.329> is

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
really like the cheese on top but it is

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.220 
really like the cheese on top but it is
a<00:04:21.510> bit<00:04:21.870> overpowering<00:04:23.600> overall<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.780> think<00:04:25.110> it's

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
a bit overpowering overall I think it's

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.390 
a bit overpowering overall I think it's
just<00:04:25.500> okay

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
just okay

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.270 
just okay
