00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
 for 200 thousand tenge for bought a small 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.630
 the volume of fabric sewed a small batch and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.700

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.320
 civil act many looking 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.739
 for example, the genres promised her social 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.040
 networks 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.750
 that in their regions will also be engaged 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.180
 similar business from my task 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.459
 What that is, is that even if young people 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.980
 it spreads to the maximum and to 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.799
 someone picked it up we found a good one

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.830
 there the fan made here is not difficult 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.750

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.510
 delighted women met this now 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.480
 try for men to come up with some 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.130
 the same series of patriots say strange 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.349
 don't live in your own country 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.849
 national color all the years 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.970
 independence is the richest culture 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.190
 Eurasia remained in the back 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.990
 imitation of foreign things in 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 the nineties is chinese sports 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.030
 costume in two thousand turkish sheepskin coat 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.910
 By and large, little has changed since 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.140
 of that time I am Kazakh between 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.170
 Lomachenko with 7 2 years from Aktobe itself 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.960
 Here I was born in Russia but I live here 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.390
 all my life and not my country the most and 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.240
 love and of course this is this beauty 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.060
 and I always defended my diploma on exactly 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.040
 our Kazakh clothes are very 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.920
 beautiful clothes just generally delighted 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.070
 exact exactly how Kazakh clothes on 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.230
 beautiful clothes state ideologues 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.870
 independence eras and nur admirers 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.270
 the radiance, wittingly or unwittingly, held up 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.490
 discarded the development of civil initiatives 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.430
 to the place and not to the place whether pyao is ugly 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.739
 soulless personality cult symbols 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.019
 replacing national wealth 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.730
 thoughts make ourselves poor everywhere 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.970
 with clothes 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.460
 there are some of these in the same television 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.540
 we ourselves do the poor as a nation it 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.990
 and as lodgers 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.480
 we live in our house as lodgers 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 everything is not our live on everyones there 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.730
 incomprehensible our traditions no day 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.240
 trace civil society 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.950
 says that their time has passed patriotism in 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.320
 trend people want to be proud 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.880
 national symbols and be yourself 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.880
 master of his country
