in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.040> want<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.280> show<00:00:02.460> you<00:00:02.520> what

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
in this video I want to show you what

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.220 
in this video I want to show you what
the<00:00:02.970> CS<00:00:03.600> source<00:00:03.929> recoil<00:00:04.500> bug<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.990> to<00:00:06.990> see

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the CS source recoil bug is and to see

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.930 
the CS source recoil bug is and to see
it<00:00:07.429> you<00:00:08.429> should<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:11.269> be<00:00:12.269> cheese<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:13.940> post

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
it you should just be cheese one post

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.920 
it you should just be cheese one post
time<00:00:15.480> scale<00:00:15.960> zero<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:17.240> when<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.330> load<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
time scale zero one when you load it

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.400 
time scale zero one when you load it
loaded<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.560> their<00:00:19.770> game<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.600> then<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:22.230> can

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
loaded up their game and then you can

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.400 
loaded up their game and then you can
just<00:00:22.590> shoot<00:00:22.769> your<00:00:22.920> rifle<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.170> what<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> will

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
just shoot your rifle and what you will

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.000 
just shoot your rifle and what you will
see<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.670> recoil<00:00:27.680> which<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
see is that the recoil which is the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.099 
see is that the recoil which is the
movement<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:30.210> screen<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.869> shoot

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
movement of your screen when you shoot

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.350 
movement of your screen when you shoot
you<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.369> screen<00:00:32.910> slowly

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you go up and then the screen slowly

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
you go up and then the screen slowly
comes<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:33.870> down<00:00:34.079> you'll<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
comes back down you'll see that it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
comes back down you'll see that it's
extremely<00:00:35.550> jagged<00:00:36.210> compared<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> moving<00:00:37.110> your

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
extremely jagged compared to moving your

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.600 
extremely jagged compared to moving your
mouse<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> reason<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.340> put

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
mouse and the reason this is is you put

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.470 
mouse and the reason this is is you put
this<00:00:41.760> host<00:00:41.969> timescale<00:00:42.270> 0.1<00:00:43.200> which<00:00:43.500> basically

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
this host timescale 0.1 which basically

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.729 
this host timescale 0.1 which basically
this<00:00:45.480> game<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.200> thinks<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.590> you're

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this game now really thinks that you're

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.209 
this game now really thinks that you're
rendering<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.280> 900<00:00:47.760> frames<00:00:48.000> per<00:00:48.239> second<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
rendering at 900 frames per second and

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
rendering at 900 frames per second and
basically<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.610> seeing<00:00:50.910> every<00:00:51.239> frame<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
basically also seeing every frame so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
basically also seeing every frame so
this<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.699> your

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this is actually what you see on your

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.619 
this is actually what you see on your
monitor<00:00:55.010> except<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> actually<00:00:59.609> happens

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.479 

of<00:01:03.629> course<00:01:03.690> fast<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> don't

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
of course fast like this so you don't

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
of course fast like this so you don't
really<00:01:05.760> notice<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.330> no<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
really notice them no this is actually a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.760 
really notice them no this is actually a
tick<00:01:07.439> 33<00:01:07.950> server<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.320> recoil

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
tick 33 server that this the recoil

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
tick 33 server that this the recoil
movement<00:01:11.460> happens<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.119> each<00:01:12.360> tick<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> an

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
movement happens at each tick so an

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
movement happens at each tick so an
orange<00:01:15.000> box<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.479> happens<00:01:15.840> every<00:01:16.080> 15

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
orange box it happens every 15

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940 
orange box it happens every 15
milliseconds<00:01:17.180> main<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> tick<00:01:18.509> 33<00:01:19.020> server<00:01:19.560> every

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
milliseconds main a tick 33 server every

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.210 
milliseconds main a tick 33 server every
30<00:01:20.220> milliseconds<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> tick<00:01:22.890> hundred

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
30 milliseconds and in a tick hundred

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
30 milliseconds and in a tick hundred
server<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:24.180> used<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> happen<00:01:24.780> every<00:01:24.990> 10

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
server they used to happen every 10

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
server they used to happen every 10
milliseconds<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.549> also<00:01:26.759> an<00:01:27.000> explanation

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
milliseconds this is also an explanation

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.920 
milliseconds this is also an explanation
why<00:01:27.890> people<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.369> CS<00:01:30.180> sorcery<00:01:30.689> quote

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
why people think that CS sorcery quote

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
why people think that CS sorcery quote
became<00:01:31.320> harder<00:01:31.710> when<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:32.040> switched<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> 200

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
became harder when they switched to 200

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
became harder when they switched to 200
because<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.680> 200<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> 266<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.680> all<00:01:37.680> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
because from 200 to 266 because all this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.039 
because from 200 to 266 because all this
people<00:01:38.310> movement<00:01:39.200> all<00:01:40.200> became<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:41.490> jagged

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
people movement all became more jagged

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.190 
people movement all became more jagged
now<00:01:43.189> why<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> call<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.850> bug<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.390> because

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
now why I call this a bug is because

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.359 
now why I call this a bug is because
because<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> something<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.950> I'll<00:01:50.159> show<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because of something that I'll show you

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
because of something that I'll show you
right<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> actually<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.590> old

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
right now so I this is actually an old

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
right now so I this is actually an old
version<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.060> safe<00:01:54.329> source<00:01:54.630> visit<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.350> two

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
version of safe source visit for two

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.980 
version of safe source visit for two
reasons<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.000> take<00:01:57.210> 33<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
reasons one that I can have take 33 so

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
reasons one that I can have take 33 so
you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.909> battery<00:01:59.909> come<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> on

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you can see this battery come up and on

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
you can see this battery come up and on
the<00:02:00.780> video<00:02:00.930> better<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.610> can

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the video better the other is that I can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
the video better the other is that I can
actually<00:02:02.939> use<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> command<00:02:03.659> called<00:02:03.920> CL

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
actually use a command called CL

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually use a command called CL
internally<00:02:06.829> now<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.099> command<00:02:08.429> doesn't

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
internally now this command doesn't

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.809 
internally now this command doesn't
exist<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.270> voice<00:02:09.479> box<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.979> does

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
exist in voice box but does

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.350 
exist in voice box but does
of<00:02:12.510> course<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.379> just<00:02:14.060> completely<00:02:15.060> set

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
of course it's it's just completely set

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.140 
of course it's it's just completely set
on<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.659> just<00:02:15.840> can't<00:02:16.079> turn<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.560> off<00:02:16.650> anymore<00:02:17.150> so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
on you just can't turn it off anymore so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.809 
on you just can't turn it off anymore so
I'll<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.390> switch<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.200> off<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:20.489> reason<00:02:20.760> I

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
I'll just switch that off the reason I

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.330 
I'll just switch that off the reason I
want<00:02:20.969> to<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.680> because<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:23.099> when<00:02:23.310> I

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
want to do that is because now when I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.910 
want to do that is because now when I
move<00:02:23.640> I'll<00:02:24.390> leave<00:02:24.659> on<00:02:24.780> foot<00:02:24.959> post<00:02:25.230> post<00:02:25.620> I'm

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
move I'll leave on foot post post I'm

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.069 
move I'll leave on foot post post I'm
skilled<00:02:26.250> back<00:02:26.430> well<00:02:26.640> again<00:02:26.879> now<00:02:27.629> when<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.810> move

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
skilled back well again now when I move

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.360 
skilled back well again now when I move
you'll<00:02:28.319> notice<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.859> sort<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.159> jagged

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you'll notice this sort of jagged

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.289 
you'll notice this sort of jagged
movement<00:02:30.920> now<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.159> jagged<00:02:32.700> movement<00:02:33.120> is

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
movement now this jagged movement is

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.849 
movement now this jagged movement is
exactly<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> same<00:02:34.049> jagged<00:02:34.409> movement<00:02:34.739> that

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
exactly the same jagged movement that

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.990 
exactly the same jagged movement that
was<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.720> recoil<00:02:36.980> what<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.280> actually<00:02:38.579> is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
was on recoil what this is actually is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.059 
was on recoil what this is actually is
the<00:02:39.900> game<00:02:40.079> actually<00:02:40.470> calculates<00:02:40.950> your

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
the game actually calculates your

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.270 
the game actually calculates your
position<00:02:41.639> always<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.870> these<00:02:43.170> tick<00:02:43.500> frames<00:02:43.799> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
position always on these tick frames so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.240 
position always on these tick frames so
on<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.849> click<00:02:45.269> 33<00:02:45.750> server<00:02:46.019> basically<00:02:46.290> 33<00:02:47.099> times

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
on a click 33 server basically 33 times

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.770 
on a click 33 server basically 33 times
a<00:02:47.489> second<00:02:47.819> or<00:02:47.909> actually<00:02:48.239> every<00:02:48.450> 30

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
a second or actually every 30

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.690 
a second or actually every 30
milliseconds<00:02:49.700> okay<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:52.069> what<00:02:53.069> interpolate

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
milliseconds okay and what interpolate

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.449 
milliseconds okay and what interpolate
does<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:57.120> smoothes<00:02:57.419> your<00:02:57.689> movement

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
does is it smoothes your movement

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.940 
does is it smoothes your movement
between<00:02:59.459> those<00:02:59.879> positions<00:03:00.659> if<00:03:01.319> your<00:03:01.560> computer

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
between those positions if your computer

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.309 
between those positions if your computer
is<00:03:02.010> constantly<00:03:02.760> predicting<00:03:03.389> where<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.169> will

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
is constantly predicting where you will

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.110 
is constantly predicting where you will
be<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.799> one<00:03:05.790> takes<00:03:06.090> time<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:07.609> therefore<00:03:08.609> you

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
be in one takes time and therefore you

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.929 
be in one takes time and therefore you
it<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.750> also<00:03:09.930> enter<00:03:10.260> play<00:03:10.560> your<00:03:10.739> position

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
it can also enter play your position

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.280 
it can also enter play your position
between<00:03:11.939> those<00:03:12.120> points<00:03:12.840> when<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:13.260> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
between those points when you have a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.319 
between those points when you have a
higher<00:03:13.530> ethicist<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.700> great<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.060> I

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
higher ethicist and what a great is I

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.439 
higher ethicist and what a great is I
don't<00:03:16.199> see<00:03:16.409> any<00:03:16.680> reason<00:03:17.099> why<00:03:17.129> recoil<00:03:18.120> couldn't

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
don't see any reason why recoil couldn't

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.860 
don't see any reason why recoil couldn't
be<00:03:18.540> interpolated<00:03:18.959> as<00:03:19.319> well<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.739> well<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
be interpolated as well as well so in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.099 
be interpolated as well as well so in
that<00:03:21.959> sense<00:03:23.000> there's<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.090> bug<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.359> CS<00:03:24.810> source

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
that sense there's a bug in CS source

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.140 
that sense there's a bug in CS source
and<00:03:25.379> why<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.280> think<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.729> is<00:03:26.849> sort<00:03:27.030> of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and why I think this is sort of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.789 
and why I think this is sort of
important<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.229> now<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.680> they're

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
important is that now that they're

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.640 
important is that now that they're
testing<00:03:29.220> global<00:03:29.549> operations<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.560> my

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
testing global operations to my

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.469 
testing global operations to my
understanding<00:03:32.220> global<00:03:32.310> operations<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.209> based

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
understanding global operations is based

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.949 
understanding global operations is based
on<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> CS<00:03:34.139> source<00:03:34.379> engine<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.959> really

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
on the CS source engine so I really

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.629 
on the CS source engine so I really
really<00:03:37.199> hope<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:37.560> they<00:03:37.739> fix<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.220> bug<00:03:38.459> in

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
really hope that they fix this bug in

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.580 
really hope that they fix this bug in
global<00:03:39.120> operations<00:03:39.659> because<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.229> don't<00:03:40.409> really

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
global operations because I don't really

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.339 
global operations because I don't really
think<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:41.099> they<00:03:41.909> can<00:03:42.090> manage<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.109> make<00:03:43.229> the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
think that they can manage to make the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.349 
think that they can manage to make the
game<00:03:43.500> good<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.159> bug<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.639> mean<00:03:45.169> in<00:03:46.169> CS<00:03:46.440> 1.6

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
game good with this bug I mean in CS 1.6

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.949 
game good with this bug I mean in CS 1.6
you<00:03:48.359> don't<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.810> problem<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.620> CS<00:03:49.859> 1.6

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
you don't have this problem in CS 1.6

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.149 
you don't have this problem in CS 1.6
everything<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.079> smooth<00:03:52.319> because<00:03:52.709> every<00:03:52.949> tick

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
everything is smooth because every tick

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.429 
everything is smooth because every tick
is<00:03:53.760> also<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.949> mean<00:03:55.949> in<00:03:56.430> CS<00:03:56.699> 1.6<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.900> FPS<00:03:58.260> is

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
is also I mean in CS 1.6 the FPS is

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.899 
is also I mean in CS 1.6 the FPS is
capped<00:03:58.680> at<00:03:58.859> a<00:03:58.919> hundred<00:03:59.129> which<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.459> also<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
capped at a hundred which is also the

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.420 
capped at a hundred which is also the
tick<00:04:00.180> rate<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.599> game<00:04:00.750> basically<00:04:01.169> so<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:02.220> CS

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
tick rate of the game basically so in CS

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.219 
tick rate of the game basically so in CS
1.6<00:04:02.609> um<00:04:03.269> perfectly<00:04:03.930> smooth<00:04:04.199> recoil<00:04:04.739> and

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
1.6 um perfectly smooth recoil and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.420 
1.6 um perfectly smooth recoil and
that's<00:04:07.229> what<00:04:07.439> they<00:04:07.590> should<00:04:07.620> also<00:04:07.889> make<00:04:08.220> for

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
that's what they should also make for

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.299 
that's what they should also make for
global<00:04:08.790> operations
