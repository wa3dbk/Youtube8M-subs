one<00:03:14.080> method<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.530> aiming<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.190> add<00:03:15.340> before

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
one method of aiming that we add before

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.330 
one method of aiming that we add before
implementing<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.709> aiming<00:03:18.010> into<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
implementing the the aiming into the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.250 
implementing the the aiming into the
zero<00:03:18.610> arm<00:03:18.849> is<00:03:19.120> using<00:03:19.390> track<00:03:19.599> by<00:03:19.750> hours<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.170> we

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
zero arm is using track by hours so we

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.589 
zero arm is using track by hours so we
have<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.530> track<00:03:20.739> by<00:03:20.920> our<00:03:21.069> camera<00:03:21.599> mounted

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
have the track by our camera mounted

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.440 
have the track by our camera mounted
here<00:03:22.959> on<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.709> shoulder<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.790> looks<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.269> have

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
here on the shoulder and it looks I have

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.420 
here on the shoulder and it looks I have
three<00:03:25.780> marker<00:03:26.200> dots<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.769> red<00:03:26.980> dot<00:03:27.190> sight

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
three marker dots on this red dot sight

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.970 
three marker dots on this red dot sight
right<00:03:27.610> here<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.720> game<00:03:28.900> can<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.830> can

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
right here so in the game can you can

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.850 
right here so in the game can you can
aim<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.459> with<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.450> marker<00:03:31.810> instead<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
aim with with the marker instead of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.229 
aim with with the marker instead of
using<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.160> track<00:03:33.340> bar<00:03:33.489> though<00:03:33.819> what<00:03:34.150> I'm

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
using the track bar though what I'm

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.040 
using the track bar though what I'm
going<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.420> do<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.630> I'm<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.900> disconnect

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
going to do is I'm going to disconnect

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.440 
going to do is I'm going to disconnect
this<00:03:35.440> I'll<00:03:35.709> show<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.580> using<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> zero<00:03:37.300> arm

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
this I'll show just using the zero arm

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.070 
this I'll show just using the zero arm
itself<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.670> case<00:03:39.940> we<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.630> bring<00:03:40.900> up

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
itself and in this case we can bring up

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.880 
itself and in this case we can bring up
our<00:03:41.349> arm<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.160> when<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.910> bring<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.239> our<00:03:43.330> arm

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
our arm and when we bring up our arm

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.680 
our arm and when we bring up our arm
then<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.190> we<00:03:45.849> got<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> really<00:03:46.330> really

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
then we have we got a really really

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.110 
then we have we got a really really
precise<00:03:47.349> aiming<00:03:47.650> built<00:03:48.340> into<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.670> arm<00:03:48.849> itself

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
precise aiming built into the arm itself

another<00:04:11.460> thing<00:04:11.610> we<00:04:11.700> can<00:04:11.819> do<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.480> can

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
another thing we can do is you can

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.789 
another thing we can do is you can
navigate<00:04:12.810> directly<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
navigate directly with the with the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
navigate directly with the with the
system<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:18.120> right<00:04:18.329> here<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.570> an

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
system so this right here is an

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.569 
system so this right here is an
accelerometer<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.799> we<00:04:19.890> can<00:04:20.010> use<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.310> detect

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
accelerometer that we can use to detect

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.420 
accelerometer that we can use to detect
walking<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.690> finally<00:04:22.049> if<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:22.530> walk<00:04:22.770> with

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
walking so finally if I just walk with

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.170 
walking so finally if I just walk with
my<00:04:23.580> legs

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
my legs

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.500 
my legs
it'll<00:04:24.900> have<00:04:25.050> me<00:04:25.170> walk<00:04:25.410> through<00:04:26.419> through<00:04:27.419> the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
it'll have me walk through through the

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.480 
it'll have me walk through through the
seeing<00:04:27.930> if<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.110> want<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.350> run<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.770> can<00:04:28.980> just<00:04:29.250> start

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
seeing if I want to run I can just start

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.750 
seeing if I want to run I can just start
running<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:31.110> as<00:04:31.380> I'm<00:04:31.650> running<00:04:32.160> the

another thing you can do with the CEO
arm<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.490> you<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:54.960> trigger<00:04:56.040> movement<00:04:57.040> so<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:57.280> we

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
arm is you can trigger movement so if we

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.070 
arm is you can trigger movement so if we
wanted<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.670> do<00:04:57.790> a<00:04:57.820> melee<00:04:58.150> knife<00:04:58.450> attack<00:04:58.810> for

like<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.780> side<00:05:05.590> pitch<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:09.910> can<00:05:10.090> shoot<00:05:10.300> we<00:05:10.420> can

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
like a side pitch so we can shoot we can

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.300 
like a side pitch so we can shoot we can
trigger<00:05:10.750> other<00:05:10.960> events<00:05:11.440> too<00:05:11.620> if<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:11.860> wanted<00:05:12.250> to

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
trigger other events too if we wanted to

get around I can scope in shoot with the

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.759 
get around I can scope in shoot with the
trigger

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:10.769 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.070 

this<00:06:11.769> is<00:06:11.919> the<00:06:12.009> m9<00:06:12.429> pistol<00:06:12.939> prototype<00:06:13.419> it<00:06:13.719> has<00:06:14.049> a

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
this is the m9 pistol prototype it has a

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.379 
this is the m9 pistol prototype it has a
mouse<00:06:14.860> functionality<00:06:15.669> built<00:06:15.819> into<00:06:16.239> it<00:06:16.360> so

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
mouse functionality built into it so

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.179 
mouse functionality built into it so
it's<00:06:16.629> got<00:06:16.749> left<00:06:17.049> right<00:06:17.169> middle<00:06:17.499> mouse<00:06:17.799> and

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
it's got left right middle mouse and

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:27.570 
it's got left right middle mouse and
scroll<00:06:18.639> wheel<00:06:18.849> and<00:06:19.379> game<00:06:20.379> we<00:06:20.649> can<00:06:20.799> just

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.300 

so<00:06:28.390> this<00:06:28.570> is<00:06:28.690> the<00:06:28.810> zo<00:06:29.080> combat<00:06:29.620> knife<00:06:29.800> prototype

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
so this is the zo combat knife prototype

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.160 
so this is the zo combat knife prototype
it's<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.700> rubber<00:06:30.940> training<00:06:31.420> knife<00:06:31.600> they<00:06:31.930> can<00:06:32.080> be

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
it's a rubber training knife they can be

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.170 
it's a rubber training knife they can be
snapped<00:06:32.440> directly<00:06:32.950> under<00:06:33.160> the<00:06:33.280> zo<00:06:33.520> arm<00:06:33.820> for

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
snapped directly under the zo arm for

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.530 
snapped directly under the zo arm for
for<00:06:34.600> training<00:06:34.900> purposes<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:36.210> right<00:06:37.210> now<00:06:37.360> it

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
for training purposes and right now it

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.570 
for training purposes and right now it
has<00:06:37.690> a<00:06:37.720> quick<00:06:37.990> connector<00:06:38.410> at<00:06:38.710> the<00:06:38.890> base<00:06:39.280> we

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
has a quick connector at the base we

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.100 
has a quick connector at the base we
could<00:06:39.700> also<00:06:39.850> put<00:06:40.150> one<00:06:40.180> on<00:06:40.390> the<00:06:40.480> hilt<00:06:40.750> if<00:06:40.990> we

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
could also put one on the hilt if we

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.070 
could also put one on the hilt if we
wanted<00:06:41.380> to<00:06:41.440> do<00:06:41.710> combat<00:06:42.550> knife<00:06:42.970> training<00:06:43.480> we

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
wanted to do combat knife training we

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.690 
wanted to do combat knife training we
could<00:06:44.230> also<00:06:44.350> remove<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:45.040> quick<00:06:45.280> connector

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
could also remove the quick connector

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.660 
could also remove the quick connector
completely<00:06:46.540> if<00:06:46.840> we<00:06:47.020> wanted<00:06:47.440> to<00:06:47.530> have<00:06:47.740> more

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
completely if we wanted to have more
