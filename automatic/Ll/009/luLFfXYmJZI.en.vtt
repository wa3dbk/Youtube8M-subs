00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
bottom three coils are on so you can

bottom three coils are on so you can
have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.000> number<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:14.360> combinations<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.690> think

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
have a number of combinations I think

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
have a number of combinations I think
it's<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.590> practical<00:01:17.160> in<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.520> studio<00:01:17.910> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's only practical in the studio I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.640 
it's only practical in the studio I
don't<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.510> how<00:01:18.630> you'd<00:01:18.780> manage<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.320> stage

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
don't know how you'd manage it on stage

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
don't know how you'd manage it on stage
but<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:20.760> are<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> couple<00:01:21.210> settings<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.840> found

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
but there are a couple settings I found

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.690 
but there are a couple settings I found
out<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.500> I'll<00:01:22.710> run<00:01:22.920> those<00:01:23.100> through<00:01:23.130> those

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
out like I'll run those through those

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.320 
out like I'll run those through those
and<00:01:24.799> I'm<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> run<00:01:26.159> through<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> with

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and I'm going to run through this with

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.080 
and I'm going to run through this with
the<00:01:27.420> pickup<00:01:27.689> centered<00:01:28.340> get<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:29.430> idea<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> tone

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the pickup centered get an idea the tone

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:53.860 
the pickup centered get an idea the tone
with<00:01:30.330> just<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.630> different<00:01:30.960> pickup<00:01:31.320> starting

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:03:32.620 

it'll<00:01:54.870> pick<00:01:55.050> up<00:01:55.230> by<00:01:55.410> itself

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:04:13.259 

top<00:03:33.630> two<00:03:33.870> pickups<00:03:34.320> together

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.580 

here's<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.330> combination<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.959> thought<00:04:15.200> was<00:04:15.349> good

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
here's a combination I thought was good

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.050 
here's a combination I thought was good
