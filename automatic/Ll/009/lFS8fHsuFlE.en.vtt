00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 It's a schedule

 Hmm 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:01.520

 The most sluggish 8k 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.230
 Well, I'm relaxed and I accept it 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.900
 The stride is too big and it feels like the usual atmosphere 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.570
 Second Shonan Mighty + 4 k 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:29.950
 So to the Yes Well the last time I twice 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:34.930
 I was worried about the pine family, but I hit that one and the liveliness came back for a while. 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.790
 There is an impression that the tension of the body is a little more good than when it was a little good 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 But I think I'll hit it and go up 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.690
 No. 3 Tokai Paradise + 2 k 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.640
 Spirit 8 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 It is an impression that it is hidden in the inside very high 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.950
 One way of walking is very soft that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 I also think that certainly picking up better here 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.570
 No. 4 Epifa year and five months and a half after the holidays 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.000

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.289
 Very Hey 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.790

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.800
 Well it Shinobu 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:21.520
 It is very strong from the coach, and I 'm going to rub it down 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:28.480
 I think the outline of the body is effective I think one finish is better 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:34.720
 Minus is 8 km No. 5 Mei show Mambo 5 months of rest dawn Yes Well here was also thick 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:39.170
 Very course horse body is to no chair You have to show a clean high as that after the holidays 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.680
 It is put out likely atmosphere or also have to relax the force 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.459

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 U 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.140
 The high numbers themselves have dropped considerably 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.270
 There is no impression that it became thin 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.480
 I think that it is always soft and there is softness in that resort and it is not bad as a finish 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.080
 I will 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.480

 The weight of this horse is 498 kg 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.750
 Here 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.230
 There is also a factory sound even if you fold one 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.540
 You You have very even riding a yell as high Yasui and houses 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.810
 Something even tension of your test 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.870
 There is an impression that has improved considerably than before 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.989
 I think that the demon is growing 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.660
 End 8th Karen Milotic 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.680
 +4 k 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.670
 Let's go on a very strong horse 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.849
 I think there is some room around my stomach 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.730
 It It is a very strong will put from here go 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:47.930
