00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.340
 Hello everyone, sing up from school and you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 I am Sergey Cherkasov 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 exercise and solo from the book sing a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.430
 fashion can and should play rudiments 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.560
 constant drum tuning 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.640
 rudiments is the basis of development 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.010
 technology 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 These exercises allow you to train 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.769
 muscle memory and achieve accuracy 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 transmission rhythmic structure 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.279
 the number of rudiments over the years 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.850
 getting bigger and bigger but we 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.969
 dwell on the main singles of two 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 paradles ephraim and our task is to learn 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 play rudiments musically in general 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.230
 the main task of the drummer to play 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.370
 musically not just peck but play 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 music and so we start with singles 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 strokes on pages 34 to 30 seventh 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.890
 textbook sing a fashion you will find 48 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 exercises each 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 represents a word or phrase in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.979
 The basis of each phrase are the so-called 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 tops of accents further from 38 to 45 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.939
 the page 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.930
 you will find 8 salad is a mix of 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.670
 the previous 48 exercises let's 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.970
 consider exercise number one on 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.759
 page 34 it will be the basis 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 of our today's lesson we need pro 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 clap our phrase in order 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.580
 to hear and remember for this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.950
 we need a metronome 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:46.380
 at pace 70 you need to clap our hands 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:59.990
 phrase and drink it on the syllable ta ta ta ta 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:59.990
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 now when we heard our phrase and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.990
 remember and let's start playing it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.890
 rudimentary single strokes at the base 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.700
 our phrases 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:27.090
 are the eighth notes so they play we 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:29.640
 let's be the eighth note and now let's 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:50.040
 Let's try to place accents from our 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 I want to immediately put phrases 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480
 the groove in our understanding will not 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.120
 temporary sensation of real ripple 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.080
 and the rhythm that we will create when 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.570
 using phrases from the book sing a fashion 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.270
 and since I already said the basis of our 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.120
 lesson will be exercise number one for 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.640
 example take the simplest ostinato head 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:25.910
 plays 8th and second quarter 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:30.250
 playing snare now we will 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.250
 play our phrase on bass drum have 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.130
 one more rule when creating a groove if 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.220
 bass drum matches snare drum 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.950
 on the second or fourth share in our 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.470
 case on the fourth then this note on bass 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.390
 the drum we exclude so we 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.390
 make room for snare drum 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.490
 we go further now we are from our 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.940
 exercises will create a fill 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.390
 there is a small groove here 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:38.140
 eighth notes are played on the bass drum 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:40.210
 quarters are played on snare all 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:56.620
 our strength will need to be played twice 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:58.630
 quicker go to creating fila here 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.480
 same rule as previous 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:16.510
 Exercise 8 is the snare drum 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:20.130
 quarters is alt and tab let's 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.130
 try to play it faster 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.580
 so friends with one exercise 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.099
 we learned how to create groove 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.870
 filling the groove and fil let's 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.259
 let's hear how it will sound with 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.259
 music 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:32.559
 that's all if you liked the lesson 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.449
 Like to make a repost for those who 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.279
 wants to work out with me i'm waiting for you on 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:38.139
 their individual lessons in 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:40.509
 rehearsal complex 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.089
 why complex yes because here and 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.080
