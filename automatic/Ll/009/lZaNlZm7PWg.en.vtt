00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
mock of Stalingrad I started with just

mock of Stalingrad I started with just
this<00:00:14.639> building<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.299> built<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.590> fun

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800

this building I built that just for fun
I<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:17.130> some<00:00:17.340> directions<00:00:18.029> from<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.420> website

that I did and then I just formed it in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.650 
that I did and then I just formed it in
to<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:22.500> snowy<00:00:23.010> terrain<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.390> some

to just snowy terrain with just some
other<00:00:24.779> broken<00:00:25.230> buildings<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.480> just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
other broken buildings it was just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300 
other broken buildings it was just
really<00:00:28.080> fun<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> make<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.220> was

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
really fun to make that one that was

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
really fun to make that one that was
probably<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.080> most<00:00:31.260> proud

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

kind of have the roofs up a lot of these

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
kind of have the roofs up a lot of these
buildings<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.969> they've<00:00:39.149> been<00:00:39.180> blowing

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
buildings like they've been blowing

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.090 
buildings like they've been blowing
apart<00:00:39.899> you've<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.649> details<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.040> the

apart you've got some details in the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.340 
apart you've got some details in the
buildings<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.610> too<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.000> yeah<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
buildings there too right yeah in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
buildings there too right yeah in the
back<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> flip<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> one

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
back of here if we can flip this one

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.619 
back of here if we can flip this one
around<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:46.850> get<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> second<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.480> real

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
around here get a second here real

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.650 
around here get a second here real
quickie<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:49.469> looks<00:00:49.530> like

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.560 

there<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.410> go

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
there you go

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
there you go
and<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.320> back<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.310> generator

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and that back there that's a generator

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
and that back there that's a generator
and<00:00:59.970> everything<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.290> I'm<00:01:01.560> really<00:01:01.800> happy

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and everything I just I'm really happy

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.939 
and everything I just I'm really happy
how<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.160> turned<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.650> you've<00:01:04.800> got

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
how it turned out and then you've got

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.260 
how it turned out and then you've got
obviously<00:01:05.100> they're<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.730> fighting<00:01:06.000> from

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
obviously they're kind of fighting from

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.610 
obviously they're kind of fighting from
the<00:01:06.300> broken<00:01:06.750> windows<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.050> things<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
the broken windows and things are the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.880 
the broken windows and things are the
vehicles<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.750> custom-made<00:01:09.750> no<00:01:10.680> they

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
vehicles and this custom-made no they

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
just fun was that two base plates and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.730 
just fun was that two base plates and
then<00:01:18.840> you're<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> built<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> snow

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
then you're just kind of built the snow

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
then you're just kind of built the snow
just<00:01:20.070> two<00:01:20.280> base<00:01:20.490> plates<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
just two base plates and then just just

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.550 
just two base plates and then just just
a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.410> other<00:01:22.530> smaller<00:01:23.040> flat<00:01:23.490> parts<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
a lot of other smaller flat parts is it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.680 
a lot of other smaller flat parts is it
do<00:01:25.800> you<00:01:25.860> build<00:01:26.070> mostly<00:01:26.490> historical<00:01:26.760> builds

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
do you build mostly historical builds

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.180 
do you build mostly historical builds
then<00:01:27.870> mostly<00:01:28.260> like<00:01:28.410> World<00:01:28.620> War<00:01:28.740> two<00:01:28.920> type

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
then mostly like World War two type

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.130 
then mostly like World War two type
fields<00:01:29.520> yeah<00:01:29.910> I<00:01:29.940> built<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.420> d-day<00:01:30.750> build<00:01:30.990> before

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
fields yeah I built a d-day build before

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
fields yeah I built a d-day build before
and<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.740> probably<00:01:31.920> uh<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.360> my

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and that was probably uh that was my

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.930 
and that was probably uh that was my
best<00:01:33.660> one<00:01:33.840> I've<00:01:34.020> done<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:35.009> d-day<00:01:35.310> build<00:01:35.550> but

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
best one I've done that d-day build but

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.700 
best one I've done that d-day build but
I<00:01:35.970> took<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> apart<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.780> parts<00:01:37.050> when<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I took that apart for parts when you're

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
I took that apart for parts when you're
building<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.220> types<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> builds<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.119> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
building these types of builds are you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
building these types of builds are you
looking<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.600> historical<00:01:40.170> photos<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
looking at historical photos and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.260 
looking at historical photos and
drawings<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.610> sort<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.180> where

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
drawings and that sort of thing or where

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.460 
drawings and that sort of thing or where
do<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> inspiration<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
do you get the inspiration from some of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.969 
do you get the inspiration from some of
these<00:01:43.530> problems

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
these problems

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
these problems
I<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.550> freehand<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I just freehand it I just go at it I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
I just freehand it I just go at it I
just<00:01:46.670> see<00:01:47.670> something<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> my<00:01:48.119> mind<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.600> just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
just see something to my mind and I just
