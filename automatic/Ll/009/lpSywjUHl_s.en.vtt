00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.559
 a bacterium is a being 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.120
 unicellular autonomic bacteria 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.340
 replica from generation to generation of 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.780
 identical way except in certain cases 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.870
 where they can lose their equipment 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.129
 genetic or acquire 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.080
 there are bacteria that are part of 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.480
 what is called the normal flora of 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.850
 the human body it's the bacteria 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.829
 who are in the digestive tract who are 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.360
 especially at the level of the skin and these 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.620
 Bacteria is a funny barrier effect 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.690
 that is, it avoids 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.210
 bacteria responsible for infections 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.520
 implant the most common ones on 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.649
 skin infections infections 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.750
 Bone cutaneous pulmonary infection 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.200
 loved them the impulses of 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.200
 management 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.440
 go on to bacterial infections there are 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.420
 two strategies 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.020
 there is vaccination is the type of 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.880
 therapy vaccination A whole 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.740
 small number of bacteria so the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.479
 second but strategic and develop 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.750
 it is to destroy these bacteria by 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.750
 antibiotics 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.580
 there is always a small number of 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.869
 bacteria that are resistant to our 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 small even when he's totally 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.410
 new and these resistant bacteria have 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.119
 have been selected by the important use 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.300
 and massive of these antibiotics in the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.300
 world 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.380
 for now the resistances concerns 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 much more bacteria to whores to 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.649
 say that the so - called city bacteria this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.020
 are bacteria that we can 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.750
 acquire at the hospital or who are 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.550
 present in the individual and when he 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 is hospitalized and because of his team 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.260
 another depression she is there 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.550
 develop 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.870
 the development of these bacteria 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.390
 resistant especially in medium 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.920
 hospital jeopardize everything 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.350
 a pan of modern medicine 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.160
 major surgery the resuscitation 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.170
 transplants 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.459
 we may fear that if she does not 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.270
 development of your antibiotics 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.780
 there is particular medicine that does not 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.780
 will do more 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.980
 it is certain that the prospects for 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360
 development at three to five years or ten 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.610
 years of new other little ones are enough 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.770
 limited why because the 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.170
 investments were little done the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.280
 domain for several reasons the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.860
 profitability of this research can 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.110
 appear limited to the industrial fact 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.750
 five to ten years of developing a 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.270
 new molecule when it is suffered 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.930
 on the market two three obstacles the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.400
 first 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.930
 what is the state of resistance to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 antibiotics that have evolved in ten years 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.920
 is the molecule on which he has 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.310
 worked and Egypt and already not 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.090
 inactive secondly is that the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.860
 medical world is not going to limit so 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.790
 drastic use this new 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.290
 molecule and therefore prevent the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.880
 the important use of this 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.680
 antibiotic and for the industrialist 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.030
 to have a return on investment and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.980
 then finally there is one thing very 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.560
 important it is not because we 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.090
 decides to work on resistance 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.820
 out of the little control of new 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.230
 antibiotics any idea currently 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.660
 is still in the middle 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 hospital to avoid the spread of 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.370
 these multi-resistant bacteria for 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.850
 save time while waiting for 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.530
 new antibiotics on the market 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.050
 and as a doctor there our first 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.760
 roles it's when a patient is 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.280
 hospitalized to prevent him from 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.060
 contaminate with the resistant bacterium 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.060
 from his neighbor 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.560
 prevention messages resistance 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.879
 with antibiotics it is the following 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.169
 firstly we wash our hands 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.770
 wash your hands wash your hands 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.389
 wash your hands first message 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.490
 second message we use the 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.509
 antibiotics wisely on 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.220
 medical prescription 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.960
 and when we offer you five days of 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.509
 treatment even if we go better or 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.979
 third day we continue until the 5th 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.000
 day to avoid the selection of 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.009
 resistant bacteria 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.129
 these are the two key elements of this 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.129
 case
