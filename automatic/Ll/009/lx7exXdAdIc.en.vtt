zinc right when your engine needs it the

zinc right when your engine needs it the
most<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:29.400> about<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> cinderblock<00:02:30.180> wall<00:02:30.510> how

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
most think about a cinderblock wall how

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.660 
most think about a cinderblock wall how
much<00:02:31.350> paint<00:02:31.620> does<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> first

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
much paint does it take to get the first

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.720 
much paint does it take to get the first
coat<00:02:32.910> established<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.630> lot<00:02:34.070> same<00:02:35.070> thing<00:02:35.400> inside

coat established a lot same thing inside

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.000

your<00:02:35.970> engine<00:02:36.120> every<00:02:36.870> moving<00:02:37.410> metal<00:02:37.620> piece

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
your engine every moving metal piece

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.700 
your engine every moving metal piece
needs<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.000> protective<00:02:39.690> zinc<00:02:40.020> film

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
needs that protective zinc film

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.460 
needs that protective zinc film
so<00:02:41.370> during<00:02:41.610> break-in<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.660> need<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.110> higher

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so during break-in you need a higher

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.520 
so during break-in you need a higher
zinc<00:02:44.010> content<00:02:44.340> oil<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.270> establish<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.110> film

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
zinc content oil to establish that film

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
zinc content oil to establish that film
once<00:02:47.370> you've<00:02:47.520> established<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:48.240> film<00:02:48.540> your

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
once you've established that film your

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.810 
once you've established that film your
regular<00:02:49.290> oil<00:02:49.320> just<00:02:49.710> needs<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> maintain<00:02:50.160> that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
regular oil just needs to maintain that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.270 
regular oil just needs to maintain that
film<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.110> putting<00:02:52.380> down<00:02:52.470> primer

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
film it's just like putting down primer

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.730 
film it's just like putting down primer
before<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:54.090> put<00:02:54.300> down<00:02:54.450> base<00:02:54.780> color<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.260> clear

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.090 
before you put down base color and clear
coat<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.820> how<00:02:56.910> much<00:02:57.060> zinc<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.690> need<00:02:58.100> let's
