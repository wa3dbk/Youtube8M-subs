the<00:01:59.290> difference<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.920> felt<00:02:00.280> was<00:02:00.490> was<00:02:00.940> was

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
the difference that I felt was was was

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.040 
the difference that I felt was was was
why<00:02:02.320> why<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:04.060> know<00:02:04.180> going<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.660> impress

why why is it you know going to impress
me<00:02:05.229> more<00:02:05.440> how<00:02:05.710> does<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> impress<00:02:06.460> me<00:02:06.670> more<00:02:06.880> than

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
me more how does it impress me more than

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.570 
me more how does it impress me more than
the<00:02:07.360> Z<00:02:07.570> did<00:02:07.840> well<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.050> can<00:02:08.260> tell<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:09.250> soon<00:02:09.460> as

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the Z did well I can tell you as soon as

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.130 
the Z did well I can tell you as soon as
you<00:02:09.729> get<00:02:09.880> into<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.179> cockpit<00:02:10.450> when<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.020> get

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you get into this cockpit when you get

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.320 
you get into this cockpit when you get
into<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:11.440> car<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.550> stance<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
into this car just the stance and the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.510 
into this car just the stance and the
feel<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.190> makes<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.459> feel

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
feel of it is it really makes you feel

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.490 
feel of it is it really makes you feel
like<00:02:15.700> you're<00:02:15.940> part<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.420> car<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
like you're part of the car and the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.640 
like you're part of the car and the
performance<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:19.110> really<00:02:20.110> impressive

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
performance of it is really impressive

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.070 
performance of it is really impressive
because<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.850> thing<00:02:22.090> shifts<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.720> paddle

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
because this thing shifts the paddle

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.190 
because this thing shifts the paddle
shift<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.890> fly<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.600> there<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
shift on the fly and there is the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
shift on the fly and there is the
braking<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.800> tremendous<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.880> doesn't

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
braking is tremendous and this doesn't

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.820 
braking is tremendous and this doesn't
even<00:02:31.240> have<00:02:31.420> an<00:02:31.630> upgraded<00:02:31.990> brake<00:02:32.260> system<00:02:32.680> I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
even have an upgraded brake system I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.900 
even have an upgraded brake system I
mean<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.220> standard<00:02:33.760> right

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
mean this is standard right

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.420 
mean this is standard right
off-the-shelf<00:02:34.420> braking<00:02:34.840> system<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:36.160> is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
off-the-shelf braking system and it is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.630 
off-the-shelf braking system and it is
it<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.180> good<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.260> car<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.860> said<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.370> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
it is good the car as I said really it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.729 
it is good the car as I said really it
just<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.330> wraps<00:02:40.600> around<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.500> feel

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
just it wraps around you and you feel

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.080 
just it wraps around you and you feel
like<00:02:41.980> you're<00:02:42.190> part<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.610> car<00:02:42.820> it's<00:02:43.000> got

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
like you're part of the car it's got

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.960 
like you're part of the car it's got
very<00:02:43.360> bold<00:02:43.750> lines<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:45.220> wheel<00:02:45.430> wells<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
very bold lines the the wheel wells the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.900 
very bold lines the the wheel wells the
fender<00:02:46.300> wells<00:02:46.510> are<00:02:46.780> very<00:02:47.350> exaggerated<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
fender wells are very exaggerated so you

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.260 
fender wells are very exaggerated so you
really<00:02:49.360> feel

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.300 

partner<00:02:52.930> Holkar<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> can't<00:02:53.680> say<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.070> enough

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
partner Holkar I can't say that enough

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.510 
partner Holkar I can't say that enough
the<00:02:54.820> stance<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.450> car<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:56.140> low<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
the stance of the car is very low so the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.660 
the stance of the car is very low so the
the<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.360> handling<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.110> just<00:02:59.170> tremendous<00:03:00.130> it's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the the handling is just tremendous it's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.800 
the the handling is just tremendous it's
not<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.180> tight<00:03:01.570> as<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.950> 370<00:03:03.940> was<00:03:04.120> but

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
not as tight as the as the 370 was but

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.630 
not as tight as the as the 370 was but
I've<00:03:04.960> almost<00:03:05.140> come<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.620> enjoy<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> little

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
little bit of time getting used to it

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.140
