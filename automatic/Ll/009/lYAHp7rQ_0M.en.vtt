actually three different things you can

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
actually three different things you can
build<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> shows<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:56.160> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
different sets you can build you make a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.990 
different sets you can build you make a
look<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.129> different<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.640> i<00:01:02.730> thought<00:01:02.879> was

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
look a lot different which i thought was

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
built in one mode anyway and what I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.380 
built in one mode anyway and what I
thought<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> crazy<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.119> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

first<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.670> here's<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.299> built

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
first off here's the one we built

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.469

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
Legos I'm so you could build just kind

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.520 
Legos I'm so you could build just kind
of<00:01:55.189> set<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.310> wanted<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.229> cool

of set you wanted to but just very cool
little<00:01:58.740> set<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.939> said<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
little set like I said there's like a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.190 
little set like I said there's like a
lot<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> pieces<00:02:01.399> 507<00:02:02.399> pieces<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.509> this

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
lot of pieces 507 pieces on this

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.950 
lot of pieces 507 pieces on this
particular<00:02:04.700> version<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.600> build<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
particular version of it you can build a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.390
