00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.300
 Aurora group of companies will tell you how 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.070
 prepare to cultivators tillers 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.049
 first let as we were convinced 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 garden equipment buyers 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.220
 Aurora comes to the plant practically in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.100
 assembled owner 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 it remains to fasten the control knobs 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.510
 assemble the wheels and screw into place 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.699
 wings when the car is assembled remains 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.849
 fuel up cultivators and oil 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.040
 after which you can start the engine but 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 First, let's talk more about 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.170
 oil lubrication in aurora 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 refuels in two separate units for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 engine lubrication and transmissions or 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 gearbox for garden equipment engines 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.440
 Aurora manufacturer recommends 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 use mineral oil for 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 four-stroke engines pour oil into 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 crankcase and follows before grease appears 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 filler cap 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 approximate volume and oil for refilling 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.190
 specific models can be learned from 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.190
 tables 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.619
 in gear and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.020
 and gearboxes aurora 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.530
 it is recommended to fill the transmission 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.690
 oils 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 it is also possible to use a motor 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.040
 oils viscosity data lubrication is good 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 suitable for moving parts 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 transmission oil volume required for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:33.149
 refueling specific models you can find out 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 from the table to control the oil level in 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.149
 engine 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.940
 on the filler caps are available 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.850
 probes to these models of cultivators 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.020
 attached extended probe to control 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.020
 gearbox oils 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.650
 oil level should be around 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.990
 in the middle of a field of risk it happens that 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.570
 unsuccessful motoblock rolls during storage 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.320
 or transport lead to leaks 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.420
 grease 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 be sure to check the oil level 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.820
 before each launch of the tiller recall 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.100
 the first oil change should be made 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.070
 after 20 hours of work 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.200
 then every 100 hours drain plug 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.320
 engine is located at the bottom 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.780
 body drain plug gearbox and 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 gearbox is also located at the lowest point 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.710
 this node proceed to start next 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 cars 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.460
 if the walker is equipped with electronic 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.280
 ignition system 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.530
 just open the fuel tap 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.700
 lock the emergency stop handle 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.890
 and turn the key if the starter is manual 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 will need to translate the air damper 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.630
 in the closed position 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.630
 set the average speed on the accelerator and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.910
 open the fuel cock 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.670
 starting cord on itself until the beginning 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.700
 resistance then a sharp movement 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.130
 start the engine and do not forget to open 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.739
 air damper after several 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.110
 seconds idle work and warm up 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.600
 engine stop engine motoblock 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.050
 it is possible by means of the handle emergency 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.630
 stopping for the motor to stall enough 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.470
 release the lever also on some 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.140
 models 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.510
 set the stop switch 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.380
 motor stands separately on 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.230
 launch aurora gardner 550 mini 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.420
 there is no air damper on this unit 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.550
 and fuel crane to run 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.750
 cultivator enough to pump 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.540
 fuel in the carburetor 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.080
 hand pump and with starter 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.900
 cord 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.560
 start the engine 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.820
 help reduce its speed 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.550
 micro switch on the carburetor after 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.300
 turning the throttle disconnects the circuit 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.000
 ignition 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.700
 at the start of diesel vehicles equipped 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.550
 de compressor have a few subtleties 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.350
 which are worth to say especially so in 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.200
 time manual start well 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.450
 push down the decompressor lever 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.640
 holding the foot pressed should 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.460
 turn the engine shaft with a manual starter 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.980
 until the lever is locked 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.530
 further follows strongly and evenly 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.600
 pull the starter cord after this 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.760
 the engine should work 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.760
 notice when you start the engine 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.550
 using electric starter decompressor 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.610
 on models equipped with this device 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.750
 must be turned off friendly shoots 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.750
 and abundant harvest
