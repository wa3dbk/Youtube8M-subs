00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
temperatures up a bit so you will notice

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.670 
temperatures up a bit so you will notice
slightly<00:01:39.030> warmer<00:01:39.360> conditions<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.530> will

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
slightly warmer conditions and it will

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
slightly warmer conditions and it will
be<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:41.040> breezy<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.640> times<00:01:41.670> again<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:43.140> not

be a bit breezy at times again we're not

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
be a bit breezy at times again we're not

looking at any advisory level winds at
this<00:01:45.659> point<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.860> breezy<00:01:47.340> gusts

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
this point but it will be breezy gusts

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.609 
this point but it will be breezy gusts
on<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.420> especially<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> fire

on and off especially in the fire

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
on and off especially in the fire
location<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:50.820> patchy<00:01:51.060> coastal

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
location and just some patchy coastal

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
location and just some patchy coastal
fog<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.200> along<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> coast<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.310> see

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
fog so right along the coast we will see

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
fog so right along the coast we will see
some<00:01:54.030> low<00:01:54.240> clouds<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> fog<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.799> about

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
some low clouds and fog but that's about

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.560 
some low clouds and fog but that's about
it<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.430> far<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> marine<00:01:57.240> layer<00:01:57.390> right

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it as far as the marine layer right

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.600 
it as far as the marine layer right
around<00:01:57.750> 1,000<00:01:58.350> feet<00:01:58.469> deep<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.490> be

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
around 1,000 feet deep and it will be

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.670 
around 1,000 feet deep and it will be
burning<00:01:59.850> off<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.329> quickly

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
burning off very quickly

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.840 
burning off very quickly
temperature-wise<00:02:01.680> today<00:02:02.219> we<00:02:02.399> made<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.700> into

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
temperature-wise today we made it into

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.999 
temperature-wise today we made it into
the<00:02:02.939> upper<00:02:03.149> 70s<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.110> warmer<00:02:04.590> than<00:02:04.740> we've<00:02:04.979> been

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the upper 70s so warmer than we've been

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.789 
the upper 70s so warmer than we've been
in<00:02:05.340> about<00:02:05.700> 12<00:02:06.030> days<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.930> temperatures<00:02:07.409> still

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
in about 12 days but temperatures still

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
in about 12 days but temperatures still
below<00:02:08.250> average<00:02:08.280> normal<00:02:09.030> high<00:02:09.300> 85<00:02:09.959> degrees

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
below average normal high 85 degrees

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
below average normal high 85 degrees
I'll<00:02:10.830> look<00:02:11.039> at<00:02:11.190> our<00:02:11.280> current<00:02:11.459> temperatures

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I'll look at our current temperatures

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.300 
I'll look at our current temperatures
anywhere<00:02:12.180> from<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.720> low

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
anywhere from the low

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.839 
anywhere from the low
60s<00:02:13.819> downtown<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.930> 63<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.920> corona<00:02:16.370> we're

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
60s downtown to 63 in corona we're

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.640 
60s downtown to 63 in corona we're
looking<00:02:17.090> at<00:02:17.180> temps<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:17.690> into<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> 50s<00:02:18.470> in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
looking at temps now into the 50s in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.949 
looking at temps now into the 50s in
ventura<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.489> again<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.569> mostly

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
ventura and again we do have mostly

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.750 
ventura and again we do have mostly
clear<00:02:21.319> skies<00:02:21.349> right<00:02:21.860> now<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.220> that's<00:02:22.400> allowing

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
clear skies right now so that's allowing

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.640 
clear skies right now so that's allowing
those<00:02:22.880> temperatures<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.630> continue<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.410> cool

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
those temperatures to continue to cool

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.729 
those temperatures to continue to cool
down<00:02:25.030> into<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.150> overnight<00:02:26.450> hours<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:27.440> as

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
down into the overnight hours but as

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.440 
down into the overnight hours but as
that<00:02:28.190> ridge<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.459> high<00:02:28.550> pressure<00:02:28.580> builds<00:02:29.330> in

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that ridge of high pressure builds in

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.059 
that ridge of high pressure builds in
over<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.810> next<00:02:29.840> few<00:02:30.200> days<00:02:30.380> you'll<00:02:30.620> notice

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
over the next few days you'll notice

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.559 
over the next few days you'll notice
some<00:02:31.099> warmer<00:02:31.610> temperatures<00:02:32.120> will<00:02:32.300> be<00:02:32.420> into

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
some warmer temperatures will be into

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.900 
some warmer temperatures will be into
the<00:02:32.660> 80s<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.319> basin<00:02:33.709> 90s<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.400> valleys

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
the 80s in the basin 90s in the valleys

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.210 
the 80s in the basin 90s in the valleys
again<00:02:35.480> triple<00:02:35.870> digit<00:02:36.319> heat<00:02:36.349> in<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.860> mountains

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
again triple digit heat in the mountains

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
again triple digit heat in the mountains
and<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.459> desert<00:02:38.060> locations<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.080> eventually

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
and the desert locations that eventually

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.050 
and the desert locations that eventually
will<00:02:39.769> shift<00:02:39.980> back<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.519> onshore<00:02:40.730> flow

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
will shift back to that onshore flow

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.240 
will shift back to that onshore flow
bringing<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.140> marine<00:02:42.440> layer<00:02:42.470> again<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
bringing in the marine layer again and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.470 
bringing in the marine layer again and
eventually<00:02:43.370> cooling<00:02:44.120> down<00:02:44.269> those

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
eventually cooling down those

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.240 
eventually cooling down those
temperatures<00:02:44.900> let's<00:02:45.620> take<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> look<00:02:46.069> at<00:02:46.160> your

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
temperatures let's take a look at your

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.360 
temperatures let's take a look at your
five-day<00:02:46.640> forecast<00:02:46.910> so
