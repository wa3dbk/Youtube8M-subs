00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.749 
of complicated look
but<00:04:25.509> you<00:04:25.810> know<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.470> get<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.770> hang<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.100> if

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
but you know you get the hang of it if

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.760 
but you know you get the hang of it if
you<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.000> cobblestone<00:04:28.630> in<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.930> upper<00:04:29.259> left

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you do cobblestone in the upper left

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.010 
you do cobblestone in the upper left
corner<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.460> this<00:04:30.490> kind<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.389> making<00:04:31.570> an<00:04:31.810> arrow

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
corner like this kind of making an arrow

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.770 
corner like this kind of making an arrow
kind<00:04:32.470> of<00:04:32.560> shape<00:04:32.740> stick<00:04:33.699> here<00:04:33.970> stick<00:04:34.270> here<00:04:34.509> and

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
kind of shape stick here stick here and

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.840 
kind of shape stick here stick here and
string<00:04:35.169> in<00:04:35.380> these<00:04:35.560> places<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.160> get<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.430> basic

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
string in these places you get the basic

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.439 
string in these places you get the basic
cost<00:04:37.090> fo<00:04:37.300> mechanism<00:04:37.990> if<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:39.280> do<00:04:39.490> iron<00:04:39.910> ingot

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
cost fo mechanism if you do iron ingot

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.689 
cost fo mechanism if you do iron ingot
in<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.350> place<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.590> this<00:04:41.889> cobblestone<00:04:42.460> but

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
in the place of this cobblestone but

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.340 
in the place of this cobblestone but
these<00:04:42.910> two<00:04:43.120> cobblestone<00:04:43.660> these<00:04:44.050> four

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
these two cobblestone these four

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.439 
these two cobblestone these four
cobblestone<00:04:44.919> places<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.669> same<00:04:45.910> as<00:04:46.120> over

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
cobblestone places are the same as over

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.620 
cobblestone places are the same as over
here<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.800> put<00:04:48.009> this<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.729> basic<00:04:49.270> crossbow

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
here and you put this the basic crossbow

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.010 
here and you put this the basic crossbow
mechanism<00:04:50.169> here<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:51.270> string<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.539> same<00:04:52.780> way

light automatic crossbow mechanism and
the<00:04:59.830> next<00:05:00.010> one<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.280> iron<00:05:00.850> ingots<00:05:01.240> just<00:05:01.510> like

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
the next one is iron ingots just like

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.120 
the next one is iron ingots just like
the<00:05:01.780> cobblestone<00:05:02.199> up<00:05:02.289> here<00:05:02.500> kind<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.770> forming

automatic<00:05:09.760> crossbow<00:05:10.180> mechanism<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.900> just

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
automatic crossbow mechanism you just

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.659 
automatic crossbow mechanism you just
put<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:11.320> in<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.470> middle<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.889> you'll<00:05:12.490> get<00:05:12.610> the

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
put it in the middle and you'll get the

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.170 
put it in the middle and you'll get the
medium<00:05:13.240> automatic<00:05:13.840> crossbow<00:05:14.289> mechanism<00:05:14.949> I

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
medium automatic crossbow mechanism I

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.040

know<00:05:16.180> that's<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.599> huge<00:05:16.990> item<00:05:17.349> or<00:05:18.180> big<00:05:19.180> words<00:05:19.419> but

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
know that's a huge item or big words but

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.620 
know that's a huge item or big words but
anyway<00:05:20.590> put<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.550> diamond<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.300> place<00:05:22.599> of

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
anyway put a diamond in the place of

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.870 
anyway put a diamond in the place of
this<00:05:22.960> one<00:05:23.229> is<00:05:23.560> like<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:23.949> here<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.280> put<00:05:24.430> iron<00:05:24.669> in

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
this one is like up here you put iron in

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.550 
this one is like up here you put iron in
place<00:05:25.030> of<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.270> one<00:05:25.449> what<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> diamond<00:05:26.440> in

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
why I didn't want to go over them all

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.360 
why I didn't want to go over them all
but<00:07:08.240> you<00:07:08.539> know<00:07:08.750> but<00:07:09.590> the<00:07:09.800> explosive

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
but you know but the explosive

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.270 
but you know but the explosive
attachment<00:07:11.060> it's<00:07:11.389> pretty<00:07:11.860> pretty<00:07:12.860> obvious

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
attachment it's pretty pretty obvious

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.930

what<00:07:13.820> that<00:07:14.000> does<00:07:15.520> they<00:07:16.520> explode<00:07:18.550> but<00:07:19.550> I<00:07:19.580> think

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
what that does they explode but I think

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.700 
what that does they explode but I think
it<00:07:20.120> takes<00:07:20.150> a<00:07:20.510> little<00:07:20.660> bit<00:07:20.840> of<00:07:20.900> time<00:07:21.199> so<00:07:21.560> it's

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
it takes a little bit of time so it's

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.760 
it takes a little bit of time so it's
kind<00:07:21.949> of<00:07:22.010> like<00:07:22.300> goodnight<00:07:23.320> when<00:07:24.320> you<00:07:24.410> pull<00:07:24.620> the
