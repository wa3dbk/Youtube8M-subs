all these years low blood pressure and

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.120 
all these years low blood pressure and
this<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.770> exercise<00:05:19.460> is<00:05:19.760> my<00:05:19.970> heart<00:05:20.300> and

circulatory system where it gets be
standing<00:05:26.270> up<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:28.420> doing<00:05:29.420> I<00:05:29.780> have<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:29.990> see<00:05:30.260> that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
standing up and doing I have to see that

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.280 
standing up and doing I have to see that
go<00:05:30.620> up<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.010> down<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.250> lot<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:32.390> then<00:05:32.900> we<00:05:33.050> have<00:05:33.140> my

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
go up and down a lot and then we have my

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.230 
go up and down a lot and then we have my
blood<00:05:33.560> pressure<00:05:33.830> start<00:05:34.220> off<00:05:34.490> on<00:05:34.730> you<00:05:34.940> drop

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
blood pressure start off on you drop

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.620 
blood pressure start off on you drop
down<00:05:35.540> if<00:05:36.230> it's<00:05:38.290> whatever<00:05:39.290> we<00:05:39.560> need<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.710> do<00:05:40.040> and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
down if it's whatever we need to do and

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.170 
down if it's whatever we need to do and
sometimes<00:05:42.220> impaired<00:05:43.220> feeling<00:05:43.760> and

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
sometimes impaired feeling and

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.450 
sometimes impaired feeling and
unfortunately<00:05:47.180> most<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.930> my<00:05:48.220> fielding<00:05:49.220> comes

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
unfortunately most of my fielding comes

00:05:49.460 --> 00:06:00.150 
unfortunately most of my fielding comes
to<00:05:49.670> pain<00:05:49.940> side<00:05:50.890> move<00:05:51.890> around<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:53.570> adjust

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.720 

instead<00:06:01.160> of<00:06:01.340> just<00:06:01.990> travel<00:06:02.990> so<00:06:03.890> the<00:06:03.920> chair<00:06:04.400> has

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
instead of just travel so the chair has

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.410 
instead of just travel so the chair has
really<00:06:05.240> changed<00:06:05.600> my<00:06:05.720> life<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.200> it<00:06:07.070> is
