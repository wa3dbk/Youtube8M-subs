00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
decided for this color because I thought

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.130 
decided for this color because I thought
it<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.800> feminine<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.520> very<00:00:32.550> cheery<00:00:33.239> it

kind of matches my flowers over here and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.229 
kind of matches my flowers over here and

is my black one I think I'm gonna have
to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.159> more<00:01:17.340> careful<00:01:17.909> with

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to be a little bit more careful with

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
to be a little bit more careful with
this<00:01:18.450> pink<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> lighter

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
this pink one because it is a lighter

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
this pink one because it is a lighter
color<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> also<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> interior<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.479> white

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
color and also the interior is white

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
color and also the interior is white
where's<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.890> black<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.700> whole<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
where's my black one the whole thing is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.270 
where's my black one the whole thing is
just<00:01:24.299> black<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:25.740> wondering<00:01:26.009> if

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just black and I'm also wondering if

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.590 
just black and I'm also wondering if
these<00:01:26.400> creases<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> show<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these creases are going to show a little

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
these creases are going to show a little
bit<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.920> light<00:01:29.130> color<00:01:29.340> bags<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:29.790> if

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bit more on the light color bags or if

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
bit more on the light color bags or if
they'll<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.150> kind<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> fade<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.840> use<00:01:31.079> as

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they'll just kind of fade with use as

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.580 
they'll just kind of fade with use as
well<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:32.430> well<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.930> that<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.229> pretty<00:01:34.530> much

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
well as as well as that but pretty much

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.730

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on Shan types the first one was a pink

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.830 
on Shan types the first one was a pink
one<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> silver<00:01:55.680> chain<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> had<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:57.000> sort

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
one with a silver chain in had to sort

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920 
one with a silver chain in had to sort
of<00:01:57.960> turn<00:01:58.860> lock<00:01:59.040> clasps<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.299> saw<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> one

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
of turn lock clasps I saw that one

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.929 
of turn lock clasps I saw that one
online<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.799> when<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> went<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> store<00:02:02.790> they

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
online and when I went to the store they

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.090 
online and when I went to the store they
didn't<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> when<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> looked<00:02:04.950> back

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
didn't have it and when I looked back

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.880 
didn't have it and when I looked back
online<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.210> wasn't<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.689> anymore<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
online it wasn't there anymore and so I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.680 
online it wasn't there anymore and so I
think<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.729> have<00:02:09.000> discontinued<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think that they have discontinued the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059 
think that they have discontinued the
bag<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.259> probably<00:02:10.410> sold<00:02:10.709> their<00:02:10.890> last

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
bag and so they probably sold their last

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.140 
bag and so they probably sold their last
one<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
one and that was it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210 
one and that was it
I'm<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> little<00:02:13.409> bit<00:02:13.530> sad<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.890> didn't<00:02:14.099> get<00:02:14.159> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I'm a little bit sad that I didn't get a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
I'm a little bit sad that I didn't get a
chance<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.700> look<00:02:14.819> at<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.689> part<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> me<00:02:16.049> is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
casual undone look you can do that

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.750 
casual undone look you can do that
otherwise<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.260> has<00:03:46.440> these<00:03:46.709> two<00:03:46.769> snap<00:03:47.340> closures

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
otherwise it has these two snap closures

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.809 
otherwise it has these two snap closures
that<00:03:47.909> makes<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.299> super<00:03:49.549> secure<00:03:50.549> feeling

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
that makes it super secure feeling

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.740 
that makes it super secure feeling
versus<00:03:51.299> like<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.900> guess<00:03:52.049> one<00:03:52.260> snap<00:03:52.560> closure<00:03:52.829> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
versus like I guess one snap closure and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.280 
versus like I guess one snap closure and
I<00:03:54.750> really<00:03:55.680> do<00:03:55.940> like<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.329> chain<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.049> I
