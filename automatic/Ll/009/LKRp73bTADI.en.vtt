00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Nine people today I'll show you the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:18.270
 he ship mod and he leads this 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 airship after the mod 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.840
 have installed you have to first 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.800
 Airship forces or a balloon 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.199
 hot air balloon, so to speak, just one 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.779
 That's what he makes of any airship 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.930
 I want two ropes and one oven 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.420
 boot then you have a rather ship that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 then you place a short wait 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.760
 until it seems so ragged find that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 looks really cool and like in the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.149
 Could it be with anyone 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 be any color 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.469
 I just wanted to with blue 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.020
 just like that and that goes by her 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.270
 just right-click enter as 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.059
 have here now in hand per right click 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 get in and you'll be up soon 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.680
 again why are you falling back ? 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.729
 Press and hold z 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.790
 to ascend and if you hurt 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.030
 then you actually drive already and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 cool particles are what you but come 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.759
 note must you have carbon in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 have inventory and that then teaches itself 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 automatically so you do not have to 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.720
 We can just start driving 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.079
 you control with wsd as usual 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:39.509
 with the right to it with ahmed a 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:42.090
 to the left and back so there 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.520
 turns then seems a while so then 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.649
 hurts and I just hit it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.619
 again z to even in the height 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.920
 rise and those cool particles die 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.259
 now come back to astonish 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.689
 marvel at it and then it looks like this 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 only first person perspective 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 and you can also control with the mouse 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.280
 as you can see when i go to 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.110
 look right or look to the left 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.430
 that sells itself but needs it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.530
 Do not write her in the comments 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.530
 and oh my god, what is that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.069
 wanted with this bad spectacle 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 I 'll show you if you're full speed 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.800
 somewhere against heated now is still 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 in it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.110
 then a hole is in the wall in the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.860
 rhein are driving and your balloon 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.950
 destroyed that because I mod the aircraft 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.810
 You can not say more than that you have 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.269
 fallible flight vehicles so airships 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.760
 you could become and why fly 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.319
 Can you need cabbage in the inventory and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.910
 that 's it with the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.910
 ship mod and ciao
