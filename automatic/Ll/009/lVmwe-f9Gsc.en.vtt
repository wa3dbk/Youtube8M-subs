00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.450 
the 13th I think my fight will be
against<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.840> more<00:00:27.500> experienced<00:00:27.919> side<00:00:28.099> he'll<00:00:28.369> be

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
against a more experienced side he'll be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.220 
against a more experienced side he'll be
a<00:00:28.490> little<00:00:28.730> bit<00:00:29.000> smaller<00:00:29.360> than<00:00:29.480> me<00:00:29.720> but<00:00:30.020> he<00:00:30.140> has

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
a little bit smaller than me but he has

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.670 
a little bit smaller than me but he has
like<00:00:30.410> 80<00:00:30.650> 90<00:00:31.130> fights<00:00:31.369> Dom<00:00:32.329> said<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:32.930> should<00:00:33.649> be
