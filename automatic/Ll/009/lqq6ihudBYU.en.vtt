00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.200
 Where do we come from? 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.360
 Where do we come from: Are we still evolving? 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.570
 Said that humans have stopped evolving. 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.020
 But is this true? 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.770
 The truth is that we are still evolving today. 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.050
 Even if we are in the future, 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.200
 It is embedded in our biological infrastructure 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 Evolution will continue 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.120
 Because of the way our DNA replicates and mixes itself 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 When sperm and eggs are produced 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 Randomly shuffled genes between generations 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.120
 Let every generation be born unique 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.550
 Charles Darwin's "natural selection theory" 

00:00:56.552 --> 00:01:00.030
 Based on most organisms including humans 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.810
 All show the facts of physiological and genetic variation 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.210
 Some people can adapt better as long as the environment changes slightly 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.240
 Because of their unique DNA 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.620
 These people will have more descendants 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 They will survive and pass on their DNA to the next generation. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.160
 At the moment, we are changing the environment to a large extent. 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.420
 Global warming pollution is getting worse 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.700
 Abuse of antibiotic insects to develop resistance 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 Lack of a sporty lifestyle and dependence on technology 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.440
 There is also a delay in childbirth until the age of thirty or forty. 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.400
 Any of these changes may force humans to accelerate evolution. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.590
 Changes may occur in our immune system 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.080
 The number of causative genes carried by our sweat gland sperm 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.530
 Some even affect our skeletal muscles and nervous system 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 Sounds like itâ€™s out of reach 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.860
 We did a case study on modern evolution. 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.720
 The invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago led to mutations in our genes. 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.420
 As a descendant of farming ancestors, scientists speculate 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.240
 We have more than 70% genetic variation and 90% of disease-causing genes 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.690
 Produced between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.540
 The sheer volume of genetic evolution in such a short period of time is shocking 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.360
 Everything comes from a huge change in lifestyle 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.210
 Hunting and gathering ends the beginning of agricultural farming 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.120
 We have millions of people around the world from 10,000 years ago 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.160
 Growing to the 7 billion people today 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.270
 All huddled on this little planet 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.100
 Some geneticists even think 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.560
 Amazing rare genetic lesions in the past 5,000 years 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.310
 May cause humans to evolve new species 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.600
 Will there be obvious changes in the future? 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.730
 Such as the visible difference between different species 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.000
 Some even predict that the future humans can decide the fate of their own evolution. 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.680
 Constructing your body through genetic technology 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830
 In order to achieve a life span of hundreds of years 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.080
 Or perfectly adapted to survive in space 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.600
 The challenge we face is 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.970
 Make sure that no one is going to be poor 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.060
 Unable to enjoy the benefits of genetic engineering and new medical technology 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.180
 Evolution will continue 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.680
 But unlike any previous era 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.890
 Now we understand the cause of it 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.860
 Can respond to the results that come with the well-being of all mankind 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.100
