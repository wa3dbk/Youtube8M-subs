00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.459
 let's create a new graphic program from scratch 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.060
 we introduce the width of the sheet 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.739
 the thick 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.189
 the type of material with the resistance 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.189
 the matrix that we are going to use in the slot 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.329
 the punch 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.329
 and if we want a comment 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.450
 10 to 1 for example 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.340
 once confirmed we are asked for the developments we will make a tribute 25 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 finally account 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.930
 for 50 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.400
 for 50 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.680
 and finally for 25 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.990
 Once the omega is done, we can calculate 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.900
 how it is going to bend 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.610
 we have two options we can try him simulate 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.230
 With which 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.680
 yes there is a collision point tells us that it has no solution 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.230
 or we can try to bend the hand 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.340
 in which we have where is on the verge of collision 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.950
 we can 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 solving the problem we had 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.180
 as you can see in this red zone is at the point of collision 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.440
 to solve it we return to the graphic 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.570
 and this measure will no longer be marked at 50 we can expand to 55 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 azimi effect that the last full touches us 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.550
 now he uses it 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 if we change exposure 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 the against 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 the solution 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.690
 without touching 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.280
 it is accepted 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.330
 and from there we can 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.470
 simulate 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 how will they be double in the machine
