cloaks<00:05:25.199> robes<00:05:26.009> Jedi<00:05:26.430> robes<00:05:26.669> for<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.750> Jedi<00:05:28.050> but

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
cloaks robes Jedi robes for the Jedi but

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.320 
cloaks robes Jedi robes for the Jedi but
of<00:05:28.379> course<00:05:28.590> they're<00:05:29.310> harder<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:29.669> animate<00:05:30.150> and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
of course they're harder to animate and

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.390 
of course they're harder to animate and
the<00:05:30.509> Clone<00:05:30.659> Wars<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.590> rarely<00:05:32.009> see<00:05:32.190> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
the Clone Wars so I you rarely see the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.100 
the Clone Wars so I you rarely see the
Jedi<00:05:32.580> wither<00:05:32.819> with<00:05:33.210> their<00:05:33.360> cloaks<00:05:33.630> with<00:05:33.960> their

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
Jedi wither with their cloaks with their

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.570 
Jedi wither with their cloaks with their
robes<00:05:34.319> it's<00:05:35.009> because<00:05:35.250> they're<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.400> lot<00:05:35.520> tougher

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
robes it's because they're a lot tougher

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.659 
robes it's because they're a lot tougher
dye<00:05:35.969> hadn't<00:05:36.210> made<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.419> course<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.889> but<00:05:38.069> uh<00:05:38.130> we

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
dye hadn't made of course and but uh we

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.149 
dye hadn't made of course and but uh we
did<00:05:38.849> see<00:05:39.060> them<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.240> couple<00:05:39.539> times<00:05:39.889> so<00:05:40.889> but<00:05:41.099> it

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
did see them a couple times so but it

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:42.260 
did see them a couple times so but it
would<00:05:41.250> have<00:05:41.340> been<00:05:41.430> nice<00:05:41.520> if<00:05:41.550> Hasbro<00:05:41.909> included

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
would have been nice if Hasbro included

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.510 
would have been nice if Hasbro included
it<00:05:42.330> but<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.509> course<00:05:42.719> they<00:05:43.289> don't<00:05:43.469> need<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.800> in

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
it but of course they don't need to in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.330 
it but of course they don't need to in
this<00:05:44.639> case<00:05:44.849> because<00:05:45.360> they<00:05:45.630> weren't<00:05:45.810> seen

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
this case because they weren't seen

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.059 
this case because they weren't seen
