00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.170
 macrumors has now learned that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.760
 publicly the new in equality 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529
 new update ios which has 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.610
 started with a new version of the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:42.740
 same denominated building 11 of 257 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.570
 then there will be bet for has requested to 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.940
 the companies to sign it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 in the new update before this 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.000
 Friday, June 27, indicated 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.220
 we have publicly this week as 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.320
 finally there is a 7.1 in all it says 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.559
 which will also include any improvements 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 connectivity and backup 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.330
 correction of errors related to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.700
 back with the data transfer with 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.160
 third-party accessories such as those from 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.500
 code readers and then until now 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.500
 let's say that these new authorizations 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.110
 will have improvements one of them 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.770
 I think it will be the boom that has 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.270
 balls on the screen of the screen 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.520
 when the locked screen of the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.759
 device 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.850
 as we say in the pits is the call 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.400
 it's a missed call that appears 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.049
 it is hope hope this 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.150
 new use have a little more of 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.619
 those that we do not have 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.030
 information that all are complicated 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.670
 but have one more shot 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.070
 appreciations then let's say that right now 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.570
 I cricket and anime to see a new 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.940
 update let's say that I believed that 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.009
 was going to happen to them done and it was already beginning 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.130
 to go up because you have not already we will have 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.820
 in this week a video received the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.149
 use of 7.1 points 2 then up 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.100
 let's just say everything is fine all 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.709
 comes to be positive is but I think that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.540
 they still need a little more but 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.060
 according to right now for there are months such 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.120
 is not included but let's say that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.660
 maybe in a next use already 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 come and bring 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.920
 the corrected to this problem then not 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.140
 I hope you are very well 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.630
 information imagine that many of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.670
 you should know it but good 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.960
 channel of the passionate support is rather 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.970
 for those who are 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.680
 that is because he likes to have information 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 iphone 6 device and all that I hope 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.530
 that is very good because the mass of 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.530
