00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
incredibly versatile so we want to take

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
incredibly versatile so we want to take
our<00:01:42.000> biscuits<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
our biscuits and we're just going to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.510 
our biscuits and we're just going to
pinch<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.610> apart<00:01:45.740> however<00:01:46.740> large<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.280> want

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
pinch them apart however large you want

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
pinch them apart however large you want
and<00:01:47.729> we're<00:01:47.820> gonna<00:01:47.909> roll<00:01:48.270> them<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.659> little

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and we're gonna roll them into little

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
and we're gonna roll them into little
balls

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
balls

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
balls
so<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> drop<00:01:52.320> them<00:01:52.500> into<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> sugar<00:01:53.219> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
so and drop them into the sugar and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.639 
so and drop them into the sugar and
cinnamon<00:01:54.090> mixture<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:56.189> probably<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.909> three

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
cinnamon mixture you probably get three

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.039 
cinnamon mixture you probably get three
balls<00:01:58.649> per<00:01:59.250> biscuit<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.750> drop<00:02:00.930> them

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
balls per biscuit so you just drop them

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
balls per biscuit so you just drop them
