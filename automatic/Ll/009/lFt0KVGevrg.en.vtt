00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:06.310
 Talk to you guys 1min20 once more another videotape of the course in you 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.800
 on day 23 10 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.279
 decides to start with a net point 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.299
 good in this year's video taxi driver we're learning right? 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.439
 O 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.529
 destroy objects 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.580
 but you simply come here slow or destroyed during the game by 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.719
 example Ã©rica when you are you believe in one of the games of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.470
 by car for example 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.669
 then the person gets off the track 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 You have to destroy my car object. 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.970
 and then make them appear 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.160
 in the middle of the track 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.710
 next year let's put 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 so if the first quarter after it did it appears 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.040
 here is alone the agency isna how to make me destroy 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.370
 so first can be here several in the ball to pain ball jumps of the year 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 who chooses a precedent do not want anyone 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.850
 another that I preferred to put everything and I do not know 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.250
 to keep jumping 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.380
 I came here written client right button 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 we had to have other effects 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.390
 the scoreboard 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 games took the idol 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
 when I understand and not mine 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 he applies it in edit he came to dictate 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.980
 only as it was once the function the attendant realization is inside 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.850
 her 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 to each frame 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.710
 it was in the processed fairing 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.550
 only that it does not have as you say that objective the same manager aces being that 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.409
 already destroyed 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050
 kaboul tottenham 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.010
 so we're going to function these people 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.830
 who knows of association when a game 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.950
 already loading when the start of the game a single time cable 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 then make up in the start function 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 10 Worse still 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.270
 and I'll put it here to destroy 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.389
 the object 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.199
 without him 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.019
 the bed 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 ivo crack and yes a variable late 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.289
 corrected 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.829
 I avoid 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.049
 create a variable 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.049
 destroy the object to be destroyed 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.249
 in which adds that a point and a half 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.499
 Silas has some error 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.819
 it's not right 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.249
 mccormick 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.150
 So 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.479
 still 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.479
 neither do we 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.489
 and I'll put the name blistering 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.079
 everything that I did 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.379
 P 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.409
 one of three ambulances 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.409
 in psi-20 yields variable 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.429
 it checks simple 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.709
 Okay, that has to be correct. 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.279
 intended for some error 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.929
 remembering that the javascript and here sensitive is 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:04.879

 here i think so too 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.219
 queer 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.969
 every pause that tries to fix the already dead request 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.550
 and I thought I already know what I did wrong 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.669
 who places relatives written 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.180

 when you come home 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.409
 I have none 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.129
 I did not create it here 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.240
 and I'll get this one destroyed 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.610
 I'm going to get Albania's name here, it's a descent to equate 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.559
 dolan 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.430
 ideas 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.539
 I go 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.189
 can write 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.020
 madonna interest in sock 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.020
 then part of the teacher opts 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.460
 I'm not going to put this tracking down that the flying board coca put the ball 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.050
 hacker hack 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.740
 It's for I preferred 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.809
 a good study 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.809

 ballestreri 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.969
 from here 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.300
 You can see right here in the camera. 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.909
 I did not stop 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:53.620
 weird 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.050
 and you can put 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.280
 intercurrent prescription while playing with three options is one thing 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.240

 just that 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.210
 to detect 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.319
 faithful to you say about some object is that 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.319
 in addition in something else if you that already destroyed objects 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.210
 only after a few and you can not speak of a building that housed 5 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.770
 In other words, it will be subject to five seconds 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 so I stopped 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:36.629
