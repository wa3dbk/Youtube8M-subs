00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the packaging looks this is the watch

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
the packaging looks this is the watch
and<00:00:33.110> there<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.200> nothing<00:00:34.380> else<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:36.390> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
Aliexpress because some of the times the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
Aliexpress because some of the times the
colors<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.450> correct<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> order

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and the seller messes up with that the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.789 
and the seller messes up with that the
