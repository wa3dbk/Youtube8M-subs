00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
because you already know pretty much how

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
because you already know pretty much how
to<00:00:27.720> clay<00:00:27.990> bar<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.830> I'll<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.160> back<00:00:29.279> once<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.640> get

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to clay bar so I'll be back once I get

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.190 
to clay bar so I'll be back once I get
done<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:32.540> okay<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.750> mocked<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
done with that okay so I mocked up the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.870 
done with that okay so I mocked up the
spoiler<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> look

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
spoiler to see how it's going to look

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
spoiler to see how it's going to look
there's<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> cap<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> small<00:00:37.290> gap

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there's going to be a cap of a small gap

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
there's going to be a cap of a small gap
in<00:00:37.649> between<00:00:37.770> sides<00:00:38.300> already

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
in between sides already

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770 
in between sides already
clay<00:00:39.930> barred<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.410> everything<00:00:41.149> but<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
clay barred it and everything but I just

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350 
clay barred it and everything but I just
mocked<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.950> put<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> somewhat<00:00:45.090> netted

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
mocked it and I put the somewhat netted

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
mocked it and I put the somewhat netted
tape<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.469> could<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.649> ready<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.700> only

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
tape so it could be ready to go the only

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.310 
tape so it could be ready to go the only
thing<00:00:48.030> I'm<00:00:48.120> doing<00:00:48.149> different<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
thing I'm doing different and take it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.700 
thing I'm doing different and take it
off<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:51.149> actual<00:00:51.690> TRD<00:00:52.020> spoiler<00:00:52.440> actually

screws<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.160> didn't<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> drill

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
screws because I didn't want to drill

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.660 
screws because I didn't want to drill
into<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.149> bumper<00:01:00.949> but<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.460> just

into the bumper but right now I'm just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.780 
into the bumper but right now I'm just
locking<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> fits<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.310 

it's<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:09.119> well<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.170> see

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's pretty well as you could see

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's pretty well as you could see
there's<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.950> body<00:01:11.220> line<00:01:11.460> right

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's going to be this body line right

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.630 
there's going to be this body line right
here<00:01:12.740> you're<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> follow<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
here you're just going to follow it and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.950 
here you're just going to follow it and
it's<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.030> towards<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.780> up

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's going to go towards the back up

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's going to go towards the back up
spoiler<00:01:16.290> try<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:18.299> both

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
spoiler try to do that on this on both

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
spoiler try to do that on this on both
sides<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.080> way<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> even

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sides that way you actually get it even

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
sides that way you actually get it even
like<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.780> example<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like for example right right now I just

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.010 
like for example right right now I just
put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> down<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> saw<00:01:24.240> me<00:01:24.299> take<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
put it down you saw me take it out and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
put it down you saw me take it out and
you<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.280> none<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.970> there

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you don't want none of that right there

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.940 
you don't want none of that right there
because<00:01:27.509> there's<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> bigger<00:01:28.439> gap<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.829> here

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
because there's a bigger gap over here

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
because there's a bigger gap over here
so<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.600> move<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so all you have to do just move it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.679 
so all you have to do just move it
around<00:01:32.750> until<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.259> equal<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.860> both<00:01:34.890> sides

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.250 

just<00:01:39.689> tape<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.960 

so<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:45.100> want<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.370> make<00:01:45.490> sure<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.790> it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
so you just want to make sure that it's

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.150 
so you just want to make sure that it's
even<00:01:46.300> on<00:01:46.390> both<00:01:46.450> sides<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:47.290> for<00:01:47.500> example<00:01:47.560> oh

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
even on both sides like for example oh
