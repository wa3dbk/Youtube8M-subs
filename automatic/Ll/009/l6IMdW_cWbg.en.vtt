bomb that dips underneath the crossbar

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.430 
bomb that dips underneath the crossbar
that<00:03:21.890> response<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:23.390> about<00:03:23.720> much<00:03:24.020> more<00:03:24.380> than

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
that response is about much more than

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.380 
that response is about much more than
putting<00:03:25.069> her<00:03:25.160> team<00:03:25.400> ahead<00:03:25.730> although<00:03:26.239> that's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
putting her team ahead although that's

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.370 
putting her team ahead although that's
the<00:03:26.569> priority

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
the priority

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.770 
the priority
I<00:03:27.530> think<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.190> relief<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.090> knowing

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
I think there's relief in that knowing

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.590 
I think there's relief in that knowing
that<00:03:30.500> she's<00:03:30.680> been<00:03:30.890> waiting<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.670> waiting<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
that she's been waiting and waiting and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270 
that she's been waiting and waiting and
waiting<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:33.140> get<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.380> second<00:03:33.800> goal<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.069> may

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
waiting to get that second goal that may

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.250 
waiting to get that second goal that may
have<00:03:34.400> been<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.580> deflection<00:03:35.090> off<00:03:35.390> Johnston<00:03:36.110> that

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
have been a deflection off Johnston that

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.059 
have been a deflection off Johnston that
led<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.590> topspin<00:03:37.370> Leslie<00:03:38.800> take<00:03:39.800> another

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
led to that topspin Leslie take another

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.290 
led to that topspin Leslie take another
look<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.430> see<00:03:40.519> if<00:03:40.580> we<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.819> pick<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.060> up<00:03:41.150> on

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
look and see if we can pick it up on

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.140 
look and see if we can pick it up on
that<00:03:41.540> angle<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.980> block<00:03:43.220> really<00:03:43.489> did<00:03:43.760> not<00:03:43.940> have

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
that angle the block really did not have

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.830 
that angle the block really did not have
a<00:03:44.180> chance<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.940> strike<00:03:47.180> from<00:03:47.390> Sydney<00:03:47.720> Leroux

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
a chance to strike from Sydney Leroux

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.259 
a chance to strike from Sydney Leroux
couldn't<00:03:48.380> be<00:03:48.470> more<00:03:48.680> happy<00:03:49.069> for<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.610> think
