00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.090

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.710
 stream the diary of a file and from this 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.970
 Once I have a surprise, I'm going to cook. 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.099
 for you because I ask you 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.270
 because in important ones you realize 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.950
 that we can eat many things in the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.050
 our day to day but cooked way 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.880
 more healthful or condiments a fondness 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.540
 in the past there have been some 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.640
 doubts and some back realize better 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 in the comments I have seen in the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.930
 facebook and that's why I came back to my 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.730
 kitchen when it all started 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.160
 to make an arrow that was 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.650
 developed by Dr. sarah africa and 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.050
 by the head suzana kingdom of the canteen 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.080
 star hotel star as is he 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 get out of this question you and a supreme 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.130
 frank with French mash and potato already 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.650
 It 's wonderful to make a 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.470
 full of class but easily 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.210
 adapted to do at home then 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.890
 explain how you're going to see 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.799
 which is very simple and that will power 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 eating delicious things with ease and 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.850
 few calories then we'll need 160 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.069
 free port grams will leave the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.009
 marinade in white wine garlic thyme 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.229
 sage pepper while I was training 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.649
 Are you going to prepare for this? 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.020
 things feel grams of French gold and 60 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.060
 grams of potatoes separately when 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 be cooked conduct these two 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.579
 food to be involved with five 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.130
 grams of butter and 10 grams sick and 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.359
 had the company of his testimony and 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.359
 stay with these stones 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.799
 however they will also skip some 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.580
 groups with one strand of olive oil 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.570
 in the case of the 8 materiel blocks 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.050
 the inquiry with flower but you can 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.020
 use food as a right - that 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.550
 that you like it more than we will 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.899
 prepare the chicken and in fact already 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.890
 I've prepared to be a 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.570
 simple and not be so long we go 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.620
 seal the chicken and just let nothing else is 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:25.150
 than to force the fire quite 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.930
 have a new neighbor of butter and make 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.420
 is to facilitate the franc just to test 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 But I'll skip the frying pan. 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.209
 I did not burn and jump to the sun left 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.800
 fran and I was scared one side and the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.880
 another that is for when you are staying with 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.480
 look much better and after I have 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.260

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.830
 different games prepared and I already did and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 so there is a weak point with the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.959
 I play them next to each other. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.739
 I found now I will lend to you the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.739

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:37.840

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.480
