00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
possible that means the best designer is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.840

and<00:00:25.050> after<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.359> that's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and after that's all because that's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
and after that's all because that's
clearly<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.769> type<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> product<00:00:29.789> which

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
clearly in this type of product which

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.840 
clearly in this type of product which
are<00:00:30.240> deeply<00:00:30.720> model<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.470> intelligent<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
are deeply model and intelligent the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.680 
are deeply model and intelligent the
interesting<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:34.200> whether<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.820> not

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
interesting thing is whether is in not

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.810 
interesting thing is whether is in not
what<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> around<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:38.460> why<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
what there is around that's why the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.440 
what there is around that's why the
right<00:00:39.420> product<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
right product for this is to have the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.860 
right product for this is to have the
minimum<00:00:43.070> around<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.820> interesting<00:00:45.600> thing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
minimum around the interesting thing

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.729 
minimum around the interesting thing
that's<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.370> almost<00:00:47.940> sad<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that's why it's almost sad but the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.760 
that's why it's almost sad but the
designer<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.280> not<00:00:50.850> enough<00:00:51.440> graduation<00:00:52.440> was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
designer was not enough graduation was

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.850 
designer was not enough graduation was
not<00:00:53.520> enough<00:00:53.879> well<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:55.050> completely<00:00:55.530> disappear

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
not enough well to completely disappear

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
not enough well to completely disappear
and<00:00:56.399> he<00:00:56.940> won't<00:00:57.149> make<00:00:57.360> something<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.379> like

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and he won't make something little like

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
and he won't make something little like
that<00:00:58.949> it'll<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.750> diagonal

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that it'll like that little diagonal

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.299 
that it'll like that little diagonal
like<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.329> sad<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
like that and so little sad because the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.870 
like that and so little sad because the
concept<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.390> madera<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> design<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.490> less

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
concept is madera but the design is less

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320 
concept is madera but the design is less
model<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> guy<00:01:11.000> don't<00:01:12.000> want

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
model because the guy don't want

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
model because the guy don't want
disappear<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:19.770> anybody<00:01:20.189> has<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> product<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
disappear if anybody has a product to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.760 
disappear if anybody has a product to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the list we design it's from redbubble

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 
the list we design it's from redbubble
