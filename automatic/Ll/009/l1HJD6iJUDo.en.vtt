were<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.610> about<00:00:35.850> building<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.480> base

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
were really about building a base

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
were really about building a base
defending<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.620> base<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> building<00:00:38.730> an

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
defending that base and building an

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
defending that base and building an
assault<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.300> army<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> could<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.050> attack

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
assault to army that you could go attack

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.650 
assault to army that you could go attack
the<00:00:40.590> other<00:00:40.710> base<00:00:40.920> first<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.730> said<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.360> we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the other base first thing we said is we

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
the other base first thing we said is we
need<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> kind<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> wash<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> stain<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.760> CNC

far<00:00:45.329> away<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.250> have

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
far away and to do that you really have

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
far away and to do that you really have
