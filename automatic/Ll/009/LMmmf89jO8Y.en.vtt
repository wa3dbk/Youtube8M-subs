best part about holidays is not

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.600 
best part about holidays is not
receiving<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.380> about<00:02:26.590> giving<00:02:26.890> because<00:02:27.310> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
receiving it's about giving because the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.460 
receiving it's about giving because the
more<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.940> give<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.210> more<00:02:28.810> good<00:02:29.170> things

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
more you give the more good things

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.440 
more you give the more good things
happen<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:30.940> I<00:02:30.970> guess<00:02:31.300> we're

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
happen to you and so I guess we're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.590 
happen to you and so I guess we're
trying<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.870> say<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.400> doing<00:02:34.330> little

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
trying to say is is that doing little

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.690 
trying to say is is that doing little
things<00:02:35.020> or<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.530> gestures<00:02:35.980> for<00:02:36.340> yourself

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
things or little gestures for yourself

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.270 
things or little gestures for yourself
and<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:36.970> other<00:02:37.180> people<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:38.280> thinking

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
and for other people is thinking

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640 
and for other people is thinking
positively<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.780> guess<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.350> key<00:02:41.500> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
positively and I guess the key to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.640 
positively and I guess the key to
happiness<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.460> not<00:02:43.180> money<00:02:43.450> first<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.410> it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
happiness is not money first of all it's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.340 
happiness is not money first of all it's
not<00:02:44.800> money<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.120> about<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.930> being<00:02:47.080> positive

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
not money it's about just being positive

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.560 
not money it's about just being positive
that<00:02:47.740> makes<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.190> happy<00:02:48.730> person<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.330> that's
