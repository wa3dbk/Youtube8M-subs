know going along with what I had done

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.780 
know going along with what I had done
with<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.349> previous<00:00:31.740> build<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.700> know

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
with the previous build of you know

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
with the previous build of you know
doing<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.149> kid<00:00:33.420> bro<00:00:33.600> map<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.800> one's<00:00:35.040> not

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
doing this kid bro map this one's not

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.869 
doing this kid bro map this one's not
near<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.329> far<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.350> know

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
near as pretty as far as you know

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
near as pretty as far as you know
reconstructions<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:40.079> only<00:00:40.110> mainly

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
reconstructions go but only mainly

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
reconstructions go but only mainly
because<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> such<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> smaller<00:00:42.120> map<00:00:42.480> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
because this is such a smaller map it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
because this is such a smaller map it's
hard<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> sites<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
hard to get a lot of sites right and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
hard to get a lot of sites right and
there's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.530> things<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> game

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
there's a lot more things in the game

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.930 
there's a lot more things in the game
that<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.820> can't<00:00:48.090> recreate<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:48.840> scratch<00:00:49.940> if

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that I can't recreate it from scratch if

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660 
that I can't recreate it from scratch if
you<00:00:51.809> remember<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> things<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you remember one of the things I you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
you remember one of the things I you
know<00:00:53.879> miss<00:00:54.090> tickler<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.870> doing

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
know miss tickler about what I'm doing

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.080 
know miss tickler about what I'm doing
these<00:00:55.110> recreations<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> only<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.520> material

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
these recreations is only using material

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560 
these recreations is only using material
that<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:57.960> mine<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> find<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.449> by

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that can actually mine and find just by

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
that can actually mine and find just by
playing<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> didn't<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.710> any<00:01:01.920> inventory

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
playing here I didn't use any inventory

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
playing here I didn't use any inventory
editor<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.480> any<00:01:03.690> texture<00:01:04.589> pack<00:01:04.769> obviously<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
editor or any texture pack obviously I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.810 
editor or any texture pack obviously I
use<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> stuff<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.299> could<00:01:06.360> build<00:01:06.900> myself

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
use just as stuff I could build myself

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.620 
use just as stuff I could build myself
so<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.299> did<00:01:12.299> try<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so this is what we have I did try to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
so this is what we have I did try to
maintain<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.830> making<00:01:14.070> sure<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
maintain you know making sure all the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
maintain you know making sure all the
lines<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.790> sight<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.470> know

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
lines of sight look right and you know

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
lines of sight look right and you know
use<00:01:16.799> some<00:01:16.950> creativity<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.909> doing<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
use some creativity and doing some of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.600 
use some creativity and doing some of
the<00:01:18.600> angles<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> things<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the angles but one of the things about a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330 
the angles but one of the things about a
nuke<00:01:21.330> town<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.710> everything<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
nuke town is that everything is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
nuke town is that everything is
definitely<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.479> angles<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
definitely not at right angles and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
definitely not at right angles and
perfect<00:01:25.710> squares<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.400> were<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.909> Skid

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
perfect squares like they were in Skid

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.700 
perfect squares like they were in Skid
Row<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.729> oh<00:01:30.470> hello<00:01:31.470> Kel

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
Row you know that one was oh hello Kel

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.510 
Row you know that one was oh hello Kel
you<00:01:31.979> broke<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.790> hole<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.210> floor<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:35.400> know

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you broke a hole in my floor you know

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
you broke a hole in my floor you know
that<00:01:35.729> map<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.299> nice<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.810> square<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.320> easy<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that map was nice and square and easy to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.499 
that map was nice and square and easy to
do<00:01:38.220> okay<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.479> consuming

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
do okay well it was very time consuming

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.100 
do okay well it was very time consuming
but<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.229> easy<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.180> draw<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
but it's easy to draw out because the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.510 
but it's easy to draw out because the
fact<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:43.770> perfectly<00:01:44.159> square

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
fact that it was perfectly square

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.800 
fact that it was perfectly square
whereas<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.030> everything's<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
whereas this one everything's kind of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
whereas this one everything's kind of
sitting<00:01:46.049> at<00:01:46.170> weird<00:01:46.350> angles<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:47.549> why

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sitting at weird angles so that's why

nicely

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.069 

but<00:04:16.889> yeah<00:04:17.099> I<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:18.209> took<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.479> long<00:04:18.599> time<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:18.870> do

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
but yeah I it took a long time to do

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.700 
but yeah I it took a long time to do
this<00:04:19.259> map<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:21.780> takes<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.139> long<00:04:22.259> time<00:04:22.319> to<00:04:22.530> do

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this map it's it takes a long time to do

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.809 
this map it's it takes a long time to do
any<00:04:22.889> of<00:04:23.009> these<00:04:23.099> kind<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> maps<00:04:23.550> when<00:04:23.699> you're

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
any of these kind of maps when you're

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.339 
any of these kind of maps when you're
doing<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.180> block<00:04:24.419> at<00:04:24.569> a<00:04:24.659> time<00:04:24.689> I<00:04:24.870> mean<00:04:25.139> just

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
doing one block at a time I mean just

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.159 
doing one block at a time I mean just
setting<00:04:25.710> up<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:26.009> the<00:04:27.000> ground<00:04:27.270> here<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:28.020> you

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
setting up the the ground here as you

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.920 
setting up the the ground here as you
receive<00:04:28.469> this<00:04:28.590> kind<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.860> goes<00:04:29.039> out<00:04:29.159> over<00:04:29.189> water

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
receive this kind of goes out over water

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.070 
receive this kind of goes out over water
well<00:04:30.930> in<00:04:31.229> my<00:04:31.580> building<00:04:32.580> experience<00:04:33.050> get<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
well in my building experience get a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.020 
well in my building experience get a
little<00:04:34.259> higher<00:04:34.550> building<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.669> straight<00:04:36.000> out

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
little higher building it straight out

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.730 
little higher building it straight out
over<00:04:36.449> water<00:04:36.719> is<00:04:36.960> easier<00:04:37.319> than<00:04:37.349> trying<00:04:37.650> to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
over water is easier than trying to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.529 
over water is easier than trying to
clear<00:04:37.979> away<00:04:38.099> land<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.879> know<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> cleared<00:04:39.419> away

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
clear away land you know I cleared away

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.760 
clear away land you know I cleared away
quite<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> bit<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.139> land<00:04:40.319> off<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.680> that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
quite a bit of land off in that

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.879 
quite a bit of land off in that
direction<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.669> off<00:04:42.289> that<00:04:43.289> direction<00:04:43.710> i

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
direction and off that direction i

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.800 
direction and off that direction i
believe<00:04:44.189> just<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.699> get<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:44.939> materials<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.689> be

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
believe just to get the materials to be

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.179 
believe just to get the materials to be
able<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:46.020> build<00:04:46.199> all<00:04:46.349> this<00:04:46.530> junk<00:04:46.860> i<00:04:47.069> mean

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
able to build all this junk i mean

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.200 
able to build all this junk i mean
because<00:04:47.340> you<00:04:47.490> can<00:04:47.639> see<00:04:47.759> there's<00:04:47.909> a<00:04:48.000> lot<00:04:48.180> of

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
because you can see there's a lot of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.320 
because you can see there's a lot of
wood<00:04:48.539> involved<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.319> a<00:04:49.469> lot<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.770> dirt<00:04:50.099> and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
cobblestone and you know i just cook the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.339 
cobblestone and you know i just cook the
cobblestone<00:04:54.029> to<00:04:54.210> make<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.569> solid<00:04:55.110> rock

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
cobblestone to make the solid rock

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.080 
cobblestone to make the solid rock
looking<00:04:55.650> thing<00:04:55.949> here<00:04:56.279> i<00:04:56.669> went<00:04:57.569> ahead<00:04:57.629> and

destroyed my incinerator in my chest on

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.010 
destroyed my incinerator in my chest on
the<00:05:02.520> other<00:05:02.699> stuff<00:05:02.909> i<00:05:03.029> had<00:05:03.180> there<00:05:03.360> because<00:05:03.569> well

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
it didn't really have a place in this

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.450 
it didn't really have a place in this
map<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.509> I'm<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.259> didn't<00:05:07.529> do<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.740> garage<00:05:08.099> doors

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
map so I'm I didn't do the garage doors

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.649 
map so I'm I didn't do the garage doors
in<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.729> front<00:05:08.939> door<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.120> everything<00:05:09.389> over

in the front door and everything over

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.050 
in the front door and everything over
here<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:09.990> because<00:05:10.199> I<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:11.669> was<00:05:11.789> kind<00:05:12.000> of

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
here just because I it was kind of

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.730 
here just because I it was kind of
pointless<00:05:12.449> by<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.900> time<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.139> got<00:05:13.379> done<00:05:13.590> with

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
pointless by the time I got done with

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.860 
pointless by the time I got done with
this<00:05:13.949> so<00:05:14.279> you<00:05:15.120> know<00:05:15.210> hopefully<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.629> guys
