00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.880
 eights fantasy spot 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.680
 let's learn how to make this sample 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.260
 so pretty 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.810
 in which we are going to apply for example in 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 a sweater in the middle of the sweater let's say 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.869
 what can the neck do instead of there 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.530
 down the fantasy of the eights 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.550
 surrounded 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.770
 from the point of the edge that is at a point 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.120
 moss point santa clara 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.930
 with a line 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 that is going to frame all eight the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.469
 stitch is very easy it is repeated 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.829
 constantly to get the 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:57.449
 design is complete this sample is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.449
 made with 22 points is not reversible 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.180
 it only comes out on the right side 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.800
 here I did all these races the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.159
 go ahead so they can see how it's going 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.399
 staying 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.990
 this sample I have it separated with some 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.500
 black rings 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.810
 so that they see that it is always repeated 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.619
 in the last six points and the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.250
 first six points that are always in 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.190
 the clear holy point or stupid point or 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.410
 moss point for 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.450
 that will not be confused with the rest 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.400
 of the stitch we're going to start doing it 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 so they can see how it is 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.079
 easy the first race 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.409
 it is targeted consists of four races 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:54.229
 the first race we do the six 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:58.140
 points at the right point all 62 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 the first points are always made 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.990
 the sample six rights six rights 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.570
 on the contrary for the right always 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.259
 does exactly the same then so that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.530
 there's no confusion that's why I put 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.140
 the ring below we make a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.880
 straight 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:25.790
 we are on the right side of the fabric 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:29.720
 we make a right three backwards 123 points 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.990
 in reverse point then we make a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.940
 right a loop from left to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:41.410
 right another right and again those 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.900
 three points upside down 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.640
 same here 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.209
 a point to the right just like here 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.319
 we passed the ring and our six 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.560
 points in public santaclara point or 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.620
 bobo as you want to call the whole is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.930
 that these are the points in point 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 right that was our first race 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.640
 we go for the second 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.519
 with which we started it as I told you 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.560
 with the six points in right point 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:22.690
 so they can see how easy it is 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.780
 4 5 and 6 we passed our ring that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.850
 we must do here a point backwards 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.170
 three points to the right and from there they go 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.900
 leaving three points to the right 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.660
 we get to the middle of 8 and we make three 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.690
 points in reverse point 1 2 and 3 3 points 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.170
 in reverse point then then as 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.300
 you are presenting a right two 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.520
 rights three rights one point backwards 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 we passed our ring and we finished 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.130
 our design with that with six points 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.130
 in a right point two 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.280
 4 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.280
 5 and 6 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.709
 let's go to the third race 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.639
 and we started like all the other two with 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.210
 six points at a right point 1 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 two 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 3. 4 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.080
 5 and 6 we passed the ring remember 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.240
 we are going in the third race 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.800
 then we make a right 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.490
 three points in a reverse point one two 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.759
 three points has a reverse point after 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.030
 that is, we are already at the center of 8 that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:05:00.910
 we make in that center we weave in point 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:05.470
 right 3 points 1 2 and 3 below 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.780
 the first point of these 3 we had 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.780
 above the other two 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.730
 and let go more that does not close is like the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.860
 little head of 8 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.560
 that closes us on the 8th 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.349
 we make three points in right point 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.319
 we took the first point and passed it through 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.319
 on top of the other two below 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.680
 we do how to present three 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.909
 points on point back a point at 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.909
 right and 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.740
 the 6 points 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.650
 to the right 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.560
 to end 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.560
 race number 3 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.790
 we go to race number 4 and last 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.860
 where it is already done 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.560
 fantasy of eights that we are going to do in 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.990
 race number four first we're going to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.900
 do the six points that we already know if 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.380
 between always are the six at a point 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.380
 straight 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.820
 We pass the ring and we do as they go 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.820
 presenting a reverse 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.690
 one two three rights and this we are in 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.970
 the 8 in the middle of the milestones then 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.970
 that is done two points upside down 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:45.580
 and then a right two rights three 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.030
 rights as we have always done 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.030
 a reverse 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:56.450
 and then the six points in 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:00.320
 right point to finish our 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.650
 we're going to look at how this was 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.310
 eights fantasy 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.310
 all right 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.750
 this is the reverse of the sample 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:15.110
 this is the stitch right so 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:19.190
 our eights were perfectly 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.620
 aligned in marked 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.200
 for the rest of stitches as is left of 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.510
 nice if you have a doubt 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.850
 write tell me how did you think 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.980
 They thought it was very nice that 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.140
 applied if they had any difficulty 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.150
 register in the channel that we have 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.150
 many videos as beautiful as this one
