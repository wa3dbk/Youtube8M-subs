00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have a look how to craft these things so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
have a look how to craft these things so
in<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.379> chest<00:00:43.590> shows<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> craft

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
in this chest shows you how to craft

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.790 
in this chest shows you how to craft
them<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.969> brown<00:00:45.390> ones<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.690> different<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
them the brown ones are different to the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
them the brown ones are different to the
rest<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> color<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.120> reason<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
rest of the color of some reason so you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
rest of the color of some reason so you
get<00:00:48.930> sugar<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> way<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> outside

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
get sugar all the way around the outside

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.250 
get sugar all the way around the outside
with<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> cocoa<00:00:51.449> beans<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> middle<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
with a cocoa beans in the middle and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
with a cocoa beans in the middle and
you'll<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> brown<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you'll get a brown in there and then the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.569 
you'll get a brown in there and then the
other<00:00:54.809> ones<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.860> opposite<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.460> they

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
other ones have the opposite so they

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.010 
other ones have the opposite so they
have<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> sugar<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> middle<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> then

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have the sugar in the middle and then

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
have the sugar in the middle and then
the<00:00:58.379> dye<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> choice<00:00:59.219> around<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.609> outside<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the dye of choice around the outside so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
the dye of choice around the outside so
this<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> blue<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.530> lapis

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this one to make the blue one is lapis

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
this one to make the blue one is lapis
lazuli<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> blue<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.660> miR<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
lazuli and you get the blue and miR and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.850 
lazuli and you get the blue and miR and
then<00:01:04.619> you'll<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.270> replace<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.860> lapis

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
then you'll get if you replace the lapis

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
then you'll get if you replace the lapis
lazuli<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.580> any<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.119> dyes<00:01:09.390> will<00:01:09.630> get

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
lazuli with any of these dyes will get

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
lazuli with any of these dyes will get
the<00:01:10.049> corresponding<00:01:10.619> color<00:01:11.340> mm<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the corresponding color mm so that is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
the corresponding color mm so that is
the<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.590> members<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.820> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the way to get them members and then you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
the way to get them members and then you
get<00:01:15.450> pretty<00:01:15.960> much<00:01:16.110> eat<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.860> eat<00:01:17.159> them

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
get pretty much eat them so you eat them

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.770 
get pretty much eat them so you eat them
they<00:01:17.400> heal<00:01:17.790> three<00:01:18.150> hunger<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.659> also

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
