00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 

we're<00:00:00.510> going<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.690> be<00:00:00.810> talking<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.140> the

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
we're going to be talking about the

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.960 
we're going to be talking about the
difference<00:00:01.680> between<00:00:01.740> our<00:00:02.159> which<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.790> learned

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
difference between our which we learned

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.240 
difference between our which we learned
about<00:00:03.060> before<00:00:03.510> an<00:00:03.720> R<00:00:04.020> squared<00:00:06.770> so<00:00:07.770> first<00:00:08.010> I'm

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
about before an R squared so first I'm

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.009 
about before an R squared so first I'm
just<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.639> introduce<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> concept<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.780> R

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
just going to introduce the concept of R

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.950 
just going to introduce the concept of R
squared<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> why<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.950> need<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.880> understand<00:00:12.690> it

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
squared and why we need to understand it

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.289 
squared and why we need to understand it
why<00:00:13.469> can't<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.920> square<00:00:14.370> are<00:00:14.580> right<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
why can't we just square are right and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
why can't we just square are right and
be<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.599> haha<00:00:15.809> that's<00:00:16.289> R<00:00:16.470> squared<00:00:16.859> well<00:00:17.400> we

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
be like haha that's R squared well we

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.890 
be like haha that's R squared well we
want<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> know<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.029> meaning<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.690> R

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
want to know what the meaning of R

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.679 
want to know what the meaning of R
squared<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.590> right<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:21.150> order<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.449> get

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
squared is right and so in order to get

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.450 
squared is right and so in order to get
to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> meaning<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.350> R<00:00:22.529> squared<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to the meaning of R squared we have to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.040 
to the meaning of R squared we have to
understand<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.240> sum<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.720> squared

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
understand that sum of squared

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
understand that sum of squared
differences<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:26.279> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> split

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
differences is actually going to split

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.849 
differences is actually going to split
apart<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.779> different<00:00:28.019> ways<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.740> we're

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
apart in two different ways and so we're

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
apart in two different ways and so we're
going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> learn<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.460> parse<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
going to learn how to parse the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.240 
going to learn how to parse the
different<00:00:30.869> parts<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> sum<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> squared

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
different parts of the sum of squared

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.190 
different parts of the sum of squared
differences<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.690> we're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> talk

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
differences then we're going to talk

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
differences then we're going to talk
about<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.739> r<00:00:34.920> squared<00:00:35.340> means<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> very

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
about what r squared means for a very

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
about what r squared means for a very
strong<00:00:36.540> correlation<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> what<00:00:37.770> r<00:00:37.920> squared

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
strong correlation and what r squared

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.360 
strong correlation and what r squared
might<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> very<00:00:39.239> weak<00:00:39.450> correlation

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.310 

alright<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> reasons<00:00:46.050> why

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
alright so one of the reasons why

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
alright so one of the reasons why
practically<00:00:47.010> you'll<00:00:47.340> need<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> understand

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
practically you'll need to understand

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
practically you'll need to understand
what<00:00:48.239> r<00:00:48.390> squared<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.500> often<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
what r squared is is that often when you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
what r squared is is that often when you
do<00:00:50.480> when<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> regression<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
do when you do a regression on the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.090 
do when you do a regression on the
computer<00:00:53.520> either<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.239> SPSS<00:00:54.960> source<00:00:55.320> data<00:00:55.649> or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
computer either in SPSS source data or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.729 
computer either in SPSS source data or
any<00:00:56.370> any<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> those<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.750> statistics

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
any any of those like statistics

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.040 
any any of those like statistics
packages<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.760> will<00:00:59.910> often<00:01:00.149> give<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.840> r

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
packages they will often give you r

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
packages they will often give you r
squared<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.760> outputs<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
squared as one of the outputs right and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.149 
squared as one of the outputs right and
you<00:01:03.750> might<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.110> looking<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.860> why

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you might be looking at and be like why

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
you might be looking at and be like why
are<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.460> giving<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.970> r<00:01:06.180> squared<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.130> we

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
are they giving me r squared and so we

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.060 
are they giving me r squared and so we
want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> meaning<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
want to know what is the meaning of it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
want to know what is the meaning of it
why<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.280> R<00:01:11.700> squared<00:01:11.729> why<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.840> our

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
why is R squared why not just have our

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
why is R squared why not just have our
right<00:01:13.770> often<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.330> find<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
right often if you just find the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.710 
right often if you just find the
correlation<00:01:16.500> you'll<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.490> our<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.479> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
correlation you'll just get our but if

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
correlation you'll just get our but if
you<00:01:18.930> find<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> regression<00:01:19.770> you'll<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.340> R

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you find the regression you'll get R

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.240 
you find the regression you'll get R
squared<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.740> what's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
squared right so it's like what what's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
squared right so it's like what what's
the<00:01:23.400> deal<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.720> r<00:01:25.409> squared<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the deal right and and r squared really

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
the deal right and and r squared really
is<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.400> R<00:01:26.880> squared<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:29.090> but<00:01:30.090> there's<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is just R squared right but there's a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
is just R squared right but there's a
meaning<00:01:30.780> behind<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> just

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
meaning behind it and I want to just

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
meaning behind it and I want to just
stop<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> moment<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.079> say<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.740> sort

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
stop for a moment and say well it's sort

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
stop for a moment and say well it's sort
of<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> difference<00:01:35.820> between<00:01:35.970> feet<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of like the difference between feet and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
of like the difference between feet and
feet<00:01:37.439> squared<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.759> mean<00:01:39.180> different<00:01:39.210> things

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
feet squared they mean different things

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.940 
feet squared they mean different things
it's<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.790> could<00:01:41.970> square

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's it's not just that you could square

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
it's it's not just that you could square
the<00:01:43.950> number<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.970> well<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the number and be like well it's just

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
the number and be like well it's just
the<00:01:45.689> number<00:01:46.079> squared<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the number squared right it's not just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
the number squared right it's not just
about<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.509> number<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.200> also<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
about the number it's also about the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
about the number it's also about the
actual<00:01:50.460> unit<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.420> understand<00:01:51.899> what

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
actual unit you have to understand what

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
actual unit you have to understand what
the<00:01:52.290> unit<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.460> feet<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the unit is because feet is a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.679 
the unit is because feet is a
measurement<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:56.240> examines<00:01:57.240> length

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
measurement that just examines length

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:06.310 
measurement that just examines length
right<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:59.159> square<00:01:59.880> feet<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:01.740> gives<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:03.469> area

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
right but square feet now gives you area

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
right but square feet now gives you area
right<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> those<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.280> different<00:02:09.209> things

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
right and those are different things

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
right and those are different things
they're<00:02:09.989> obviously<00:02:10.289> related<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.190> each<00:02:11.280> other

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
they're obviously related to each other

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.340 
they're obviously related to each other
but<00:02:12.000> they're<00:02:12.390> very<00:02:12.450> different<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
but they're very different I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.770 
but they're very different I
Diaz<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.310> because<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.300> need<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
Diaz and so because of that you need to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.080 
Diaz and so because of that you need to
also<00:02:15.960> not<00:02:16.440> only<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.310> how<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.550> calculate

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
also not only know like how to calculate

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.590 
also not only know like how to calculate
R<00:02:18.420> squared<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.410> also<00:02:19.620> know<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.880> meaning<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.420> R

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
R squared but also know the meaning of R

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.930 
R squared but also know the meaning of R
squared
