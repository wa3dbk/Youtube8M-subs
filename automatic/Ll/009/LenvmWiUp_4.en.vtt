00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the top plate with a sock and it was

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
the top plate with a sock and it was
pretty<00:00:12.420> cool<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.170> had<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> talk<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.769> the

pretty cool but I had to talk with the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.070 
pretty cool but I had to talk with the
guys<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.370> Global<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.759> said<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.269> we

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
guys at Global and said you know what we

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.810 
guys at Global and said you know what we
really<00:00:16.109> don't<00:00:16.470> need<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.770> big<00:00:17.010> 30<00:00:17.220> by<00:00:17.400> 30<00:00:17.520> base

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
really don't need this big 30 by 30 base

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
really don't need this big 30 by 30 base
plate<00:00:18.119> number<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.250> expensive<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.430> what

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
plate number one is expensive for what

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.070 
plate number one is expensive for what
we're<00:00:20.699> building<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.029> number<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.840> it's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
we're building here number two it's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189 
we're building here number two it's
heavy<00:00:22.320> number<00:00:23.010> three<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:23.640> bulky<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:25.080> need

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
heavy number three it's bulky we need

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.050 
heavy number three it's bulky we need
something<00:00:25.470> smaller<00:00:25.980> lighter<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.699> less

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
something smaller lighter and less

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.169 
something smaller lighter and less
expensive<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.439> developed<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.429> check

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
expensive so they developed this check

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.440 
expensive so they developed this check
it<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.869> 20<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:31.560> 20<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:32.099> base<00:00:33.090> plate

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it out this is a 20 by 20 a base plate

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
it out this is a 20 by 20 a base plate
from<00:00:34.079> global<00:00:34.469> trust<00:00:34.860> America<00:00:35.309> GTA<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.210> weighs

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
from global trust America GTA it weighs

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
from global trust America GTA it weighs
13<00:00:37.649> pounds<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> old<00:00:39.120> base<00:00:39.390> plate<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:40.100> big

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
13 pounds now the old base plate is big

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
13 pounds now the old base plate is big
it's<00:00:41.570> 30<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.750> 30<00:00:43.020> aluminum<00:00:43.829> 35<00:00:44.520> pounds<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it's 30 by 30 aluminum 35 pounds and you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
it's 30 by 30 aluminum 35 pounds and you
know<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:46.860> than<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.520> had

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
know what it's better than what we had

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.139 
know what it's better than what we had
before<00:00:47.870> we<00:00:48.870> had<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.559> huge<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.280> iron

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
before we had before was huge like iron

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540 
before we had before was huge like iron
stuff<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> aluminum<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.920> very<00:00:53.129> welcome

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
stuff so the aluminum was very welcome

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
stuff so the aluminum was very welcome
but<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.449> purposes<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> smaller

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
but for our purposes for the smaller

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
but for our purposes for the smaller
stuff<00:00:55.770> yeah<00:00:56.760> check<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.420> doesn't<00:00:58.230> weigh

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
stuff yeah check it out doesn't weigh

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
stuff yeah check it out doesn't weigh
anything<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> size<00:00:59.309> difference<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
anything what a size difference what a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
anything what a size difference what a
weight<00:01:00.719> difference<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.949> definitely

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
weight difference and there's definitely

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.299 
weight difference and there's definitely
a<00:01:02.609> price<00:01:03.000> difference<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:05.250> do

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
a price difference as well and what do

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
a price difference as well and what do
you<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> plate<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.140> works

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you use a plate like this for it works

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.120 
you use a plate like this for it works
as<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> base<00:01:08.310> plate<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.970> f24<00:01:09.780> trust<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
as a base plate for f24 trust which is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
as a base plate for f24 trust which is
the<00:01:11.790> smaller<00:01:12.210> stress<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.930> we're<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the smaller stress here we're going to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
the smaller stress here we're going to
do<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> project<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.040> real<00:01:14.909> soon<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.600> stay

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
do a project with this real soon so stay

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
do a project with this real soon so stay
tuned<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.799> partisan<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tuned for that just got my partisan that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
tuned for that just got my partisan that
I<00:01:17.790> needed<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> finish<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.509> project<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.799> also

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I needed to finish my project it also

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
I needed to finish my project it also
worked<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> top<00:01:21.060> plate<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> big<00:01:21.900> f<00:01:22.140> 44

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
worked as a top plate for the big f 44

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.820 
worked as a top plate for the big f 44
truss<00:01:23.070> most<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> us<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.840> most<00:01:25.710> of
