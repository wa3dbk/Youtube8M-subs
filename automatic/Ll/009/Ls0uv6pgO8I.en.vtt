00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.749
 hello youtube people 

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:05.150
 today I bring you an analysis I tell about the game 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.519
 star wars the power of the force of ps2 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.719
 this game is great 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 If you are a 'Star Wars' fan then do not miss this great game 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.460
 I have reached the final twice and have two different finals 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.880
 I would tell you but better game on it and find out for yourself the game 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.169
 it starts in that you are darth vader 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.199
 and you fight with a yacarÃ© 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.339
 after killing that yeda and you train your son 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.250
 that then that guy will be great and use that character throughout 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.140
 game 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.600
 then you go up levels 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.230
 you can reinforce t 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810
 change your clothes 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.180
 etc 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.600
 as its own name indicates the power of force reimagines the reach and the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.100
 magnitude of the force taking full advantage of the most current 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.220
 developed technologies to create a game that is made possible thanks to the 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.250
 new generation of consoles 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 dmm incorporates the physical properties that any object should have in its 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.540
 usual means in order that everything reacts in the most realistic way 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.000
 possible the wood is broken as if wood were treated glass like glass 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.950
 the plants of the planet faith were curved like true plants of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 Planet Faith looked and much more 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.450
 on the other hand thanks to a revolutionary simulation engine of the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 movement the interactive characters can move act in even think 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.320
 as true human beings adapting their behavior on the fly and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 resulting in a different result depending on the situation 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 well I do not have anything else to say 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 I give this game a ten because it's great 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.810

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 here I leave some images to cole that see how is the game 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.400
 over when you're gaining experience 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.750
 your character becomes stronger 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.070
 And the end 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.150
 well I can not stand ha ha 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.250
 I'll just tell you that you have to fight against Darth Vader 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.070
 the rest discover what yourselves 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.790
 there are two endings as I said before 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 the bad end 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.849
 and the good ending 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.149
