00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
effectively and that that seemed to be a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.819 
effectively and that that seemed to be a
key<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.420> side<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.440> he<00:00:49.530> looked<00:00:49.739> at

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
key on the other side and he looked at

just<00:00:52.320> feel<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> get

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
just feel right and I think when you get

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
just feel right and I think when you get
to<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> bottom<00:00:54.570> line<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.680> mission<00:00:56.129> he<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to the bottom line this mission he is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
to the bottom line this mission he is
flying<00:00:56.640> very<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> seat<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> his

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
flying very much by the seat of his
pants<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> feels<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.070> he'll<00:00:59.609> go

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
pants when it feels right he'll go

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
pants when it feels right he'll go
if<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.690> speed<00:01:01.050> feels<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.399> he'll

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
if the speed feels like it's there he'll

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.060 
if the speed feels like it's there he'll
make<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> assault<00:01:03.690> forget<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> angles

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
make the assault forget all the angles

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
make the assault forget all the angles

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
when it feels right is when Robbie

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
when it feels right is when Robbie
Knievel<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.790> he's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Knievel is going to do it and if he's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
Knievel is going to do it and if he's
flying<00:01:15.299> accurately<00:01:16.080> by<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> seat<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.619> the
