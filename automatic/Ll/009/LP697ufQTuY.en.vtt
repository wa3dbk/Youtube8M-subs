00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.840
 welcome to the channel today I come with a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.360
 lesson is a video of clans that is going to 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.669
 be very short and good is that it is a 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.550
 discovery that I do well like that so in 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.359
 direct desire as I will record it but 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 already so if you want to see if you like them 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.890
 my lips and if you want to see the worst that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.570
 I have found that it is rather a mixture 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.970
 but hey it 's a little bit of everything 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.610
 he knows the video very easy very easy 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.449
 very easy here I come with a clone I hope 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.220
 that you like the lipstick that already today because 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.430
 Today of course a very nice fuchsia over 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.460
 limited edition that is very very difficult 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.970
 of getting it from the school of the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.760
 cole one of those from rihanna that good since 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.510
 you know what has had multiple of the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 rival love summer to autumn 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.330
 and what else is the player pong of mac 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.300
 matte texture 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.400
 fuchsia 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.420
 it seems super flattering to me 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 any girl I personally am very 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
 functions and red I find a color 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.680
 super nice 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 I 'm going to leave it up, the problem is 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.610
 which is a collection to compare and in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.010
 special my tuna how complicated it is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.890
 get hold of him 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.330
 then I took the clones video 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.010
 number 2 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:51.990
 volume 2 in this clone that is one of 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.730
 called bondi 410 by calvin klein 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.920
 what it looks like 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.100
 and the work is more more brilliant vinyl 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.470
 is not it wonderful 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.800
 but of course it's less matte like the one 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.800
 He says 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.110
 this is the motto always keep it in mind 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.200
 this is a motto 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.250
 the one above would be the then good 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.830
 I'm going to give you a clone 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.360
 what 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.580
 really 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.250
 I tell you what I do is very many 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.800
 cars a lot of tests because of course 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 a video of plans is not removed without genius 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.020
 of the anh of the day so to the brave 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.090
 so easily then I go testing or 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.520
 doing things looking at one watching the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.620
 another then I've been testing 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.290
 testing and suddenly said come and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.890
 mixed this with this happening that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.900
 happens 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.330
 because we take out the pressure then 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.890
 I hope there is luck and that you have them 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.990
 because they are very good lipsticks 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.819
 famous others so there we go for 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.940
 please please I hope you have it already 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.190
 so important the order I have seen then 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.270
 we started as a base we would have to use 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.870
 the russian red that is a matte lipstick 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.379
 mch 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.379
 do not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.160
 is the one before rugby really this 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.180
 it is matter 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.859
 retro mate is much 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.670
 we see it very red and it makes both 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.329
 fuchsia then good I'll put it in 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.329
 My little hand 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.910
 here you see how good this has 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.200
 lip is that although it is matte is enough 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.210
 less strong than the blond room and it's so 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.590
 dry that you can do barcode 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.170
 of everything and is very heavy 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.090
 and with wants to mix 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.470
 the russian to get the tree 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.050
 when you see it 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.220
 this is the Miss Misses that 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.190
 is that it looks like the can and the 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.380
 union a lipstick that came out in collection 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.240
 of marc 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 it was very complicated to get it and now 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.010
 has already remained in fixed linear that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:14.500
 it's usually sold out here 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:18.300
 you have the pink fluorescent juniors lamp and what 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.300
 I'm going to apply over 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.350
 so you can see 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.610
 how do we have the sermon 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.509
 neither more nor less I'm going to do the 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.900
 It goes well and also as in the two 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:41.720
 they are matt the result is mate 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.670
 well here you have it this is the mix 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.040
 this already to your liking if you want it 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.540
 more fuchsia you put more candy for example 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.520
 right now I put a little more 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.220
 from the friend that you have a little more 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.160

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.350

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.759
 I'm in the dressing room and with the air because 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.759
 if there were no times I lost lighting 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.789
