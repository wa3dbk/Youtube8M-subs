 [musics] 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:39.850
 For N everyone's Hello Imai JunTaro This time, all low ball 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.850
 a I want to meet you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 For example 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.100
 The wind is growing up or 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.079
 There is no distance but a little narrow 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.719
 Keep it low at such times 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:59.769
 There is not much distance, but it is low and how to capture the fairway surely dark 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.769
 It means that you should do it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.950
 Time and location First of all learn it is natural there was low when the tea up its 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.230
 p 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.230
 From 2 o'clock 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.670
 Lower 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.670
 And the ball position is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.230
 Than usual 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.230
 There is a picker 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.659
 peach 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.229
 Put inside 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.380
 Grip also falls a little short 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.130
 You take care'm less open this three-point 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.530
 The ball 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.880
 Ward to listen to and TEAC on the right foot closer to the little lieutenant general 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.960
 Close to clothes 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 Be careful with the swing 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 I take care of things like that follow Mr. fattening studying in naturally low 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.689
 I think I want to do one in it 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.220
 Hold the grip short 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.450
 Then take the ball and put it on the right foot 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.250
 From this situation 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.300
 The rest of the agricultural machinery section 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.740
 There 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.740
 I am 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 voodoo 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410
 Hmm 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 I feel like this 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.140
 That place I do not sleep 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.540
 In front 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.540
 It is the left end of the function to the right 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.850
 Short holding key low tee up 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:37.410
 And a little of the ball in the right foot closer 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.410
 Once you have their does it swing from the course, but reduce the follow 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.590
 It feels like
