if i had put in some more effort i would

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
if i had put in some more effort i would
have<00:01:01.170> gotten<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.980> year<00:01:02.309> super<00:01:03.210> easy<00:01:03.420> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have gotten an a all year super easy but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
i did pass the state test or the sol you

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.399 
i did pass the state test or the sol you
guys<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.659> hear<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:06.900> say<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> word<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.380> lot

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
guys will hear me say that word a lot

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.560 
guys will hear me say that word a lot
because<00:01:07.860> sol<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> virginia<00:01:09.360> state

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because sol is like the virginia state

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.530 
because sol is like the virginia state
test<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.340> passed<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> SOL<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> good

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
with a be for the year which is also a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.600 
with a be for the year which is also a
plus<00:01:17.369> plus<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.920> yeah<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> class<00:01:20.280> wasn't

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
plus plus and so yeah that class wasn't

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.070 
plus plus and so yeah that class wasn't
very<00:01:20.880> difficult<00:01:21.360> everybody<00:01:21.689> said<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.990> would

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
very difficult everybody said that would

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
very difficult everybody said that would
be<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.350> easy<00:01:22.470> class<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.280> our<00:01:23.610> sign<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
be really easy class and our sign is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.370 
be really easy class and our sign is
really<00:01:24.180> easy<00:01:24.299> anyway<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.080> stuff<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
really easy anyway it's just stuff like

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
really easy anyway it's just stuff like
rocks<00:01:25.860> minerals<00:01:27.619> geology<00:01:29.180> oceanography<00:01:30.180> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
rocks minerals geology oceanography like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
rocks minerals geology oceanography like
all<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> stuff<00:01:30.840> mix<00:01:31.140> together<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
all that stuff mix together and so it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
all that stuff mix together and so it's
really<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.909> difficult<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.710> next<00:01:34.710> year

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
really not that difficult and next year

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.660 
really not that difficult and next year
I'm<00:01:35.009> probably<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> take

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
I'm probably just going to take

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
I'm probably just going to take
oceanography<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.140> branch<00:01:37.710> off<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> earth

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
oceanography so a branch off of earth

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
oceanography so a branch off of earth
science<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.780> should<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.990> pretty<00:01:40.110> easy<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
science and it should be pretty easy as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.690 
science and it should be pretty easy as
well<00:01:40.680> hopefully<00:01:40.890> I'll<00:01:41.009> pay<00:01:41.189> attention<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> lot

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
well hopefully I'll pay attention a lot

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.440 
well hopefully I'll pay attention a lot
more<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.090> do

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
more than I do

insignificant<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.689> class<00:01:54.929> was<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.920> know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

I<00:01:56.549> don't<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:57.000> history<00:01:57.420> class<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.960> since<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I don't like history class but since I

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
I don't like history class but since I
do<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:58.679> well<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.429> like<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
do very well in it I like it if that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450 
do very well in it I like it if that
makes<00:02:00.420> sense<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> don't<00:02:01.619> enjoy<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
makes sense like I don't enjoy going to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.990 
makes sense like I don't enjoy going to
that<00:02:02.670> class<00:02:02.819> but<00:02:03.210> since<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.509> well<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.850> not

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
a bad class to me so I passed with an a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.390 
a bad class to me so I passed with an a
well<00:02:09.149> almost<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.840> A<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.289> year<00:02:10.530> don't<00:02:11.310> even

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
well almost an A for the year don't even

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
well almost an A for the year don't even
get<00:02:11.549> me<00:02:11.610> started<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.599> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
get me started about this because I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.449 
get me started about this because I
literally<00:02:13.200> had<00:02:13.680> an<00:02:13.830> eighty-nine<00:02:14.430> percent

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
literally had an eighty-nine percent

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.550 
literally had an eighty-nine percent
which<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.360> my<00:02:15.959> County<00:02:16.440> 89<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.380> highest

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
which in my County 89 is of the highest

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
which in my County 89 is of the highest
be<00:02:19.920> plus<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.640> right<00:02:20.880> before<00:02:21.030> an<00:02:21.239> A

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
be plus you can get right before an A

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.500 
be plus you can get right before an A
which<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> 90<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.530> above<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> had<00:02:24.090> an<00:02:24.150> 89

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
which is a 90 and above so I had an 89

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
which is a 90 and above so I had an 89
for<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.810> year<00:02:25.310> one<00:02:26.310> percent<00:02:26.760> away<00:02:27.000> from

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
for the year one percent away from

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.220 
for the year one percent away from
making<00:02:27.269> an<00:02:27.420> eighth<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> year<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.079> when<00:02:28.200> I

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
making an eighth of the year but when I

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.020 
making an eighth of the year but when I
got<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.440> talk<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.799> because<00:02:29.099> it's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
got to talk about it because it's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.930 
got to talk about it because it's
whatever<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.829> then<00:02:31.829> for<00:02:32.370> fourth<00:02:32.640> period

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
research paper which I got a almost one

research paper which I got a almost one
hundred<00:03:37.829> percent<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.370> which<00:03:38.579> is<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:38.880> good

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
hundred percent on which is really good

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.699 
hundred percent on which is really good
