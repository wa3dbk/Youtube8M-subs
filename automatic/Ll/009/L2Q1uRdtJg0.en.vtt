00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.660 
finger coiling now I just do this
throughout<00:02:10.690> my<00:02:10.810> head<00:02:11.380> throughout<00:02:12.250> my<00:02:12.430> head

throughout my head throughout my head
lightly<00:02:14.760> until<00:02:15.760> I've<00:02:16.300> done<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.050> all<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
lightly until I've done it on all the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.699 
lightly until I've done it on all the
sections<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.610> what<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.540> do<00:02:19.690> after<00:02:20.080> finger

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
sections and what I do after finger

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.930 
sections and what I do after finger
coiling<00:02:21.069> is<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:21.760> lightly<00:02:22.739> scrunch<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.580> ends

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
coiling is just lightly scrunch the ends

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.660 
coiling is just lightly scrunch the ends
of<00:02:25.030> my<00:02:25.060> hair<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:32.530> continue<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.340> process

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
of my hair now continue this process

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.590 
of my hair now continue this process
over<00:02:34.299> my<00:02:34.660> entire<00:02:34.989> head<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.880> focus<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.299> lot<00:02:37.480> of

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
over my entire head and I focus a lot of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.870 
over my entire head and I focus a lot of
attention<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.860> front<00:02:39.190> section<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.730> my

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
attention on the front section of my

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.000 
attention on the front section of my
hair<00:02:40.150> because<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.870> has<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.350> looser<00:02:41.739> curl

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
hair because it has the looser curl

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.570 
hair because it has the looser curl
pattern<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:44.340> make<00:02:45.340> sure

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
pattern so I have to really make sure

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.910 
pattern so I have to really make sure
that<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:45.970> completely<00:02:46.330> cools<00:02:46.989> up<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.590> scrunch

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that it completely cools up and scrunch

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.370 
that it completely cools up and scrunch
it<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.670> know<00:02:48.819> until<00:02:49.330> my<00:02:49.390> heart's<00:02:49.750> desire<00:02:49.930> to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
it you know until my heart's desire to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.370 
it you know until my heart's desire to
make<00:02:50.560> sure<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.069> curl<00:02:51.280> forms<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.110> here's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
make sure that the curl forms so here's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.530 
make sure that the curl forms so here's
what<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:53.709> head<00:02:54.010> looks<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.459> when<00:02:54.940> all<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
what my head looks like when all of the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.350 
what my head looks like when all of the
cools<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:57.849> let<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.239> dry

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
cools are in it and then I let it dry

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.460 
cools are in it and then I let it dry
for<00:02:58.870> about<00:02:58.959> an<00:02:59.080> hour<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.860> half<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.989> my

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
for about an hour and a half here my

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.729 
for about an hour and a half here my
hair<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.769> about<00:03:03.069> ninety<00:03:03.910> percent<00:03:04.269> dry<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.230> at

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
this is after I've completed my entire

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.030 
this is after I've completed my entire
head<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.750> there's<00:03:56.109> tons<00:03:56.709> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
head you can see that there's tons of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.940 
head you can see that there's tons of
volume<00:03:57.549> now<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.049> know<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.470> process

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
volume now and so you know the process

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.160 
volume now and so you know the process
of<00:04:00.190> pulling<00:04:00.639> apart<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.209> cools<00:04:01.569> takes<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
of pulling apart the cools takes the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.470 
of pulling apart the cools takes the
longest<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:03.010> think<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.549> it's<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.329> know

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
longest you think that it's you know

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.440 
longest you think that it's you know
putting<00:04:04.780> them<00:04:05.019> in<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.620> really<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.280> me<00:04:06.459> it

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
putting them in but really for me it

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
putting them in but really for me it
takes<00:04:07.690> longest<00:04:08.199> to<00:04:08.380> pull<00:04:08.560> them<00:04:08.650> apart<00:04:08.729> now<00:04:09.729> I'm

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
takes longest to pull them apart now I'm

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.640 
takes longest to pull them apart now I'm
just<00:04:10.000> going<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.180> use<00:04:10.389> my<00:04:10.600> diffuser<00:04:11.229> to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
just going to use my diffuser to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.920 
just going to use my diffuser to
finished<00:04:12.980> dry<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.489> get<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:13.819> also<00:04:14.269> lifting<00:04:14.780> my

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
finished dry and get and also lifting my

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.150 
finished dry and get and also lifting my
roots<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.500> add<00:04:15.650> even<00:04:15.950> more<00:04:16.239> volume<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.269> my<00:04:17.540> hair

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
roots to add even more volume to my hair

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.580 
roots to add even more volume to my hair
and<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.280> believe<00:04:19.609> my<00:04:19.910> dryer<00:04:20.269> was<00:04:20.570> set<00:04:20.900> on<00:04:21.199> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
and I believe my dryer was set on the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.260 
and I believe my dryer was set on the
warm<00:04:21.859> setting<00:04:22.400> high<00:04:22.820> speeds<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:26.030> you're<00:04:26.150> just

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
warm setting high speeds so you're just
