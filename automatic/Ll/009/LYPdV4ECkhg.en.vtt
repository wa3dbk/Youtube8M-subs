that sets the pressure the boat we are

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.890 
that sets the pressure the boat we are
pumping<00:01:27.590> need<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.070> 0.25<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.570> set<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
pumping need to go to 0.25 you set the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.810 
pumping need to go to 0.25 you set the
pressure<00:01:30.110> by<00:01:30.320> twiddling<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.830> dial<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.790> the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
pressure by twiddling the dial to the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.590 
pressure by twiddling the dial to the
right<00:01:32.090> point

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.350 

we<00:01:38.110> will<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:38.320> demonstrate<00:01:38.729> inflating<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.909> two

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
we will now demonstrate inflating a two

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360 
we will now demonstrate inflating a two
point<00:01:40.600> three<00:01:40.780> meter<00:01:41.050> dinghy<00:01:41.290> as<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:42.070> would<00:01:42.220> be

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
point three meter dinghy as it would be

00:01:42.370 --> 00:02:39.890 
point three meter dinghy as it would be
unrolled<00:01:42.760> totally<00:01:43.390> deflated

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.040 

so<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.819> takes<00:02:43.090> three<00:02:43.390> three

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so as you can see it takes three three

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.990 
so as you can see it takes three three
minutes<00:02:44.349> 30<00:02:44.620> seconds<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.190> pump<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.790> two

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
minutes 30 seconds to pump up this two

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.030 
minutes 30 seconds to pump up this two
point<00:02:46.300> three<00:02:46.450> meter<00:02:46.720> dingy<00:02:46.989> pumping<00:02:47.830> at<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
point three meter dingy pumping at a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.309 
point three meter dingy pumping at a
maximum<00:02:48.400> rate<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.760> 160<00:02:49.599> liters<00:02:49.900> per<00:02:50.050> minute

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
maximum rate of 160 liters per minute

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.990 
maximum rate of 160 liters per minute
when<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.890> pump<00:02:51.099> gets<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.519> right<00:02:51.700> pressure

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
when the pump gets to the right pressure

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.559 
when the pump gets to the right pressure
it<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.840> cuts<00:02:53.080> out
