that<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.720> area<00:01:47.000> now<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.810> guess

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that little area now I have that I guess

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.539 
that little area now I have that I guess
I'm<00:01:49.890> supposed<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.689> twist<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.189> tuck<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'm supposed to twist and then tuck the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.889 
I'm supposed to twist and then tuck the
little<00:01:53.820> end<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.820> elasticy<00:01:57.630> thingy

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
little end in the little elasticy thingy

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.200 
little end in the little elasticy thingy
so<00:01:59.270> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.540> such<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.759> beautiful<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.149> me

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so this is such a beautiful look for me

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
so this is such a beautiful look for me
and<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> lot<00:02:04.229> lighter<00:02:04.560> than

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and this is actually a lot lighter than

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.800 
and this is actually a lot lighter than
like<00:02:05.100> our<00:02:05.280> regular<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.790> tell<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.509> twist

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.370 
sticking out so her and I are twins I
think<00:02:16.900> I'm<00:02:17.020> actually<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:18.160> ahead<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
think I'm actually going to go ahead and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.199 
think I'm actually going to go ahead and
get<00:02:20.380> dressed<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.400> might<00:02:21.550> actually<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:21.970> my

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
get dressed and I might actually do my

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.680 
get dressed and I might actually do my
makeup<00:02:22.450> before<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.200> my<00:02:23.440> hair<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.730> says<00:02:25.420> it's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
makeup before I do my hair it says it's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
makeup before I do my hair it says it's
supposed<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:27.180> help<00:02:28.180> reduce<00:02:29.130> drying<00:02:30.130> time<00:02:30.459> but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
supposed to help reduce drying time but

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.979 
supposed to help reduce drying time but
that's<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:30.970> because<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.300> tells<00:02:31.510> absorbing

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
that's just because it tells absorbing

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's just because it tells absorbing
some<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.200> your<00:02:32.319> water<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.860> yeah<00:02:33.489> I'll<00:02:33.670> check

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
some of your water so yeah I'll check

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.040 
some of your water so yeah I'll check
back<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.180> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.420> after<00:02:34.630> I've<00:02:34.840> gotten

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
back in a little bit after I've gotten

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.540 
back in a little bit after I've gotten
dressed<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> such<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.069> we'll<00:02:36.280> take<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
dressed and such and we'll take the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.250 
dressed and such and we'll take the
Turbie<00:02:36.790> twist<00:02:36.819> out<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.270> then<00:02:37.540> style<00:02:37.840> our<00:02:38.080> hair

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
Turbie twist out and then style our hair

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.979 
Turbie twist out and then style our hair
but<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.850> actually<00:02:39.850> is<00:02:40.030> holding<00:02:40.420> pretty<00:02:40.750> well

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
but that actually is holding pretty well

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.979 
but that actually is holding pretty well
so<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.620> don't<00:02:41.800> feel<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.459> gonna<00:02:43.390> move<00:02:43.690> at

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
let's take it out and just kind of peek

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.449 
let's take it out and just kind of peek
how<00:02:55.660> dry<00:02:55.900> my<00:02:55.930> hair<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.160> towel

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
how dry my hair is and the towel

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.449 
how dry my hair is and the towel
certainly<00:02:58.090> feels<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.950> did<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.250> lot<00:03:00.430> of

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
certainly feels like it did a lot of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.740 
certainly feels like it did a lot of
absorbing<00:03:01.120> actually<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.660> feels<00:03:01.810> pretty<00:03:02.230> damp

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
absorbing actually it feels pretty damp

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.660 
absorbing actually it feels pretty damp
yeah<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.019> my<00:03:05.140> hair<00:03:05.350> feels<00:03:05.709> I'm<00:03:06.250> gonna<00:03:06.519> say

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
yeah so my hair feels I'm gonna say

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.059 
yeah so my hair feels I'm gonna say
maybe<00:03:06.850> even<00:03:09.840> feels<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.989> good<00:03:11.170> deal<00:03:11.380> drier<00:03:11.709> than

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
maybe even feels a good deal drier than

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.470 
maybe even feels a good deal drier than
it<00:03:12.220> was<00:03:12.370> certainly<00:03:12.790> when<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:12.970> put<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.390> there

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
it was certainly when I put it in there

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.860 
it was certainly when I put it in there
totally<00:03:13.900> wet<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.580> now<00:03:15.970> I'm<00:03:16.269> going<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.570> blow-dry

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
totally wet so now I'm going to blow-dry

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.250 
totally wet so now I'm going to blow-dry
it<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.549> see<00:03:18.549> how<00:03:19.480> quickly<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.870> blow<00:03:20.049> dries

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
it and see how quickly a blow dries

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.490 
it and see how quickly a blow dries
versus<00:03:20.680> normal<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.130> usually<00:03:21.459> takes<00:03:21.760> me<00:03:22.500> mmm

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
versus normal it usually takes me mmm

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
versus normal it usually takes me mmm
maybe<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.489> seven<00:03:24.820> or<00:03:24.880> eight<00:03:24.940> minutes<00:03:25.180> to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
maybe like seven or eight minutes to

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.449 
maybe like seven or eight minutes to
blow-dry<00:03:25.720> my<00:03:25.900> hair<00:03:26.049> not<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.560> super<00:03:26.980> long<00:03:27.130> time

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
blow-dry my hair not a super long time

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.599 
blow-dry my hair not a super long time
but<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.230> feels<00:03:29.440> nice<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:30.070> don't<00:03:30.340> feel<00:03:30.489> like

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
but yeah it feels nice I don't feel like

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.370 
but yeah it feels nice I don't feel like
it's<00:03:30.730> gonna<00:03:30.880> be<00:03:30.970> static<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.200> anything

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
it's gonna be static here or anything

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's gonna be static here or anything
like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.070> makes<00:03:33.250> any<00:03:33.310> sense<00:03:33.459> but

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
like that if that makes any sense but

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.880 
like that if that makes any sense but
yeah<00:03:34.359> like<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.570> said<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.900> towel<00:03:35.109> does<00:03:35.500> feel
