00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
young musicians over the years I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.130 
young musicians over the years I

from young musicians especially string

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
from young musicians especially string
players<00:00:43.079> who've<00:00:43.739> been<00:00:43.920> inspired<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.700> music

players who've been inspired by my music

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
players who've been inspired by my music
I<00:00:45.620> think<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.739> unique<00:00:47.039> approach<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I think my unique approach for the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
I think my unique approach for the
violin<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> especially<00:00:48.539> exciting<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.440> them

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
violin is especially exciting for them

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
violin is especially exciting for them
because<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> demonstrates<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.719> are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
because it demonstrates that there are

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
because it demonstrates that there are
other<00:00:51.960> possibilities<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:53.219> besides

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
other possibilities out there besides

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
other possibilities out there besides
classical<00:00:54.510> music<00:00:54.870> flowing<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
classical music flowing but a lot of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
classical music flowing but a lot of
music<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.309> involved<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.420> carrying<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
music you're involved in carrying the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 
music you're involved in carrying the
rhythm<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.770> song<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.489> what

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
rhythm for the song so that's what

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.830 
rhythm for the song so that's what
you're<00:01:02.789> doing<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
