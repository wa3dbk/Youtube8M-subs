 my name is jan hendrickx my wife 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.090
 Sonja and I feared for 20 years 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.090
 camara ponies 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.080
 the communal pony comes from ireland 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.690
 the west of the island that's the way it is 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.760
 called connemara the piece of book for 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.650
 These ponies have been around since 1923 circa 1960 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
 the first cameras came over 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.750
 continent then you can also that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.590
 connemara pony love to ride too 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.770
 drive etc 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.660
 The coni has a stick size to 1 48 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.460
 However, there are also larger which is 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.200
 but partly also highly desirable 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 we try here on the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.930
 order to breed in mars 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.820
 The pony can become third of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.580
 adult people so no 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.070
 Pure kids ponies the way you look at that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.110
 but is a very strong 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.110
 built pony with a beautiful 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.940
 Attached head is in the rectangle 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 there are many different colors 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.500
 The mold is the most to be seen 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300
 hawk or debug skins as you like 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.360
 Saying is very common meanwhile 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.810
 also many brown ponies and now and then 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.940
 you can see 15 km - or even 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.210
 wage color that's not on hendl 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.210
 chemistry 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.120
 that camara pony has a lot 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.030
 lovable character that is too 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.680
 very hardworking that is also very important 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.450
 just for the rider because he wants 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.400
 no small ponies have which therefore 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.360
 slips into different divisions 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.680
 can be used in sport we want to 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.050
 All things also a very good 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.300
 bring character into the breed 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 not only because we have a riding school 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.320
 but because it actually works for us 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 the most important criterion is the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.330
 slogan of the connemara pony breeder is 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.330
 ponies can do everything 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.580
 which could be seen very marathoners 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 Often in open stallation I find it 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.630
 also important to point out 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.860
 that you are very good as an assistant 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.290
 can be held 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.090
 it is a very safe pony so steps 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.080
 if you are on the road with it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.270
 you will notice that in Ireland in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.540
 There are many stones in the camera 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.510
 lie and there the pony has over 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.270
 Centuries learned very much 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.900
 sure-footed to move that from 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.360
 marathoni is for kids and teenagers 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.330
 adults equally suited to that 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.150
 is suitable for recreational riders because you 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.490
 an absolutely super pleasant safe 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.760
 Rode on the ground can have 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.530
 but it is equally good for the sport because 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.450
 so you really a lot 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.680
 powerful of him under the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 saddle has resp 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.950
 in front of the coach quite important that would like 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.959
 also stress that they are awesome 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.420
 spring pony cent who is a great 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.070
 gambling is because in any case 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.070
 with also on the right side 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.129
 Yes
