00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
because when it gets caught in the
zipper<00:03:32.930> then<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.610> so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
zipper then you have to like it is so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.970 
zipper then you have to like it is so
sort<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.120> gets<00:03:35.240> bad<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.020> don't<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.770> that's

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
sort of gets bad so I don't know that's

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.170 
sort of gets bad so I don't know that's
just<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.280> thing<00:03:37.520> that<00:03:37.550> gets<00:03:37.940> caught

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
just one thing that gets caught

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.750 
just one thing that gets caught
sometimes<00:03:38.680> on<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.800> inside<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.459> see<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
sometimes on the inside you can see it

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.000 
sometimes on the inside you can see it
says<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.209> case<00:03:41.420> it's<00:03:41.690> also<00:03:41.870> very<00:03:42.200> soft<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
says in case it's also very soft on the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.680 
says in case it's also very soft on the
inside<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:43.610> it's<00:03:43.730> really<00:03:43.970> nice<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.540> your

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
inside so it's really nice to have your

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.960 
inside so it's really nice to have your
laptop<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.320> there<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.430> see<00:03:46.550> there<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.850> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
laptop in there you can see there is the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.570 
laptop in there you can see there is the
macbook<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:47.920> look<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.100> front<00:03:49.340> though<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.459> do

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
macbook so look in the front though I do

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.180 
macbook so look in the front though I do
like<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.900> very<00:03:51.020> well<00:03:51.260> designed<00:03:51.440> because

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
like it is very well designed because

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.490 
like it is very well designed because
you<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:52.610> see<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.390> lot<00:03:53.570> normally<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:53.989> pencil

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
you can see that a lot normally a pencil

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.810 
you can see that a lot normally a pencil
wouldn't<00:03:54.739> fit<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.070> right<00:03:55.370> if<00:03:55.489> they<00:03:55.610> just

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
wouldn't fit in right if they just

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.550 
wouldn't fit in right if they just
sealed<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.270> off<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.170> they've<00:03:57.320> gone<00:03:57.500> through

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
sealed this off but they've gone through

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.350 
sealed this off but they've gone through
the<00:03:57.860> extra<00:03:58.100> design<00:03:58.280> work<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.910> make<00:03:59.030> sure<00:03:59.060> that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
the extra design work to make sure that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.699 
the extra design work to make sure that
the<00:03:59.450> pencil<00:03:59.630> can<00:03:59.959> slip<00:04:00.290> up

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the pencil can slip up

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.860 
the pencil can slip up
you<00:04:01.190> know<00:04:01.310> like<00:04:01.520> go<00:04:01.700> up<00:04:01.850> underneath<00:04:02.239> there<00:04:02.600> cuz

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
you know like go up underneath there cuz

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.140 
you know like go up underneath there cuz
this<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.230> all<00:04:03.410> kinds<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> room<00:04:03.950> in<00:04:04.100> here

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
this is like all kinds of room in here

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.250 
this is like all kinds of room in here
so<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.270> have<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.420> really<00:04:05.660> long<00:04:05.810> brand<00:04:06.170> new

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
so you have a really long brand new

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.770 
so you have a really long brand new
pencil<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.830> stick<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.160> in<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.580> go

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
pencil and you stick it in it can go

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.750 
pencil and you stick it in it can go
underneath<00:04:08.780> into<00:04:09.650> here<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:10.280> they<00:04:10.370> really<00:04:10.580> have

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
underneath into here so they really have

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.860 
underneath into here so they really have
thought<00:04:10.970> about<00:04:11.060> these<00:04:11.360> sort<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.570> design

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
thought about these sort of design

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.570 
thought about these sort of design
decisions<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:13.190> think<00:04:13.340> that's<00:04:13.459> really

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
decisions and I think that's really

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.130 
decisions and I think that's really
smart<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:14.300> is<00:04:14.420> really<00:04:14.540> good<00:04:14.750> for<00:04:14.870> storing

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
smart so this is really good for storing

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.229 
smart so this is really good for storing
pencils<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:16.070> don't<00:04:16.310> keep<00:04:16.640> headphones<00:04:17.030> and

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.610 
pencils and I don't keep headphones and

Amazon or something for 50 or $45 but my
main<00:05:27.430> complaints<00:05:27.910> are<00:05:28.030> with<00:05:28.120> my<00:05:28.240> particular

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
main complaints are with my particular

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.629 
main complaints are with my particular
solution<00:05:29.200> except<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.979> think<00:05:30.190> about<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.550> you

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
solution except to think about it you

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.500 
solution except to think about it you
can<00:05:30.760> be<00:05:30.820> putting<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.120> into<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.300> backpack

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
can be putting it into a backpack

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.820 
can be putting it into a backpack
because<00:05:31.810> these<00:05:31.990> are<00:05:32.110> gonna<00:05:32.200> get<00:05:32.380> folded<00:05:32.710> up

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
because these are gonna get folded up

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.440 
because these are gonna get folded up
all<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.130> time<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.820> I'm<00:05:33.970> afraid<00:05:34.150> it's<00:05:34.389> gonna

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
all the time and I'm afraid it's gonna

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.700 
all the time and I'm afraid it's gonna
rip<00:05:34.720> here<00:05:35.080> because<00:05:35.289> these<00:05:35.380> are<00:05:35.440> always

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
rip here because these are always

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.890 
rip here because these are always
getting<00:05:35.979> just<00:05:36.310> pulled<00:05:36.729> up<00:05:36.910> like<00:05:37.120> Jenk<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:37.840> I
