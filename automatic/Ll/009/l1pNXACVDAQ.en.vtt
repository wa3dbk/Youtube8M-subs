00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.460
 at the Sainte-Madeleine du Barroux abbey 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 laurent in the vaucluse between mont ventoux and laces of montmirail 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.559
 it's a 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.739
 QuÃšrard 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.719
 exceptional 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.279
 we cultures 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.139
 one of the riches of our region 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.609
 it is that the cultivation of olive trees 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.429
 at the abbey Sainte-Madeleine du Barroux we embarked on the 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.859
 transformation 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.169
 live in 2002 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.349
 we planted olive churches now we have them but no more 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 we prefer to pick olives pasciuto in the season 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.930
 when working with green olives 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 the aromas all the aromas consort more 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.900
 ranking 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.660
 for me did we start which one died 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.260
 we have kept 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.340
 but who amazes 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.600
 a minute before ending up on the ground to pick up the olives 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.220
 they fell in effect immediately 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.100
 when we arrive at the mill despite these olives and then we are unloaded in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 his speech 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.380
 not all talk about the subject of outbidding electronic balance a control 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.010
 chest not directly dj in the afternoon he from the treadmill who 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 leads to the baton 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 worked all his life 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.790
 it passes all to a large extent 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.540
 for the senator 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.540
 to see he told me very very hard for the job 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.710
 then we go straight into the hands 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.570
 it's granite 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.340
 you will contribute the joists a group crushed the pulpy to do 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.500
 get out the mile 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.820
 in defense we will try to specialize 8 the core inside 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 it allows to lower the bar dance while maintaining 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.230
 next I aim to bridge the gap especially this season 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.810
 then we send them in a mixer this mixer allows to homogenize the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.200
 part of bringing together all the little oyster shells to in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 make full fat and it then promotes separation 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.919
 him coming out of this device finally in a vertical centrifuge 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:12.269
 but for a big device that runs at 6000 rpm to finish 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.049
 to refine during this journey marc boyer no adjuvant we did not add anything 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:21.229
 in my head that's the same purpose the goal was to get the oil out of 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.909
 Lolif 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.139
 the oil comes to the end of the circuit in the centrifuge that does not violate at 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.389
 mcafee breakout 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.109
 it is he who will be the only goal is to finance 100% pure fruit juice 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.439
 once we took him out of the juicer 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.439
 while further to be able to keep it 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.689
 for bottling a bottling musician with a bib and 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.350
