00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
of our marathon training guide we

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.290 
of our marathon training guide we
outline<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.739> base<00:00:32.920> phase<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.400> training<00:00:33.580> now

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
outline the base phase of training now

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.880 
outline the base phase of training now
we<00:00:34.360> jump<00:00:34.690> into<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.960> power<00:00:35.140> phase<00:00:35.440> which<00:00:35.770> is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
we jump into the power phase which is

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.460 
we jump into the power phase which is
typically<00:00:36.370> weeks<00:00:36.610> 5<00:00:36.940> through<00:00:37.270> 8<00:00:37.300> we<00:00:38.260> not<00:00:38.440> only

typically weeks 5 through 8 we not only
are<00:00:38.769> going<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:38.949> be<00:00:39.040> increasing<00:00:39.489> your<00:00:39.580> long<00:00:39.790> run

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
are going to be increasing your long run

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.060 
are going to be increasing your long run
and<00:00:40.180> getting<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.480> up<00:00:40.660> over<00:00:40.870> 15<00:00:41.440> miles<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.860> run

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
and getting that up over 15 miles a run

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.979 
and getting that up over 15 miles a run
we're<00:00:42.699> also<00:00:42.850> going<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.180> be<00:00:43.300> increasing<00:00:43.809> some

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
we're also going to be increasing some

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.700 
of the other runs during the week
there's<00:00:46.449> three<00:00:46.690> key<00:00:46.900> workouts<00:00:47.350> during<00:00:47.620> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
there's three key workouts during the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.280 
there's three key workouts during the
week<00:00:47.860> we<00:00:48.340> might<00:00:48.580> have<00:00:48.790> one<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.660> temple

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
week we might have one that is a temple

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.100 
week we might have one that is a temple
run<00:00:50.530> which<00:00:50.769> is<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:50.949> longer<00:00:51.580> sustained<00:00:52.390> run

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
run which is a longer sustained run

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.810 
run which is a longer sustained run
where<00:00:53.320> we<00:00:53.470> might<00:00:53.620> be<00:00:53.769> running<00:00:53.920> those<00:00:54.250> at<00:00:54.519> half

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
where we might be running those at half

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.000 
where we might be running those at half
marathon<00:00:55.360> pace<00:00:55.540> to<00:00:55.870> your<00:00:56.140> marathon<00:00:56.410> goal<00:00:56.770> pace

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
and then we have our interval workouts

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.930 
and then we have our interval workouts
which<00:01:04.839> may<00:01:05.020> be<00:01:05.050> hill<00:01:05.710> repeats<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.340> maybe<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.910> a

now<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.680> power<00:01:23.830> phase<00:01:24.160> are<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.759> know<00:01:24.880> in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
now and the power phase are you know in

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.839 
now and the power phase are you know in
the<00:01:25.119> fifteen<00:01:25.630> plus<00:01:25.990> mile<00:01:26.289> range<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.459> we've

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:27.849 
the fifteen plus mile range so we've

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.370 
the fifteen plus mile range so we've
been<00:01:27.940> continuing<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.539> build<00:01:28.690> that<00:01:28.840> up<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.229> as

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380

we<00:01:29.560> go<00:01:29.709> through<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.069> power<00:01:30.250> phase<00:01:30.640> when<00:01:31.270> we

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
we go through the power phase when we

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.490 
we go through the power phase when we
get<00:01:31.509> towards<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.869> end<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.229> we're<00:01:32.410> going
