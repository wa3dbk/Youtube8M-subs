00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.540
 Y 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.010
 ah 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.380
 hi friends, today we are going to do this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 face that a friend asked me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.630
 tutorial is very simple very easy very 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.630
 fast root the with 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.600
 telephone directory sheets 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.940
 If I liked it, I liked it 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.670
 even without painting it 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.680
 to make these sticks because I use the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 fourth part of a directory sheet 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.090
 telephone and he 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.880
 for lithium 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.880
 that I use to roll up is very thin 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.780
 where not to get the stick from the stick 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.700
 we do not manage to keep those that go 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.760
 fabrics ranging tablecloths 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.040
 individual I did not have and I put what 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.090
 Desbarate and from there I took these sticks 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.090
 that have helped me a lot 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.430
 and I take care of them as I find nothing else 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.650
 slow 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.650
 let's make our pretty 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 in this way 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.480
 we put glue 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.750
 at the tip 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.700
 we call one 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.700
 and we crush it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.219
 let's double this way 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 from one side 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.320
 it will be like this 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.710
 we are going to bend more or less a finger 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.710
 an inch like that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.970
 let's double 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.440
 up 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.950
 we have them like that we do not double like that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.120
 then we are going to take another tube 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.120
 and we are going to double 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.060
 about half 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.440
 and we're going to put it in the middle 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.830
 if it's difficult for them like me because 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.760
 It is very small because we can put it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 glue or fasten with brooches we are 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.590
 putting here are the little chords and what 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.590
 will shape your face 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.740
 this those that were short with what 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.590
 we form the little ears is the body 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.550
 let's put once and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.550
 extensions here 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.160
 with glue 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.000
 From both sides 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.250
 in this is the part that we doubled already 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.850
 we climb 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.850
 now 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.930
 we put a false art we are going to crush 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.269
 the first 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.580
 let's put glue on both sides 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.440
 and we're going to put it here 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.720
 that is, in the doubles part 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.360
 it's bent like that and then we double it 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.770
 to the front and let's put a stick 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.770
 that does not come out much 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.620
 What are these little couples left ? 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.300
 and I stayed more or less on the shore 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.570
 we want we can also put 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.240
 glue here and these are the ones 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.320
 We are going to stick these little horns 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.430
 shape 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.430
 so it does not move anymore 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.500
 now 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.040
 let's go around with this is already 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.370
 stuck is no longer going to leave us and we are going to 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.760
 roll up that this is the trampita of the 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.760
 goat 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.950
 are six laps are six laps what 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.710
 is going to be the face of the goat 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.200
 then these are the squares the 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.830
 let's let up and we will 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.070
 continue weaving the body by rolling 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.940
 also in the same way we doubled it 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.569
 to give you mobility 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.240
 I was going to wind up not in this way 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:28.389
 how many times then three of us already 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.389
 finished the paper and we are going to put more 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.980
 I have a little bit we put glue 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.980
 it is about very well 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.669
 very well we are going to give 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:54.850
 about three turns up to the neck 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.850
 and let's start 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.749
 to weave 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:06.110
 so that the body is formed 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:09.040
 we take out here 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.040
 we name 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:28.420
 about four laps 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.440
 let's put the stick of the arms of 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.030
 this way well 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.030
 and we will continue weaving 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.300
 in the same way, just look good 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.990
 hold your arms and follow 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.990
 weaving 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.100
 in the end 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.030
 We are just going to make a knot 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.030
 very carefully 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.120
 in the arms and in the parantes that we 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.930
 are left of the fabric we make a knot 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:20.200
 we cut the little horns we give it shape and 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.830
 we already have our goat for my friend 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.470
