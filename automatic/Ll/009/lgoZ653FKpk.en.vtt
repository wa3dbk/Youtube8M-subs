00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.640
 coming samÃ³n el y 27 hello girls 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.770
 I hope you find the day very well 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.429
 today I bring you this video of a set 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.769
 that I became very natural did this and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 to share some tips 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.900
 for those who are just beginning like this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.089
 like me to avoid lifting 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.130
 premature look is very important almost 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.300
 I can almost assure you that if we do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.750
 well this step will not see lifting 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.870
 completely withdraw the price 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.570
 I first push cuticle with the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.180
 pusher at once with the knife that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.530
 come from the other side and remove all the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.530
 perigee absolutely 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.880
 ah 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.059
 right away we are going to remove what remains of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.950
 perigee with a grain file very very 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.380
 soft 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.190
 and we're also going to remove the brightness of the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.770
 nail to stick comes the acrylic 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.920
 let's remove the dust and apply a 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.170
 well here I apply alcohol and this 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.390
 also help to dehydrate the unipec 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.670
 and better the acrylic has to be removed 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 completely comes the girls powder 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 to avoid lifting here I already 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.960
 I have already issued the cut to the extent that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.229
 I shaped it and erased the union line 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.300
 of the dif because as my acrylic is 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.260
 transparent almost almost transparent 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.720
 why 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.500
 it carries the crystal acrylic only 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.410
 I put a pink blush pusher and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.230
 a pinch of like half pusher 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.900
 also acrylic yellow 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.550
 then I made this color that I liked 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.620
 a lot looks very natural 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.170
 Right away, guys, another guy that I 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.990
 I wanted to give is that when we're just going to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.050
 starting, it is very difficult for us to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 time to put our own nails this 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.560
 in the right hand web then a tip 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.380
 What I wanted to give them is to take a 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.479
 brush a little smaller than normal and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.250
 with this we will have more control over 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.670
 the acrylic and we will be able to apply the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.500
 the acrylic in a more uniform way 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.500
 without having to file so much 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.220
 here when I finish applying 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.770
 acrylic 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.620
 Well, no, I did not have anything left or anything 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.230
 and to the perfection of a little bit I already 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.400
 the couple are left and nothing else this 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.160
 decoy that is cuticle and polishes a bit 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.550
 my wrist immediately completely remove the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.160
 powder with alcohol and then nothing else 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.180
 expose our brightness to lamp 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.180
 our club 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.060
 we put our 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.130
 the nails to dry in the lamp and then 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.880
 that's all boys it's a good thing 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.890
 simple but I was thinking like that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.450
 if it was uploaded not by the same thing that is very 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.060
 simple 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.069
 I do not intend to teach this video with 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 do nails girls because I'm not a 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.300
 professional only wanted to share 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.870
 with you the tips that have given me 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.560
 helped a lot so that there is no longer 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.560
 premature lifting 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.950
