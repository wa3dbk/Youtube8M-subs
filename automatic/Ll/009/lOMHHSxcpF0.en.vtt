smoothie now they have sugars of their
own<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.960> fact<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.380> experiment<00:01:55.920> and

own in fact in this experiment and

own in fact in this experiment and
additional<00:01:56.430> tablespoon<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.390> sugar<00:01:57.600> it's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
additional tablespoon of sugar it's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.530 
additional tablespoon of sugar it's
worth<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> blood<00:01:59.640> sugar<00:01:59.909> spike<00:02:00.210> should<00:02:00.420> be

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
worth so the blood sugar spike should be

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
worth so the blood sugar spike should be
worse<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:01.250> No<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.420> did<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.650> no

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
worse right No not only did was there no

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
worse right No not only did was there no
additional<00:02:05.340> blood<00:02:05.490> sugar<00:02:05.759> spike<00:02:06.030> here's<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
additional blood sugar spike here's the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.070 
additional blood sugar spike here's the
critical<00:02:06.960> part<00:02:07.170> no<00:02:08.690> hypoglycemic<00:02:09.690> dip

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
critical part no hypoglycemic dip

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.130 
critical part no hypoglycemic dip
afterwards<00:02:11.030> blood<00:02:12.030> sugar<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.390> went<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
afterwards blood sugar just went up and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
afterwards blood sugar just went up and
down<00:02:13.349> without

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
down without

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
down without
that<00:02:14.040> overshoot<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> without<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.230> surge<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that overshoot and without the surge of

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.780 
that overshoot and without the surge of
fat<00:02:16.980> into<00:02:17.580> our<00:02:17.670> blood<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:19.650> difference<00:02:20.250> was

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
fat into our blood this difference was

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
fat into our blood this difference was
attributed<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> semi-solid<00:02:22.050> consistency

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
attributed to the semi-solid consistency

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.680

of the berry meals which may have

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.660 
of the berry meals which may have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
decreased the rate of stomach emptying

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.510 
decreased the rate of stomach emptying
compared<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:27.390> guzzling<00:02:28.050> sugar<00:02:28.530> water<00:02:28.770> in

now eat that same white bread with some
berries<00:03:37.380> though<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.430> you're<00:03:39.060> able<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.420> blunt

berries though and you're able to blunt
the<00:03:40.049> spike<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.950> even<00:03:41.160> though<00:03:41.280> you've

effectively added more sugars in the
form<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.250> berries<00:03:44.640> there's<00:03:45.239> less<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:46.230> an

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
so if you're gonna make pancakes make

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:15.160 
so if you're gonna make pancakes make
sure<00:03:56.670> they're<00:03:57.859> blueberry<00:03:58.859> pancakes

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170
