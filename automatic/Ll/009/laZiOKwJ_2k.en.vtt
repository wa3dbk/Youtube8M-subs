00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.950
 convenient 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 on the other hand on the final 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.759
 today I'm going to show how to eliminate a player 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.300
 the characteristics for default of the transmitter 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.060
 it's weird to know 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.550
 defender positioning 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.030
 and above all 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.040
 you have to look at yourself 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.060
 before receiving the ball I think that's 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.970
 that's very important 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.340
 the base of the footballer is the control 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.680
 a hitter 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.970
 important 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.400
 and once where you've managed just under control there starts a 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.980
 a bit 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 the game of llodra against 1 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.920
 and that's where it starts if the elimination of the players game by 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 dribbling by fears 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 by passes 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 ea 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 what's good is that he has a variety of dribbles 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.500
 heller that's what's interesting for the players who played on the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 sides a little bit how 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.020
 option number 1 small prominent spear defender on the side sell 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.650
 the procoralan anger 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.770
 hurt the law lang of the body to see before receiving Thursday where he was born 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.150
 the defender therefore always controls going on Thursday the violent provocative agent 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.080
 same year like that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.820
 ten years with acceleration 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.630
 here is what is good is that we entered the area of ​​repair 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.330
 in general it's difficult for a young defender of the old city and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.630
 there must be between m 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.670
 this is the best possible way for center-right abuse to wait for a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.670
 normal life in this case 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.019
 he then learns to see again 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.679
 then you have 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:26.939
 it's a little earlier 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.930
 it's a little bit more difficult in Asia realized it's not his kind 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.599
 after 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.609
 an acceleration 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.319
 so this is a sequence that limits but not easy affair 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.510
 but when it goes these pretty people are happy with the lack of efficiency 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.279
 2 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.469
 such 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.929
 5 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 the March regional elections 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.959
 their case he cited 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 what is called the small port 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.220
 m 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 4 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.989
 for our attackers want to try 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.499
 it's a dribble that will allow you to directly eliminate the tone 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.869
 opponent 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.869
 and in general 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.919
 point politically he is very very angry 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.559
 very pissed off as expensive 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 now I can show you 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.419
 a gesture that is a very important football today that's what we 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.450
 call another 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.130
 with the campaign and that's what allows you to evolve to general jones has 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.960
 played by the media 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.230
 the opposing defense and it must be said that it was because he was sitting 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.249
 egypt egypt 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 here 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.789
 I had planned 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.499
 for him the footballer 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.520
 and more and more fast with a lot of movement 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.370
 so it takes to please this intelligence on arrival I believe that 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.300
 m 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.300
 we were doing well 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.449
 the employment center 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.809
 room 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.169
 now here 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.550
 gentlemen it's up to us to work 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.819
 to perfect your technique I do not wish 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.719
 good luck
