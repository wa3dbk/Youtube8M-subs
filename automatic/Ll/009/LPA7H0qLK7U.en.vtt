00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
of that junk in it it's easy you just

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.660 
of that junk in it it's easy you just
repeat<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.549> process<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> you're<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.549> gonna

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
repeat the process so you're just gonna

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.150 
repeat the process so you're just gonna
dump<00:03:16.180> snow<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.570> there<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.890> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
dump snow on there so this is on the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.740 
dump snow on there so this is on the
polyester<00:03:21.820> thing<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.829> gonna<00:03:24.070> um<00:03:24.750> require

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
polyester thing this is gonna um require

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.610 
polyester thing this is gonna um require
more<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.700> do<00:03:28.359> is<00:03:28.480> scrape<00:03:28.900> everything

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
more of it so do is scrape everything

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.270 
more of it so do is scrape everything
down

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
down

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.699 
down
once<00:03:30.790> you're<00:03:31.060> done<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.690> make<00:03:32.049> sure<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.260> spread

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
once you're done but make sure to spread

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.830 
once you're done but make sure to spread
everything<00:03:32.920> first<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.359> this<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.600> gonna<00:03:34.750> be

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
everything first and this is gonna be

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.590 
everything first and this is gonna be
harder<00:03:35.170> because<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.560> need<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.859> have<00:03:36.160> more<00:03:36.600> um

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
harder because you need to have more um

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.720 
harder because you need to have more um
so<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.470> guess<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:40.690> scrub<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.579> hard

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
so I guess just scrub it and it's hard

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.300 
so I guess just scrub it and it's hard
because<00:03:42.850> it's<00:03:43.239> magnet<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.959> your<00:03:44.290> spoon<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.070> my

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
because it's magnet and your spoon is my

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.640 
because it's magnet and your spoon is my
spoon<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:45.880> magnet<00:03:46.560> my<00:03:47.560> gorse<00:03:47.950> my<00:03:48.220> spoon<00:03:48.579> um

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
spoon it's magnet my gorse my spoon um

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.960 
spoon it's magnet my gorse my spoon um
so<00:03:50.650> yeah<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.040> kind<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.370> harder

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:04.870 

so<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.060> look<00:03:56.210> it<00:03:58.180> over<00:03:59.180> here<00:04:03.490> London<00:04:04.490> I'm<00:04:04.610> just
