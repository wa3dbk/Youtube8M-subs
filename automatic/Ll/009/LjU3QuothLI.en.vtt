00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.400
 good friends of youtube today I bring you 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.090
 a review of a terminal 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.250
 has a very good price is the blueduck 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.800
 4.0 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.800
 here we can see it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.090
 let's see what the ignition is going 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.960
 to turn on as you can see I bought it in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.960
 the company tivo 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.310
 we wait for him to turn on 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 Y 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.360
 and here is how we can see this 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:59.980
 terminal comes with what the system is 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.980
 operative android 4.2.2 and the living 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.449
 and as we can see 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.409
 is 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 very fluid 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 as the phone specifications 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.409
 We can observe 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.520
 Blood Ice 4.0 version of Android 4.2.2 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.520
 of iprim 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 This is 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.920
 the model and we can observe it blood 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:47.720
 ice 4.0 of 261 to which it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.330
 there is a 260 because what is the same 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.300
 bluetooth 4.0 but with less less 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.650
 specifications a little bit is a bit more 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.650
 a little slower so to speak 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.780
 what we are going to do today 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.000
 is the test to the benchmark as we can 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.569
 observe the application here 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.780
 let 's open the application 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.290
 version 4 the last as they can 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.129
 observe this was the score the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 last time 11,000 53 points which as 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:30.859
 it says and wood well were telephones 120 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.230
 dollars here in Honduras I live which 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.400
 in the USA it can be achieved for less than 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.890
 100 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.100
 let's do what is the test 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.900
 so 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.900
 and here it is already running 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.480
 this terminal has a processor 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:56.130
 dual-core at 1.3 giga hertz has 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.680
 a ram memory of 512 mb 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.130
 with a 4- inch screen with 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.820
 resolution 480 x 800 pixels with a 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.920
 density of 233 ppi and bone pixels by 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.170
 inch for which makes it have 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.960
 very good definition of screens very 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.700
 clear the screen 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.819
 as we can see the colors are 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.470
 alive 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.470
 pretty nice the phone 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.160
 also the integrated video chip is 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.560
 a bad one and 400 mp which is something very 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.950
 surprising for being such a phone 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.830
 cheap and as we know the Mali 400 just 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.370
 come galaxy devices like the s2 and 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.370
 s3 and some xperia and hesperia 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.889
 It has a 5 megapixel screen 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.920
 as you can see here with a camera 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.960
 forgive a 5 megapixel camera the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.700
 which one 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.130
 good picture you could say it's not the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.740
 better camera but taken good picture with 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.100
 good light despite its price is good 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:10.480
 camera also has a front camera 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.150
 which is used for video calls which if 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.320
 there is not very good clarity is not going to see 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.510
 nothing has to be quality mica 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.010
 To make it look 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.600
 a video more or less well is not something 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.820
 surprising because of the quality by 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.980
 the price you have do not ask much 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.540
 as well 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.360
 here we see how the test is 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.650
 performing for 57% has a 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.480
 internal memory of 4 gb which 1.3 if 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.240
 I'm not wrong gigabytes are for 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.890
 applications and 2 gigabytes are for what 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.510
 that is being our files or 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.750
 be the user and all that music 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.750
 video 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.070
 has 4g technology 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.320
 so data is going to be the speed can 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.850
 swim navigation 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.850
 here we can observe the performance 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.850
 already running 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.990
 and the truth had this phone makes 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.759
 a week and I highly recommend it 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.580
 pretty good enough for the price that 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.919
 have I think I do not need this phone 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.649
 with pay to performance and the 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.719
 price that has that savings and we can 

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.900
 prepare the 3d test which is 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.580
 quite 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.080
 a phone this the price I think I 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.110
 would happen of the 5 frames per second 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.110
 and I'm like we can see it goes from 15 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.870
 how it runs 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.940
 very good the truth is I have games 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.730
 I've tried games like trigger 2 and 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.890
 it flowed fluid fluid like it was 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.860
 made for this phone runs 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.820
 pretty fluid applications 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.300
 and we have respect 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:01.639
 and we can see the table 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:04.039
 good uncle 10.793 is above the s2 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.169
 well, the average must end in 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:10.819
 the action question first of all goes from 10 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.610
 thousand 500 to 11 thousand nine hundred out there 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.540
 an average of about 11 thousand 11,000 points 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.580
 walk which is pretty good 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.910
 as you can see here we go the 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.289
 details 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:26.950
 and in 1795 93 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:30.310
 andrew 4.2 semantics 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.889
 the cpu as I say is dual core to 1.3 and 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.330
 low 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.330
 they showed me how we can observe 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:42.560
 the 13 in 2d in 3d was a good very 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.440
 good score by the beginning has 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.250
 and we can do for the 7 video 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.680
 normal and 400 mp what makes it 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.270
 good game performance good as 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.130
 can observe this was all and the 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.220
 true if you are thinking about buying a 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.690
 phone very cheap and with that you have there 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.620
 that really is worth what we invest 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:07.260
 I recommend the plus 4.0 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.919
 but if that does look for the version that 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.620
 comes with 4.2.2 and the port living 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:16.290
 factory because it has better performance 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.830
 that the one that brings ice cream sandwich 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:23.009
 four points 0.4 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:27.030
 those that brings a video chip 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:30.030
 mother 1 203 and the cpu is a 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:33.270
 if I'm not mistaken it 's a decorated unit 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:37.220
 which it has done to 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.410
 observe 10,700 points we walk well 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.129
 If this was all but you liked the 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.139
 video 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:44.810
 and please like me and if I 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:48.020
 taste 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:53.020
 and comment that you thought 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
 I hope in your comments this was all
