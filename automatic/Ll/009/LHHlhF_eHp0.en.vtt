bill that you know perfect world we get
to<00:03:00.070> try<00:03:00.250> here<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:01.020> work<00:03:02.020> out<00:03:02.230> how<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:02.980> want<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
to try here and work out how we want to

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.010 
to try here and work out how we want to
go<00:03:03.460> forward<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.880> know<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.150> some<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.960> those

go forward to know if some of those

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.660 
go forward to know if some of those
things<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.590> cross<00:03:05.770> them<00:03:05.860> off<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.130> list<00:03:06.340> it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
things we can cross them off the list it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.200 
things we can cross them off the list it
makes<00:03:06.970> life<00:03:07.180> easier<00:03:07.630> down<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.020> road<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:09.210> it's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
makes life easier down the road and it's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.670 
makes life easier down the road and it's
not<00:03:10.390> always<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> case<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:11.170> working<00:03:11.470> out<00:03:11.530> what

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
not always the case of working out what

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.990 
not always the case of working out what
to<00:03:11.770> do<00:03:11.860> its<00:03:12.010> work<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:12.460> not<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to do its work now what not to do and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.790 
to do its work now what not to do and
and<00:03:13.720> that's<00:03:13.900> what<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.230> testing<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.650> all

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
and that's what this testing is all

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.080 
and that's what this testing is all
about

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.699 

having<00:03:18.629> seen<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> car<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.290> first<00:03:19.470> time

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
having seen the car the first time

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.110 
having seen the car the first time
yesterday<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.310> track<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.610> thought<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.030> was

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
yesterday on track I thought it was

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.940 
yesterday on track I thought it was
pretty<00:03:21.450> impressive<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:22.080> got<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> lot<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.680> grip

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
pretty impressive it's got a lot of grip

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.680 
pretty impressive it's got a lot of grip
and<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.129> goes<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.430> corn<00:03:23.730> as<00:03:23.819> well<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and it goes to the corn as well it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.930 
and it goes to the corn as well it
breaks<00:03:24.959> late<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.129> think<00:03:26.340> you'll<00:03:26.550> get<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> see

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
breaks late so I think you'll get to see

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.580 
breaks late so I think you'll get to see
that<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> lot<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.629> races<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.140> year<00:03:28.200> where

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
that a lot of races this year where

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.949 
that a lot of races this year where
you'll<00:03:29.310> be<00:03:29.340> amazed<00:03:29.730> how<00:03:29.879> deep<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.690> break

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
you'll be amazed how deep we can break

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.589 
you'll be amazed how deep we can break
with<00:03:31.140> these<00:03:31.290> new<00:03:31.440> cars<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.239> spoke<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.450> couple

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
with these new cars I spoke to a couple

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.420 
with these new cars I spoke to a couple
of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> guys<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.410> they<00:03:34.650> talked<00:03:34.920> about<00:03:35.220> how

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
of the guys and they talked about how

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.890 
of the guys and they talked about how
difficult<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.030> breaking<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:36.750> it's

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
difficult that breaking is because it's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.960 
difficult that breaking is because it's
so<00:03:37.019> short<00:03:37.319> it's<00:03:37.920> very<00:03:38.129> easy<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> lock<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> wheel

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
so short it's very easy to lock a wheel

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.509 
so short it's very easy to lock a wheel
and<00:03:39.269> slide<00:03:39.720> off<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.200> yeah<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.129> think<00:03:41.160> you'll

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
and slide off so yeah I think you'll

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.059 
and slide off so yeah I think you'll
you'll<00:03:41.790> see<00:03:41.940> some<00:03:42.180> interesting<00:03:42.900> action<00:03:43.890> pack

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
you'll see some interesting action pack

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.500 
you'll see some interesting action pack
racing<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.670> going<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.849> be<00:03:44.970> nerve-wracking

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
racing it's going to be nerve-wracking

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.059 
racing it's going to be nerve-wracking
for<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.690> drivers<00:03:46.049> knowing<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.560> it's

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
for the drivers knowing that it's

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.220 
for the drivers knowing that it's
critical<00:03:47.580> where<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.180> break<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.780> how<00:03:49.170> you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
critical where you break and how you

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.160 
critical where you break and how you
break<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.269> I'm<00:03:51.269> looking<00:03:51.450> forward<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.019> think

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
break so I'm looking forward to I think

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.289 
break so I'm looking forward to I think
it<00:03:52.440> looks<00:03:52.590> great<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:53.519> soon<00:03:53.760> get<00:03:53.880> used<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
it looks great you soon get used to the

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.050 
it looks great you soon get used to the
new<00:03:54.420> contract<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.230> soon<00:03:55.860> becomes<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.610> norm

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
new contract it soon becomes the norm

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020 
new contract it soon becomes the norm
and<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.980> know<00:03:59.069> hopefully<00:03:59.250> it's<00:03:59.700> going<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.910> put

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
and you know hopefully it's going to put

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.950 
and you know hopefully it's going to put
on<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.150> good<00:04:00.299> show

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.990 

at<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.650> date<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> lot<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.400> unknowns<00:04:05.730> with

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
at this date is a lot of unknowns with

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.610 
at this date is a lot of unknowns with
the<00:04:06.090> three<00:04:06.300> engine<00:04:06.570> manufacturers<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.290> just

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the three engine manufacturers you just

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.650 
the three engine manufacturers you just
don't<00:04:07.770> really<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.120> who's<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.450> be<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
don't really know who's going to be the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870 
don't really know who's going to be the
strongest<00:04:10.220> who's<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.490> be<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.700> most

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
strongest who's going to be the most

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.820 
strongest who's going to be the most
reliable<00:04:12.150> obviously<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.930> lot<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.440> factors

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
reliable obviously is a lot of factors

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.560 
reliable obviously is a lot of factors
but<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.280> think<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.300> make<00:04:15.420> it

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
but I think that's going to make it

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.540 
but I think that's going to make it
interesting<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.110> think<00:04:16.170> you'll<00:04:17.100> get<00:04:17.250> teams

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
interesting I think you'll get teams

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.340 
interesting I think you'll get teams
coming<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.030> stronger<00:04:18.360> later<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.990> year<00:04:19.170> and

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
coming on stronger later in the year and

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.140 
coming on stronger later in the year and
you<00:04:19.920> know<00:04:20.040> have<00:04:20.340> some<00:04:20.520> teams<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.880> are<00:04:20.970> strong

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
you know have some teams that are strong

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.100 
you know have some teams that are strong
early<00:04:21.450> on<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.340> hopefully<00:04:23.420> we<00:04:24.420> can<00:04:24.780> put<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.050> all

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
early on so hopefully we can put it all

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.620 
early on so hopefully we can put it all
together<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.010> great<00:04:26.280> season<00:04:26.630> our

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
together and have a great season our

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.680 
together and have a great season our
goal<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.500> win<00:04:28.680> race<00:04:28.890> again<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:30.210> know<00:04:30.300> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
goal is to win race again and you know I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.390 
goal is to win race again and you know I
think<00:04:30.780> we've<00:04:31.350> got<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> reasonable<00:04:32.070> chance<00:04:32.250> of

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
think we've got a reasonable chance of

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.740 
think we've got a reasonable chance of
that<00:04:32.550> we<00:04:32.790> just<00:04:32.940> got<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.120> make<00:04:33.180> sure<00:04:33.240> we<00:04:33.480> do<00:04:33.600> all

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
that we just got to make sure we do all

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.860 
that we just got to make sure we do all
the<00:04:33.840> foundation<00:04:34.320> work<00:04:34.470> correctly
