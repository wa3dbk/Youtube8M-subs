00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
actual release date so I'm pretty sure

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.510

doesn't require any pre orders or any of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
doesn't require any pre orders or any of
that<00:00:58.620> nonsense<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.670> know<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.420> actually

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that nonsense I know they have actually

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
that nonsense I know they have actually
released<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> system<00:01:01.710> requirements<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
closed alpha and this is for the closed

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.730 
closed alpha and this is for the closed
alpha<00:01:04.860> only<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> definitely<00:01:06.540> not

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
alpha only so this is definitely not

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that still have 32-bit operating systems

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.749 
that still have 32-bit operating systems
I<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.630> far<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.140> GPU<00:01:49.619> you'll<00:01:50.369> need<00:01:50.579> at

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
I know as far as your GPU you'll need at

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.480 
I know as far as your GPU you'll need at
least<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.630> gtx<00:01:52.229> 680<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:53.100> an<00:01:53.520> AMD<00:01:53.880> radeon<00:01:54.540> 7970

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
least a gtx 680 or an AMD radeon 7970

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
least a gtx 680 or an AMD radeon 7970
with<00:01:56.490> two<00:01:56.729> gigabytes<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.479> memory<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
with two gigabytes of memory so for

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
with two gigabytes of memory so for
minimum<00:01:59.070> requirements<00:01:59.820> that's<00:02:00.000> actually

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
minimum requirements that's actually

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
minimum requirements that's actually
pretty<00:02:00.630> demanding<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.340> mentioned

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
pretty demanding and like I mentioned

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.010 
pretty demanding and like I mentioned
before<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:03.180> requirements<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.990> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
before these requirements are not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
before these requirements are not
representative<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.729> full<00:02:05.939> game<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.420> I'm

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
representative of the full game as I'm

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
representative of the full game as I'm
sure<00:02:06.600> dice<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.229> still<00:02:07.469> optimizing<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> game

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
sure dice is still optimizing the game

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699 
sure dice is still optimizing the game
and<00:02:08.759> things<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> went<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and things like that so I went and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.880 
and things like that so I went and
upgrade<00:02:11.220> your<00:02:11.400> graphics<00:02:11.670> unit<00:02:12.480> quite<00:02:13.200> yet

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
upgrade your graphics unit quite yet

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
upgrade your graphics unit quite yet
definitely<00:02:14.340> wait<00:02:14.550> until<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.180> get

the full release version requirements
before<00:02:18.569> upgrading<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.470> system<00:02:19.980> now<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
before upgrading my system now the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.480 
before upgrading my system now the
closed<00:02:21.120> alpha<00:02:21.390> begins<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:22.080> july<00:02:22.560> second<00:02:23.280> which
