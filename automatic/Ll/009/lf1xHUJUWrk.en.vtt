steampunk theme inside the home which i

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.740

think<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.360> pretty<00:00:36.540> cool<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.239> might<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.600> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
think is pretty cool but it might not be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.630 
think is pretty cool but it might not be
the<00:00:39.960> best<00:00:40.170> immersion<00:00:40.710> lies<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.340> it's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the best immersion lies but I think it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
the best immersion lies but I think it's
pretty<00:00:41.820> sweet<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.899> anyways<00:00:43.379> outside<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> got

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
pretty sweet so anyways outside you got

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
mod is that in most rooms I think

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.710

actually<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.940> could<00:01:21.120> turn<00:01:21.450> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
actually all of them you could turn on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
actually all of them you could turn on
or<00:01:21.840> off<00:01:21.870> lights<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:23.190> when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.550> first<00:01:23.730> get<00:01:23.910> the

or off lights so when you first get the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.430 
or off lights so when you first get the
mod<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> might<00:01:24.540> need<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> torch<00:01:25.320> in

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
mod you might need to have a torch in

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.110 
mod you might need to have a torch in
hand<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.800> find<00:01:26.040> these<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.520> lights<00:01:26.790> but

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
hand to find these little lights but

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.970 
hand to find these little lights but
they're<00:01:27.480> on<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:28.290> walls<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> usually

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
they're on the walls and they usually

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.670 
they're on the walls and they usually
have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.490> red<00:01:29.820> valve<00:01:30.120> on<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> doing<00:01:31.560> or

have a little red valve on a doing or
piping<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.830> let's<00:01:34.830> go<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.160> upstairs

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
piping and then let's go to the upstairs

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.590 
piping and then let's go to the upstairs
portion

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
portion

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.270 
portion
so<00:01:37.990> this<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.230> kind<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.560> like<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.710> storage<00:01:39.040> area

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
