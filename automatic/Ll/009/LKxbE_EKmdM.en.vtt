00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
taking it out is just remember remember

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
taking it out is just remember remember
exactly<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.149> it<00:01:24.329> fit<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.869> don't<00:01:24.929> want<00:01:25.109> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
exactly how it fit in you don't want to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.239 
exactly how it fit in you don't want to
put<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.469> in<00:01:25.619> backwards<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.369> won't<00:01:26.579> be<00:01:26.700> good

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
put that in backwards it won't be good

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.349 
put that in backwards it won't be good
now<00:01:29.249> the<00:01:29.310> real<00:01:29.490> reason<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.969> games<00:01:30.149> have

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
now the real reason that the games have

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.179 
now the real reason that the games have
trouble<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.929> because<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:31.590> metal

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
trouble is because of these metal

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
trouble is because of these metal
contacts<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.969> can<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.389> over<00:01:33.569> time<00:01:33.689> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
contacts as you can see over time that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
contacts as you can see over time that
builds<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.710> dirt<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:34.950> grime<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.609> you<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.819> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
builds up dirt and grime and you need to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
builds up dirt and grime and you need to
clean<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:36.569> so<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> those<00:01:37.679> metal

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
clean that off so that those metal

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
clean that off so that those metal
contacts<00:01:38.429> can<00:01:38.639> make<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.539> connection<00:01:40.049> with

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
contacts can make a good connection with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.069 
contacts can make a good connection with
a<00:01:40.259> Nintendo<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:40.829> via<00:01:41.520> Nintendo's<00:01:42.389> 72<00:01:42.899> pin

going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.359> some<00:01:48.569> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.859> game<00:01:49.859> cleaning

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249
