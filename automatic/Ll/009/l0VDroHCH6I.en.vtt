00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
this side a one cool thing they did with

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.599 
this side a one cool thing they did with
this<00:01:38.049> knife<00:01:38.289> is<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.600> pocket<00:01:41.200> clip<00:01:41.439> where<00:01:42.429> it

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
this knife is the pocket clip where it

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.300 
this knife is the pocket clip where it
mounts<00:01:43.329> onto<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:43.990> g10<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.499> actually<00:01:44.829> recessed

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
mounts onto the g10 is actually recessed

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.249 
mounts onto the g10 is actually recessed
so<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.579> sits<00:01:45.759> in<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:45.969> little<00:01:46.209> bit<00:01:46.359> on<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.020> side

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
so it sits in a little bit on this side

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.379 
so it sits in a little bit on this side
they<00:01:47.409> have<00:01:47.439> like<00:01:47.679> a<00:01:47.709> little<00:01:47.950> metal<00:01:48.310> plate<00:01:48.609> to

they have like a little metal plate to
take<00:01:49.599> place<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.170> void<00:01:50.409> because<00:01:50.679> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
take place of that void because the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.620 
take place of that void because the
pocket<00:01:51.279> clip<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.549> not<00:01:51.700> there<00:01:51.939> anymore<00:01:52.149> and

pocket clip is not there anymore and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.300 
pocket clip is not there anymore and
they<00:01:52.810> added<00:01:53.049> two<00:01:53.200> screws<00:01:53.590> there<00:01:53.799> for<00:01:54.039> you<00:01:54.159> so

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
that's a pretty nice touch now I haven't

resurrection<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:01.689> don't<00:02:01.899> know<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.049> this<00:02:02.289> is

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
resurrection so I don't know if this is

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.469 
resurrection so I don't know if this is
something<00:02:02.679> that<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:03.490> poker<00:02:04.029> has<00:02:04.209> also

didn't<00:02:08.290> have<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:08.620> it<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.010> it<00:02:09.490> looks<00:02:09.640> pretty

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
didn't have to do it and it looks pretty

this<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:13.270> too<00:02:13.480> bad<00:02:13.690> at<00:02:13.870> all<00:02:14.040> jumping<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.130> the

this not too bad at all jumping on the

this not too bad at all jumping on the
top<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.640> blade<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.090> mild<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.810> doesn't

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
top of the blade is mild so it doesn't

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.140 
top of the blade is mild so it doesn't
really<00:02:17.200> burn<00:02:17.560> your<00:02:17.770> fingers<00:02:18.100> too<00:02:18.310> much<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:19.000> all

really burn your fingers too much at all
if<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.140> use<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.620> while<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.790> notice

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
if you use it for a while if you notice

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.540 
if you use it for a while if you notice
your<00:02:22.210> guys<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.830> top<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.310> blade<00:02:24.520> and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
your guys be the top of the blade and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.730 
your guys be the top of the blade and
jimping<00:02:25.000> goes<00:02:25.180> down<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.930> drops<00:02:26.170> down<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
jimping goes down it drops down about a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.040 
jimping goes down it drops down about a
about<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.370> millimeter<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.180> bad<00:02:28.540> maybe<00:02:28.720> half<00:02:29.020> a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
about a millimeter so bad maybe half a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.360 
about a millimeter so bad maybe half a
millimeter<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:29.650> they<00:02:29.770> did<00:02:29.920> round<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.340> off

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
millimeter now they did round that off

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.760 
millimeter now they did round that off
so<00:02:30.730> there's<00:02:30.940> not<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> sharp<00:02:31.420> edge<00:02:31.600> there<00:02:31.930> but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
so there's not a sharp edge there but

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.320 
so there's not a sharp edge there but
the<00:02:32.920> difference<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.640> elevation<00:02:34.240> between

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the difference is in elevation between

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.110 
the difference is in elevation between
your<00:02:34.750> handle<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.380> blade<00:02:35.700> may<00:02:36.700> burn<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
your handle and your blade may burn you

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.610 
your handle and your blade may burn you
up<00:02:37.150> after<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> while<00:02:37.660> if<00:02:37.810> you're<00:02:37.930> leaning<00:02:38.440> back

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
up after a while if you're leaning back

up after a while if you're leaning back
on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> knife<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.670> if<00:02:39.970> you're<00:02:40.090> choking

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
on the knife like this if you're choking

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.300 
on the knife like this if you're choking
up<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:41.380> not<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.740> bother<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.100> if

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
up it's not going to bother you but if

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.580 
up it's not going to bother you but if
you're<00:02:42.400> back<00:02:42.580> here<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.170> where<00:02:44.170> your<00:02:44.290> fingers

you're back here and where your fingers

you're back here and where your fingers
naturally<00:02:45.070> rest<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.910> may<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.150> an<00:02:46.330> issue<00:02:46.480> after

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
naturally rest it may be an issue after

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.480 
naturally rest it may be an issue after
a<00:02:46.990> while<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.770> would<00:02:47.920> probably<00:02:48.160> be<00:02:48.310> after

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
a while and that would probably be after

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.270 
a while and that would probably be after
a<00:02:48.640> long<00:02:48.850> while<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.270> hard<00:02:49.480> use<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:51.070> for

a long while of hard use on that but for

a long while of hard use on that but for

basically the action on this is pre list

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.210 
basically the action on this is pre list
so<00:04:01.150> what'll<00:04:01.450> end<00:04:01.540> up<00:04:01.660> happening<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:02.380> because

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
pivot on there to straighten out an

pivot on there to straighten out an
off-center<00:04:06.910> blade<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.900> it's<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.380> if<00:04:08.620> you

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
off-center blade if it's a if you

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.070 
off-center blade if it's a if you
tighten

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
tighten

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.390 
tighten
which<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.440> torques<00:04:10.740> is<00:04:10.890> usually<00:04:11.190> on<00:04:11.250> this

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
which the torques is usually on this

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.560 
which the torques is usually on this
side<00:04:11.550> like<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.790> mentioned<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.210> you<00:04:12.330> tighten

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
side like I mentioned if you tighten

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.050 
side like I mentioned if you tighten
this<00:04:12.780> side<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.740> blade<00:04:14.040> will<00:04:14.190> kick<00:04:14.370> over<00:04:14.520> that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
this side the blade will kick over that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.020 
this side the blade will kick over that
way<00:04:15.709> if<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:16.890> usually<00:04:17.519> if<00:04:17.580> it's<00:04:17.670> too<00:04:17.850> loose

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
way if it's usually if it's too loose

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.960 
way if it's usually if it's too loose
the<00:04:18.239> play<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.510> end<00:04:18.600> up<00:04:18.810> leaning<00:04:19.140> back<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.530> way

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
the play to end up leaning back this way

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.580 
the play to end up leaning back this way
this<00:04:20.970> blade<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.239> leading<00:04:21.720> over<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.170> my<00:04:22.350> right

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
this blade is leading over to my right

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.910 
this blade is leading over to my right
or<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.460> side<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:24.380> basically<00:04:25.380> all<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.680> have

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
or to this side and basically all I have

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.890 
or to this side and basically all I have
to<00:04:26.010> do<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.280> put<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.670> a<00:04:26.700> quarter<00:04:27.120> turn<00:04:27.330> on<00:04:27.660> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
to do is put like a quarter turn on the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.050 
to do is put like a quarter turn on the
torques<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.590> side<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.790> will<00:04:29.880> plug

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
torques on this side and it will plug

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.300 
torques on this side and it will plug
that<00:04:30.270> way<00:04:30.510> now<00:04:31.110> it'll<00:04:31.350> tighten<00:04:31.590> up<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.890> action

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
that way now it'll tighten up the action

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.940 
that way now it'll tighten up the action
a<00:04:32.340> little<00:04:32.580> bit<00:04:32.730> but<00:04:33.140> it's<00:04:34.140> not<00:04:34.350> bad<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.740> all<00:04:34.800> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
a little bit but it's not bad at all the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.430 
a little bit but it's not bad at all the
action<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.310> pretty<00:04:35.550> loose<00:04:35.790> if<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.210> ops<00:04:37.020> it

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
action is pretty loose if it is ops it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.070 
action is pretty loose if it is ops it
may<00:04:37.650> have<00:04:37.710> loosened<00:04:38.100> up<00:04:38.250> from<00:04:38.490> break-in

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
may have loosened up from break-in

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.240 
may have loosened up from break-in
because<00:04:40.080> when<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.410> gotta<00:04:40.650> believe<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.130> was<00:04:41.220> a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
because when I gotta believe it was a

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.830 
because when I gotta believe it was a
lot<00:04:41.430> more<00:04:41.580> senator<00:04:41.940> than<00:04:42.060> what<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.300> now<00:04:42.420> was

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
lot more senator than what it is now was

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.510 
lot more senator than what it is now was
like<00:04:42.960> dead<00:04:43.230> on<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.920> little<00:04:44.160> off<00:04:44.280> now

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
like dead on it's just a little off now

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.580 
like dead on it's just a little off now
so<00:04:45.240> I'll<00:04:45.600> probably<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:45.930> end<00:04:46.050> up<00:04:46.170> popping<00:04:46.350> off

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
so I'll probably just end up popping off

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.480 
so I'll probably just end up popping off
these<00:04:46.740> screws<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.190> give<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.400> little

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
these screws and give it a little

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.250 
these screws and give it a little
tighten<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.060> it'll<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.360> right<00:04:48.510> back<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.990> point

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
tighten and it'll be right back on point

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740 
tighten and it'll be right back on point
so<00:04:50.010> not<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.550> bad<00:04:50.790> knife<00:04:51.000> special<00:04:51.420> for<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.570> money

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
so not a bad knife special for the money

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.680 
so not a bad knife special for the money
large<00:04:52.440> knife<00:04:53.240> definitely<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.270> large<00:04:54.480> knife

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
large knife definitely a large knife

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.260 
large knife definitely a large knife

i'll actually have more cutting surface

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.680 
i'll actually have more cutting surface
