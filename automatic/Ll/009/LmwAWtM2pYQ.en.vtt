Batman it's a solid game actually it's
great<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.390> some<00:03:55.569> areas<00:03:55.989> however<00:03:56.230> its<00:03:57.069> story

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
great in some areas however its story

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.089 
great in some areas however its story
left<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.970> lot<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.180> be<00:03:58.390> desired<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:59.050> also<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
left a lot to be desired and also the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.770 
left a lot to be desired and also the
limited<00:04:00.610> hub<00:04:00.819> world<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.300> they<00:04:01.420> give<00:04:01.599> you

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
limited hub world that they give you

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.270 
limited hub world that they give you
just<00:04:01.810> kind<00:04:02.230> of<00:04:02.319> felt<00:04:02.560> more<00:04:02.800> annoying<00:04:03.250> to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
just kind of felt more annoying to

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.100 
just kind of felt more annoying to
travel<00:04:03.700> across<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.150> actually<00:04:04.420> fun<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.660> me<00:04:04.930> in

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
travel across and actually fun to me in

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.070 
travel across and actually fun to me in
which<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.980> got<00:04:06.099> fixed<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.640> mostly<00:04:06.970> Arkham<00:04:07.750> City

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
which it got fixed in mostly Arkham City

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.680 
which it got fixed in mostly Arkham City
so<00:04:08.680> that's<00:04:08.860> good<00:04:09.099> anyway<00:04:09.640> it's<00:04:10.120> brings<00:04:10.420> some

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
so that's good anyway it's brings some

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.509 
so that's good anyway it's brings some
aspects<00:04:11.200> but<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.440> hardly<00:04:11.830> think<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.190> deserves

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
aspects but I hardly think it deserves

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.220 
aspects but I hardly think it deserves
all<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.819> 10<00:04:13.030> out<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> tens<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:13.750> got<00:04:13.989> but
