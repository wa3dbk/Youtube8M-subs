00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
that exposure a lot of times I use my

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.720 
that exposure a lot of times I use my
reverse<00:00:40.899> and<00:00:41.379> you<00:00:41.410> grad<00:00:41.739> here<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.219> when<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:42.579> got

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
reverse and you grad here to when we got

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.490 
reverse and you grad here to when we got
that<00:00:42.879> really<00:00:43.390> bright<00:00:43.600> strip<00:00:43.929> of<00:00:44.109> mountains

exposing a little bit more you just got
to<00:00:59.230> move<00:00:59.440> quick<00:00:59.769> in<00:01:00.760> these<00:01:00.909> cases<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:03.010> that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
to move quick in these cases and that's

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.650 
to move quick in these cases and that's
looking<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.519> little<00:01:03.699> bit<00:01:03.879> better<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.330> me<00:01:04.449> right

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
looking a little bit better to me right

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.080 
looking a little bit better to me right
there<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.470> try<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:08.740> now<00:01:09.310> with<00:01:09.760> just<00:01:09.940> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
there going to try it now with just a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.050 
there going to try it now with just a
two-stop<00:01:10.720> hard<00:01:11.110> ND<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.220> i'm<00:01:12.640> not<00:01:12.850> going<00:01:13.030> to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
two-stop hard ND and i'm not going to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.590 
two-stop hard ND and i'm not going to
get<00:01:13.240> such<00:01:13.480> a<00:01:13.510> heavy<00:01:14.490> gradient<00:01:15.490> in<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.700> top<00:01:15.940> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.270 

little<00:01:19.600> bit<00:01:19.810> better<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.110> can<00:01:20.380> see<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:21.160> it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
little bit better you can see and it

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.980 
little bit better you can see and it
looks<00:01:21.460> quite<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.180> bit<00:01:22.300> different<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:22.930> a

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
looks quite a bit different it's a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.980 
looks quite a bit different it's a
different<00:01:23.020> feel<00:01:23.650> for<00:01:23.890> sure<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.600> reverse

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
different feel for sure with the reverse

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.280 
different feel for sure with the reverse
undergrad<00:01:26.590> i'm<00:01:26.770> able<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.100> kind<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:28.290> over

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
undergrad i'm able to kind of over

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.030 
undergrad i'm able to kind of over
expose<00:01:29.800> my<00:01:30.100> image<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:31.240> foreground<00:01:32.040> create

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
expose my image in the foreground create

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.940 
expose my image in the foreground create
some<00:01:33.250> depth<00:01:33.660> just<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.780> straight<00:01:35.080> hard<00:01:35.350> step<00:01:35.680> I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
some depth just the straight hard step I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.800 
some depth just the straight hard step I
don't<00:01:36.910> have<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.180> effect<00:01:37.950> quite<00:01:38.950> as<00:01:39.130> much<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
don't have that effect quite as much so

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.180 
don't have that effect quite as much so
it<00:01:40.900> really<00:01:41.080> just<00:01:41.230> kind<00:01:41.440> of<00:01:41.500> depends<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.070> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
it really just kind of depends on the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.630 
it really just kind of depends on the
image<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:44.020> kind<00:01:44.230> of<00:01:44.370> moving<00:01:45.370> myself

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
image and I'm just kind of moving myself

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.900 
image and I'm just kind of moving myself
back<00:01:46.150> a<00:01:46.180> little<00:01:46.480> bit<00:01:46.690> so<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.700> little

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
back a little bit so I can get a little

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.800 
back a little bit so I can get a little
bit<00:01:49.120> more<00:01:49.270> compression<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.540> feel<00:01:52.750> like

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.800 

these<00:01:56.500> reeds<00:01:57.040> aren't<00:01:57.579> really<00:01:58.119> given<00:01:58.479> me<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
these reeds aren't really given me the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.179 
these reeds aren't really given me the
type<00:01:59.049> of<00:02:01.049> foreground<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.350> love<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.920> want<00:02:03.100> to

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
type of foreground I love you want to

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.399 
type of foreground I love you want to
make<00:02:03.310> sure<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.720> feels<00:02:04.990> like<00:02:05.229> you're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
make sure that it feels like you're

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.999 
make sure that it feels like you're
putting<00:02:05.619> this<00:02:05.799> stuff<00:02:06.009> in<00:02:06.189> on<00:02:06.340> purpose

putting this stuff in on purpose
otherwise<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.709> doesn't<00:02:12.099> look<00:02:12.220> right

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
to cruise into actually real quick

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.520 
to cruise into actually real quick
before<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.319> do<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:36.140> I'm<00:02:37.140> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.349> put<00:02:37.500> a

before we do that I'm going to put a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.100 
before we do that I'm going to put a
polarizer<00:02:38.130> on<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:39.510> going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> really<00:02:39.870> give

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
polarizer on it's going to really give

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.509 
polarizer on it's going to really give
us<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.319> different<00:02:40.650> image<00:02:40.830> it's<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> take

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
us a different image it's going to take

the<00:02:41.670> glare<00:02:43.459> off<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.819> river<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.300> here<00:02:49.130> you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the glare off the river right here you

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.009 
the glare off the river right here you
don't<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.430> too<00:02:50.640> long<00:02:50.880> before<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.569> Sun<00:02:51.810> hits

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
don't have too long before that Sun hits

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.630 
don't have too long before that Sun hits
the<00:02:52.080> piece<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.530> once<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.830> goes<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.220> goes<00:02:53.250> quick

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the piece and once it goes it goes quick

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.250 
the piece and once it goes it goes quick
and<00:02:53.700> what<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.030> found<00:02:54.330> while<00:02:54.600> I'm<00:02:54.720> shooting<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and what I found while I'm shooting is I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.229 
and what I found while I'm shooting is I
think<00:02:55.319> I'd<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.850> get<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.030> bit

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
think I'd like to get a little bit

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.780 
think I'd like to get a little bit
tighter<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.049> do<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> vertical<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:59.549> know<00:02:59.670> it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
tighter in and do a vertical you know it

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.420 
tighter in and do a vertical you know it
was<00:02:59.910> some<00:03:00.239> nice<00:03:00.500> dawn<00:03:01.500> glow<00:03:01.890> there<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
was some nice dawn glow there for a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.390 
was some nice dawn glow there for a
little<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.840> I'm<00:03:03.840> fairly<00:03:04.530> happy<00:03:04.709> with<00:03:05.100> those

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
little bit I'm fairly happy with those

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.259 
little bit I'm fairly happy with those
images<00:03:05.730> I'm<00:03:06.030> not<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.510> don't<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.230> they're<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
images I'm not I don't think they're the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.720 
images I'm not I don't think they're the
five-star<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.299> was<00:03:09.510> hoping<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.640> what<00:03:11.640> I'm

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
five-star I was hoping for but what I'm

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
five-star I was hoping for but what I'm
doing<00:03:11.970> right<00:03:12.120> now<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.750> know<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.260> when<00:03:13.799> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
doing right now is I know that when the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.270 
doing right now is I know that when the
light<00:03:14.099> hits<00:03:14.370> those<00:03:14.580> peaks<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> background

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
light hits those peaks in the background

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.160 
light hits those peaks in the background
it's<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.730> be<00:03:17.819> spectacular<00:03:18.170> and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it's really going to be spectacular and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.730 
it's really going to be spectacular and
go<00:03:19.380> ahead<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.709> throw<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.950> polarizer<00:03:20.459> on
