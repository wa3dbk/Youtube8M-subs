00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.740
 Today I want to show you how I am 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.270
 my hair set up my son and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.200
 Although we have a really big one 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.320
 problem he has a pretty strong 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.260
 book his hair and there are virtually 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 no gel or there is no money what it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
 ever could have done his hair more 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 as a minute to hold up 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.050
 we'll try this one today 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.369
 Product made that taffeta look before twelve 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.170
 power is often outdated speed gr 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.610
 this is supposed to be extremely fast 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.200
 dry and within seconds and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.660
 yes, let's take a look now 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.660
 if that works for him 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:06.240
 from the texture very steady we try 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.510
 the one I have here the times 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 bit of a 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.100
 So that was definitely not enough me 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 Then take a bit more 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.820
 do you want 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.570
 I do not know if that will last 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.570
 we'll see 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.500
 So of the texture is as I said 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.450
 very little very dry you dry that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.080
 maximum on the fingers quickly not in 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 the hair 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:20.830
 and yes I would say so we 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 look if it's still a bit 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.550
 dried 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.160
 So it stands now yes we have now 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:52.140
 additionally with a little brush 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:58.360
 fixed as I said it is still 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 We'll be two times three 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.160
 test times so far we are not very 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.380
 excited as I said it can be 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:12.420
 Still to do is still around 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:15.180
 is not dry and well our note 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.500
 thumbs down 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.500
 So then bye bye
