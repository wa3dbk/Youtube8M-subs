thing<00:02:23.160> i<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.700> UVO<00:02:24.120> system<00:02:24.150> that's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
thing i like is a UVO system that's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.840 
thing i like is a UVO system that's
their<00:02:24.990> inner<00:02:25.380> communication<00:02:26.220> system<00:02:26.670> much

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
their inner communication system much

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.369 
their inner communication system much
like<00:02:26.880> ford<00:02:27.330> sync<00:02:27.630> system<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> is

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
like ford sync system and it is

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.140 
like ford sync system and it is
developed<00:02:28.769> by<00:02:28.860> Microsoft<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.939> has<00:02:30.120> a

those<00:02:35.250> sorts<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.609> things<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.689> think

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
those sorts of things so I really think

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050 
those sorts of things so I really think
that<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.290> done<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:37.920> very<00:02:38.010> well<00:02:38.280> he<00:02:38.849> didn't

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
that is done very very well he didn't

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.209 
that is done very very well he didn't
cooled<00:02:39.299> seats<00:02:39.629> this<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.469> the<00:02:40.950> stuff<00:02:41.189> you

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
cooled seats this is like the stuff you

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.740 
cooled seats this is like the stuff you
would<00:02:41.400> never<00:02:41.519> get<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.939> compact<00:02:42.329> car<00:02:42.450> even

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
would never get in a compact car even

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.199 
would never get in a compact car even
just<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.079> few<00:02:43.319> years<00:02:43.530> ago<00:02:43.739> now<00:02:44.549> we<00:02:44.609> want<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> get

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
just a few years ago now we want to get

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.059 
just a few years ago now we want to get
to<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.719> that<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.049> car<00:02:46.290> steers<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.980> not

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
to the way that the car steers and not

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.280 
to the way that the car steers and not
being<00:02:47.219> a<00:02:47.280> big<00:02:47.430> complainer<00:02:47.849> about<00:02:48.569> hyundai<00:02:49.049> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
being a big complainer about hyundai and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.750 
being a big complainer about hyundai and
kia<00:02:49.349> products<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.250> past<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.639> their

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
kia products in the past with their

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.309 
kia products in the past with their
electric<00:02:51.090> power<00:02:51.269> steering<00:02:51.420> because<00:02:52.170> i<00:02:52.260> think

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
electric power steering because i think

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.709 
electric power steering because i think
they<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> dead-on<00:02:53.280> center<00:02:53.730> feel<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.450> car

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:54.719 
they have a dead-on center feel this car

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.479 
they have a dead-on center feel this car
feels<00:02:54.930> much<00:02:55.260> better<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.980> might<00:02:56.189> just<00:02:56.219> be

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
feels much better it might just be

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.220 
feels much better it might just be
because<00:02:56.609> it's<00:02:56.939> got<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.209> larger<00:02:57.569> 17-inch

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because it's got the larger 17-inch

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
because it's got the larger 17-inch
wheels<00:02:58.319> compared<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.159> smaller<00:02:59.459> base

wheel<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.719> also<00:03:00.959> has<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.530> flex<00:03:01.980> steer<00:03:02.250> option

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700

you<00:03:03.090> push<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.359> button<00:03:03.629> here<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.230> changes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
you push a button here and it changes

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.440 
you push a button here and it changes
the<00:03:04.799> weight<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.459> steering<00:03:05.909> that's<00:03:06.209> really

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the weight of the steering that's really

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.140 
the weight of the steering that's really
all<00:03:06.629> it<00:03:06.659> does<00:03:06.959> from<00:03:07.439> comfort<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.400> normal<00:03:08.819> to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
all it does from comfort to normal to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.599 
all it does from comfort to normal to
sport<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.049> get<00:03:10.319> on<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.590> engines<00:03:11.069> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
sport now we get on to the engines the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.849 
sport now we get on to the engines the
base<00:03:11.849> engine<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.359> being<00:03:12.569> carried<00:03:12.810> over<00:03:12.989> 148

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
base engine is being carried over 148

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.250 
base engine is being carried over 148
horsepower<00:03:13.889> it's<00:03:14.819> not<00:03:15.030> direct<00:03:15.540> injection<00:03:15.900> on

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
horsepower it's not direct injection on

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.289 
horsepower it's not direct injection on
that<00:03:16.560> motor<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.129> that's<00:03:17.549> for<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.849> base<00:03:18.030> car

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
that motor and that's for the base car

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.059 
that motor and that's for the base car
then<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.049> into<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.379> middle<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.739> upper

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
then you get into the middle and upper

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.250 
then you get into the middle and upper
trim<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.609> they've<00:03:20.760> dropped<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.419> a<00:03:21.599> two<00:03:22.019> liter

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
trim and they've dropped in a two liter

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.470 
trim and they've dropped in a two liter
version<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.919> the<00:03:23.040> same<00:03:23.219> engine<00:03:23.669> but<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:24.209> one

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
version of the same engine but with one

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.259 
version of the same engine but with one
big<00:03:24.510> difference<00:03:24.870> they've<00:03:25.829> slapped<00:03:26.219> on<00:03:26.519> direct

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
big difference they've slapped on direct

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.059 
big difference they've slapped on direct
injection<00:03:27.659> which<00:03:28.319> gets<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.709> greater

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
injection which gets you greater

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.459 
injection which gets you greater
throttle<00:03:29.519> response<00:03:29.700> better<00:03:30.569> efficiency<00:03:31.290> and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:31.469 
throttle response better efficiency and

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.459 
throttle response better efficiency and
more<00:03:32.010> power<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.909> we<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.120> from<00:03:33.439> 148<00:03:34.439> horsepower

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.469 
more power so we go from 148 horsepower

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.000 
more power so we go from 148 horsepower
with<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.159> 1.8<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.209> two-liter<00:03:36.419> into<00:03:37.010> 173

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
with a 1.8 to the two-liter into 173

horsepower and very good torque and
we've<00:03:40.470> been<00:03:40.590> driving<00:03:40.799> through<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.220> mountains

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
we've been driving through the mountains

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.000 
we've been driving through the mountains
