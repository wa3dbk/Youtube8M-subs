00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:11.559
 Hi there is a base based on how much today is a happy set toy 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.860
 70,000 from No. 9 by say that Part 2 of the Thomas the Tank Engine 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:19.350
 Yes, here's also I think that it would like to open 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 See you Let's break the mug bag 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.230
 In the direction of the bag and Canada 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:47.079
 A lot of it is similar to the last time after we put out from the direction of the purse black 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.790
 There is a sticker and I would like to paste this first 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:57.780
 I got the needle towards the Yes seal 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:05.820
 At first we think that we want to look at from this 7th Thomas mini-pen case 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 I pen case to 7 birds of Thomas Pi is a place that has been consolidated in the middle of here. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:20.160
 It's going to come off and it's a hollow inside of it's pen 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.760
 It's not deeper than you think do it and I think, but little is put 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.840
 I was following James No. 9 here 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.050
 I'm going to be a pencil 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.730
 The 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.900
 It's a little short pencil, but I can't judo if I try to store it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.210
 Why a 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:45.820
 It's impossible with this pencil, so I think it's a rather short guy 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.820
 I think I can not store it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 Why don't you just put in something small? 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:22.270
 I would like to continue looking at the Kobe Ale ruler number 8 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.950
 Here it is in addition to Kodon Well 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:30.990
 Ale is also on, this will be the top 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 Road to open this veil 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:43.260
 ï½°ï½°ï½°became a Yes ruler 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.260
 The memory is up to 20 cm, so you can plan for something a little larger 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.000
 I use it like this 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 You can also play, how many centimeters 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.610
 It also you can dampen the teeth to buy it many things turned into 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 Well 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.520
 I feel like an item that makes it a great bridge. 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.510
 And when you're done using it 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.930
 I have this chocolate back 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.709
 Here 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.540
 When it is inserted into the hole in the Godonoff lacquer 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.540
 Nor does it eliminate 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.710
 tan 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.190
 And the last 9 James 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.580
 Ear pencils and clips We introduced this one 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:48.790
 It becomes Aoya's pencil, but this is it 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.790
 Because there is space to store in the upper side 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:01.590
 This does not have that pencil of Sakitcho is or too long and the square 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.010
 It's amazing, it's the same color as Malta, so it's natural and cute. 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.060
 It is after 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.660
 To Urahaha 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.319
 Big 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.040
 There is a clip so this is 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.299
 Go play to narrow mother 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.209
 I get out of the ticket 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:27.630
 Two are attached It is using these two 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:34.449
 It seems that you can play a bit, but I would like to use the blue clip first 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:39.380
 The Maruki much less paper on it this because the surface is post assault 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:42.610
 I will put it and hold it down for a while 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.610
 Pencil and does 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.910
 ni 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.910
 Phew 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.139
 As you smoked a 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.590
 Yes, the meeting of the clip was projected to God 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.720
 One more yellow clip is after 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.550
 It's in the form of here oc 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.080
 This is it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.180
 Put it on paper 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.930
 A face with a pencil 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.930
 Follow me 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:38.360
 Yes 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:41.889
 Saying to do so can also be used as the click is the completion of the star to also, for example, when writing a 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:47.729
 As it is usable, it is quite convenient product 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.729
 Let's fix it without fishing when you finish using it 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.800
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.030
 No 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.630
 Hmm 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:14.029
 This is a happy set this time 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:17.689
 Become a throne of Thomas Thomas 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:21.020
 789 pieces were introduced 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:25.189
 Recommendation is the eighth Gordon 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.300
 This is a comment rating book if you are willing to become a veil castle silver 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.070
 I hope you like this 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.820
