get a battery box and you get a rudder

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.190 
get a battery box and you get a rudder
so<00:02:41.230> those<00:02:42.230> three<00:02:42.620> pieces<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.400> kind<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:44.200> what

so those three pieces are kind of what
comes<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.130> skew<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.880> book<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.690> you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
comes with the skew of this book if you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.220 
comes with the skew of this book if you
decide<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:49.310> men<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.790> men<00:02:49.940> code<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.360> motor<00:02:50.569> is
