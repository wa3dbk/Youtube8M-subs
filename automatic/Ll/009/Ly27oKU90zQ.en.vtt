00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 there is little pleasant coming in 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.000
 this is you it is an ion disappointing 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.190
 energy in van t you can freeze but the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.620
 would start start of the race 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.360
 go see the first first half hour 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.400
 yes we do not radiate that we 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.289
 want to win and that has got me 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.750
 very surprised 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.269
 you know the tricky away match is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.830
 space we are the how you do good good 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.119
 capable then 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 start was hard you knew it was your move 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.060
 you would be proverbial at the throat 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.140
 want to tackle also happen in the first 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 quarter 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
 yes and started better than us knew it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.149
 tried it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 agreed in advance to get through 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.270
 playing football but that didn't work out well 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.719
 enough were not good in the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.719
 organization 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.829
 yes then you don't need it that well either 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.430
 Roel in a number of phases came 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 al torino 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 but we could look in bowls 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 bringing very little also makes it the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.600
 need an extra finisher an extra 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.980
 clear 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.789
 no it is not so much that the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.719
 I don't worry about me forever 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.549
 players who are not there but this 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.110
 number but this team I am still there 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 always convinced 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.620
 can we just get az and that is that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.380
 failed 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.350
 at certain stages in the competitions yes 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.410
 then there have been quite moments 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.340
 the chances we had dsa it may 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.710
 Just two are two or two and stand and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 and pay attention to the moment 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.020
 with wine balance the 2nd half a year after 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.619
 then that can also be made in other choices 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.340
 to become 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.380
 it was a hundred people 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.080
 penalties you mary i can be honest 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.360
 say i can have one in china and brother 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.549
 therefore we lose, we overcome 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.580
 not this game i think it has 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.700
 more to do with the mine optics that we 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.800
 we have radiated too little ambition 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.630
 the mistake that we want to go 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.040
 I am number three hundred 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.840
 Percent chance we had 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.880
 which the normal by shooting now on 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.829
 weird ways that she didn't get back to her 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.299
 yes that's a shame but how do you score the goals 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.009
 giving away can do 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.179
 you notice for a moment about those opportunities 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.979
 that moment you have a real striker and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 real finish is missing 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.459
 check wine balance set team who 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.349
 can also deal well freely and that could 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.849
 good for the goal and also saying 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.620
 normally there is a script to 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.599
 and not now, but for two years 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.250
 where we have many options the second 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.390
 half to make 2 2 what also went one 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 bit in the air the exactly on it 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.970
 Once you back one goes on 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.769
 play 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
 you give the delaware yes that's right 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.580
 make right choice through fougerolles 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.660
 Jews hate hanging out and fisherman's office too 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.650
 deal with two the other but real 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.030
 midfielder 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.950
 it is so that you can penetrate into the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.650
 sixteen then oh god came to me with 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.120
 that debatable moment after and then yes then 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.250
 the roofline is very easy to have 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.180
 the goal against because if you doing hello day 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.040
 I'm not quite right 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.390
 you push you know you went on that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.250
 moment just started attacking 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.810
 defend it from an extra means 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.120
 butter 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.580
 but I don't think marcel is three 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
 passed 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.050
 Dante after the boil because I can do it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.410
 air to it after a pretty 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.330
 positive preparation yes of course 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.830
 is the lust and looked you know the burden 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.269
 to exclude is but what I say 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.709
 space v are the how you just got one here 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.650
 good standing rail is not successful 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.000
 but must is only the first game 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.410
 have him on to the next 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 the first losses are right here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.260
 I thought you could see one thing 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.819
 hold for years 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.230
 PSV was also defeated eleven years ago 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.180
 the first competition match in while 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.709
 they just champion and you win or 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.940
 You really won't lose this season 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.950
 one with that with the first law of 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.110
 season that's all 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.290
 the two see jules to them that is the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.549
 situation gpcr ambition that of bit one 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.120
 to become a champion 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.250
 well then every wash in that then 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.599
 yes who the this to press then the first 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.599
 win what's in my mind 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.930
 great next weekend a summer 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.930
 must go further
