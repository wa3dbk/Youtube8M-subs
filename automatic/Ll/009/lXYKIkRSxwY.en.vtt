00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.439
 hello friends in this opportunity 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.380
 I will show how to set the 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.509
 voice recognition to command 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 the team through voice and other functions 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:17.440
 more for that we will go to the control panel 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.300
 and if you do not see this, you can go to 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.450
 categories sure it appears to them as 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.240
 this good can go categories and with 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.480
 the great ones and look for recognition 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 voice 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.270
 double click 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.790
 for this we have to configure the type 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.240
 of microphone that we have desktop like 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.010
 be in my case as in my case it is 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.870
 desk 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.829
 Double click and desktop microphone 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 next next for this is me 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.030
 appears because I am using the field 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.690
 to study 8 therefore you are being 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.049
 using 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.350
 my microphone good the next and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.259
 finalize only law what is what 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.979
 tells them what they read and ready to start 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.170
 voice recognition for that too 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.509
 is going to ask for a configuration of the dni 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.650
 is set up so it can already 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.900
 can start 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.480
 and also in the most recommended for 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.120
 use speech recognition is the 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.170
 is to see the recognition tutorial 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.900
 voice comes in double click here it appears 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.960
 here you can command using the mouse 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.470
 of the little arrow or by voice in my case 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 I will do it by voice pakistan this next 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.479
 following 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.090
 following 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.940
 turn off the microphone 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.130
 following 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.420
 well this is what they can do here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.900
 you can dictation and commands work 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.550
 like windows everything here is very important 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.230
 to see it all the tutorial is not going to 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:16.820
 To last a long time is little and well, this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.370
 we will close because I already saw it 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.160
 tutorial so I'll give you a little 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.560
 demonstration of how they have to do 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.790
 this good technique up to manually 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.690
 configured overcoming and I start to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.690
 minimize this 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.210
 open team 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.340
 the big one 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 and documents 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
 documents 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 and images 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.600
 music 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.560
 music 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560
 videos 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.970
 and so you can see and show 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.110
 speech recognition 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 minimize that 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.060
 minimize this 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.060
 show voice recognition 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.880
 we deactivate it in a while and so can 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.220
 watch 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.830
 in the tutorial will show you all the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:29.240
 functions the commands also here 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.240
 can open double click on word 2013 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.420
 here as you can see can open as 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 these do not you minimize that 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.590
 minimize that 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.880
 and show numbers 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.060
 14 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.060
 to accept 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.370
 with friends 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.540
 in this opportunity 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.460
 I'm showing you how to set 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.769
 we deactivated them for a while and good 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.380
 so can you also dictate to 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.090
 team in the tutorial to teach everything 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.850
 widely any doubt in your 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.150

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.520
 I normal did not help them in all their 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.430
 configuration if you do not configure them 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.660
