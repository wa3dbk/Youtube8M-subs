00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
going up and we're going up that's

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
going up and we're going up that's
exactly<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.780> culture<00:00:59.870> try<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.929> women<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.819> play

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
exactly the culture try to women to play

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
exactly the culture try to women to play
so<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.690> today<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.470> possession<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.250> pot<00:01:05.489> well

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
so like today the possession of pot well

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
so like today the possession of pot well
much<00:01:06.950> should<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.070> target<00:01:08.659> possession<00:01:09.659> that's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
much should on target possession that's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950 
much should on target possession that's
tetra<00:01:10.860> play<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> coach<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
tetra play so that is what the coach you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.819 
tetra play so that is what the coach you
want<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:14.310> tell<00:01:14.850> us<00:01:14.899> so<00:01:15.899> no<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> hope<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
want to tell us so no I hope that we

want to tell us so no I hope that we
continue<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.579> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
continue so and I think that we are in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.130 
continue so and I think that we are in
the<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> open<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the right way to open to going up and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.190 
the right way to open to going up and
the<00:01:23.070> class<00:01:24.060> minutes<00:01:26.390> after<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.460> house

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
the class minutes after the house

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.560

refining Malaysia also better than the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109
