00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.929
 hello friends welcome again to me 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.110
 channel and ccoo days and thanks for watching my 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.530
 videos today I have a recipe for a 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 gel for the day is a moisturizing gel that 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.210
 it will serve us perfectly for 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.829
 apply it before makeup in addition to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.120
 give us a tensor effect on the skin that 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.940
 It will also help us to reduce 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.620
 wrinkles by natural ingredients 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.449
 that I always use for these recipes myself 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.300
 I hope they are easy to get 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.879
 all the ingredients and we're going to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.679
 use something that I do not know if it's going to be 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 so easy to get that they can 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:10.820
 find in health food stores 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.820
 this is called agar-agar 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.200
 and it 's a powder these are about when 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.869
 can see the dust but when we go 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 to respect it they will see sometimes they come or they 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.770
 in powder but that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.950
 It's a few long things because like 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 I say is a transparent alga that is used 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.600
 as a substitute for gelatin do not 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.790
 I can tell if they can use gelatin 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.890
 because I've never used it for these 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 preparations and neither consumption 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.630
 because gelatin is made from 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.510
 cartilages and often carries 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.700
 pig cartilage so for years 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.230
 I stopped eating pork I'm not 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.420
 vegetarian but the pig does not consume it 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.370
 so if you want you can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 use normal gelatin and I already 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.000
 count the results but do not 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.540
 I guarantee the same result as with the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.340
 agar-agar we will also use 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.690
 glycerin here I put it in this 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.860
 jar because it's easier for me 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.369
 serve it I have already measured the water of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.369
 roses 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.549
 and we are going to use this plant 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.159
 wonderful that is called aloe vera I do not 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.870
 I'm going to use my seedlings because it's 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.450
 so small I have a bigger one 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.890
 but I do not want to use it until 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.900
 spring because I do not want to happen 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.350
 nothing because it is already cold 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.160
 so I'm going to use gel 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.380
 the gel that he bought packed but how do you 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.620
 I say use if you have plants 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.040
 better to use the fresh plant because 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.050
 they have their properties completely alive 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 so these are the ingredients 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.710
 basic I was already missing we will use 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.750
 an infusion of green tea sometimes I 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.270
 they ask why I prepare the infusion 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.860
 with the leaves but perfectly 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.250
 you can use 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.500
 the green tea bag so let's go 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.520
 see the quantities and how are we going to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.520
 prepare this gel 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.330
 I just put this in the bathroom of Maria 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.100
 I was already boiling the water and I put the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.850
 now I am going to add the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 quarter teaspoon agar agar 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.310
 they have to do this while 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.910
 cold because yes no 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.370
 it will not dissolve well 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.530
 we are going to put it and we are going to let it 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.940
 it cooks 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.510
 and this is going to have a bit of 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.879
 patience 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.189
 should be made directly to the fire 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:51.790
 but there is very little quantity and try 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.560
 with your finger if the rose water with the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.190
 tea is very hot and when it is 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.069
 hot, let's put out the fire and 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.530
 remove it and let's take out the container 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.010
 of the mary's bath so that it does not follow 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 warming up 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.230
 Oh, I've already taken it from Maria's bath 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.859
 in the preparation of agar agar with the 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.709
 rose water and green tea before 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.880
 let it cool completely let's put 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.570
 the teaspoon of gel as I said 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.540
 you used your gel before 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.510
 when they have their aloe vera plant 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.419
 It is far better to buy a gel 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.760
 prepared many times from angels who 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.100
 they add other ingredients and those that 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.100
 least they have is aloe vera 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.699
 and we add the half teaspoon of 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.699
 glycerin 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.789
 the glycerin can get it in 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.789
 pharmacies 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.390
 also online 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.330
 we mix well all 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.010
 and then before it cools down what 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.890
 we can move to a small bottle similar to 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.850
 this one that has a little tip to make it 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.850
 much easier to apply 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.620
 I 'm going to put it in this container 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.620
 it's the jar 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.590
 of these 5 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.870
 for gels they come from wonders this is 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.860
 magician but as you said you are 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.820
 you can perfectly use a used one 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.820
 well washed 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.039
 we put them on and let them cool 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.349
 totally as I said they have to leave 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.119
 cool it and then store it in the 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.659
 fridge so that in the morning when it 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:21.959
 put it on that tensor effect on the 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.959
 skin 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.540
 once we have it 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:32.009
 we can 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:35.150
 apply it do not have to apply much 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:38.210
 but a few drops 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.010
 right now it was very good with this that I've 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.010
 put me right for the whole face 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:51.479
 they throw it out and then this is absorbed 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.289
 little by little as I say to me it happened to me 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.590
 hand 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:59.730
 and you will see on your skin 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.030
 this can be used by all kinds of 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:07.920
 people with oily skin 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:11.730
 dry normal mixed because it will give them the 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:15.390
 Hydration needed without giving more fat 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.990
 no problems of dryness good friends 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.730
 I hope you liked this recipe 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.490
 that when they use it, they tell me 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.250
 results and I hope they rejuvenate 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.090
 about 10 years so I'll see you in the 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.090
 next video 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.170
 m 

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.330
 yes
