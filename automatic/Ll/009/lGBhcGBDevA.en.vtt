hi this is Dewayne again and today I'd
like<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> talk<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.840> creep<00:00:04.170> chord

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
like to talk about the creep chord

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.400 
like to talk about the creep chord
progression<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.089> creep<00:00:06.450> chord<00:00:06.870> progression

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
progression the creep chord progression

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.740 
progression the creep chord progression
and<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.460> combined<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.090> often<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.540> with

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and it can be combined and often is with

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.419 
and it can be combined and often is with
other<00:00:10.050> kinds<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.500> chord<00:00:10.769> progressions<00:00:11.280> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
other kinds of chord progressions to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.249 
other kinds of chord progressions to
make<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> musical<00:00:12.150> house<00:00:12.389> last<00:00:12.690> time<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:13.049> talked

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
make a musical house last time we talked

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.580 
make a musical house last time we talked
about<00:00:13.410> musical<00:00:13.920> form<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:15.350> every<00:00:16.350> song

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
about musical form and how every song

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.160 
about musical form and how every song
has<00:00:16.830> different<00:00:17.279> rooms<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.539> musical<00:00:19.020> house

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
has different rooms in a musical house

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050 
has different rooms in a musical house
and<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.619> may<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.949> just<00:00:20.220> two<00:00:20.520> rooms<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:20.970> may

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and it may have just two rooms or may

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
and it may have just two rooms or may
have<00:00:21.180> three<00:00:21.449> men<00:00:21.720> four<00:00:22.050> could<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.039> any

have three men four could have any

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
have three men four could have any
number<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.420> they're<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.750> logically

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
number of but they're all logically

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.960 
number of but they're all logically
arranged<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> laid<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.699> once<00:00:26.880> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
arranged and laid out so once you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.779 
arranged and laid out so once you
understand<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.960> makes<00:00:28.199> sense<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.800> so

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
understand it it makes sense to you so

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.189 
understand it it makes sense to you so
today<00:00:30.029> we're<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> primary

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
today we're going to use the primary

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
today we're going to use the primary
chords<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.309> secondary<00:00:32.790> chords<00:00:33.149> but

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
chords in some secondary chords but

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.479 
chords in some secondary chords but
we're<00:00:33.420> also<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> creep<00:00:34.260> by<00:00:35.070> way<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
we're also going to creep by way of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
we're also going to creep by way of
those<00:00:35.640> diminished<00:00:36.120> 7th<00:00:36.480> chords<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> we

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
those diminished 7th chords that we

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
those diminished 7th chords that we
learned<00:00:37.170> earlier<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:38.460> you've<00:00:38.610> heard<00:00:38.820> songs

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
learned earlier if you've heard songs

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:50.799 
learned earlier if you've heard songs
that<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.600> this

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.010 

well<00:00:51.710> this<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.129> creep<00:00:52.600> from<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.719> major

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
well this is the creep from a major

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.830 
well this is the creep from a major
stable<00:00:54.500> cord<00:00:54.949> good<00:00:55.850> diminished<00:00:56.390> 7th<00:00:56.780> chord

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
stable cord good diminished 7th chord

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.220 
stable cord good diminished 7th chord
which<00:00:57.260> is<00:00:57.289> very<00:00:57.710> unstable<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:59.480> a<00:00:59.510> minor<00:00:59.809> chord

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
which is very unstable to a minor chord

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.100 
which is very unstable to a minor chord
which<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:01.100> stable<00:01:04.210> which<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:05.330> unstable<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.080> a

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
which is stable which is unstable to a

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.590 
which is stable which is unstable to a
minor<00:01:06.590> chord<00:01:06.920> which<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.159> stable<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.090> then

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
minor chord which is stable and then

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.280 
minor chord which is stable and then
typically<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> major<00:01:10.810> now<00:01:11.810> that's<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
typically to a major now that's the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.430 
typically to a major now that's the
first<00:01:12.530> section<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.009> a<00:01:13.070> song<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:15.350> can

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
first section of a song and you can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.810 
first section of a song and you can
probably<00:01:15.619> think<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.979> songs<00:01:16.250> like<00:01:16.549> that<00:01:16.580> I

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
probably think of songs like that I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.190 
probably think of songs like that I
can't<00:01:17.119> off<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.330> top<00:01:17.450> my<00:01:17.630> head<00:01:17.659> but<00:01:17.930> there's

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
can't off the top my head but there's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.139 
can't off the top my head but there's
many<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.530> them<00:01:18.680> let<00:01:19.250> me<00:01:19.280> let<00:01:19.580> me<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:19.670> play<00:01:19.970> one

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
many of them let me let me just play one

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:32.690 
many of them let me let me just play one
is<00:01:20.330> though<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.350> real<00:01:21.500> song

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.890 

let's<00:01:33.700> say<00:01:33.850> that's<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.180> first<00:01:34.510> room<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
let's say that's the first room of the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:47.240 
let's say that's the first room of the
house<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.620> now<00:01:36.010> we<00:01:36.070> go<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.600> next<00:01:37.900> room

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.780 

and<00:01:47.580> that's<00:01:47.940> just<00:01:48.150> using<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.660> four<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.020> five

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and that's just using one four and five

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
and that's just using one four and five
so<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.450> rooms<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.840> house

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so we have two rooms of house

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880 
so we have two rooms of house
the<00:01:52.650> first<00:01:53.190> room<00:01:53.900> called<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.440> second<00:01:55.770> room

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the first room called a the second room

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.250 
the first room called a the second room
called<00:01:56.190> B<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.780> either<00:01:57.900> go<00:01:58.110> into

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
called B and then we can either go into

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.050 
called B and then we can either go into
C<00:01:58.620> depending<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.280> song<00:01:59.550> or<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.880> can<00:01:59.970> go

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
C depending on the song or we can go

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.930 
C depending on the song or we can go
back<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.290> let's<00:02:01.560> let's<00:02:01.980> just<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.760> that's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
back to a so let's let's just say that's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.390 
back to a so let's let's just say that's
an<00:02:03.150> ABA<00:02:03.570> song<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.230> there's<00:02:04.350> lots<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.650> ABA<00:02:05.010> song

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
an ABA song and there's lots of ABA song

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:26.340 
an ABA song and there's lots of ABA song
so<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:05.910> gonna<00:02:06.060> play<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.330> again

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:41.520 

Pasteur's<00:02:27.350> again

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.050 

you've<00:02:42.530> heard<00:02:42.800> you've<00:02:43.070> all<00:02:43.250> heard<00:02:43.430> songs<00:02:43.790> like

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you've heard you've all heard songs like

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.270 
you've heard you've all heard songs like
that<00:02:44.090> okay<00:02:44.570> but<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.440> point<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.010> want<00:02:46.190> to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that okay but the point is you want to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.890 
that okay but the point is you want to
creep<00:02:46.640> from<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.360> stable<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> stable<00:02:52.900> you'll

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
creep from one stable to a stable you'll

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.630 
creep from one stable to a stable you'll
see<00:02:54.080> that<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.290> lot<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.650> music<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.310> want
