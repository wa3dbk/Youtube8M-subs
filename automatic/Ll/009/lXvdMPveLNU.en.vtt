exciting<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.390> different<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.019> that's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
exciting and different and that's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
exciting and different and that's
actually<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.700> contained

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
actually what I think was contained

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
actually what I think was contained
within<00:00:33.270> Mary<00:00:33.719> Portas<00:00:34.200> suggestions<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> today

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
within Mary Portas suggestions and today

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
within Mary Portas suggestions and today
we're<00:00:35.910> coming<00:00:36.149> back<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> whole<00:00:37.380> bunch<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
we're coming back with a whole bunch of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
we're coming back with a whole bunch of
additions<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.239> example<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.320> think

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
additions to that for example we think

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
additions to that for example we think
that<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> would<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.040> great<00:00:41.460> idea<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.120> not

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that it would be a great idea to not

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.150 
that it would be a great idea to not
just<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.110> initial<00:00:43.530> pilot<00:00:44.149> set<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> 12

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
just have this initial pilot set of 12

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.590 
just have this initial pilot set of 12
different<00:00:47.160> areas<00:00:47.610> joining<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> process

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
different areas joining in the process

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 
different areas joining in the process
pilots<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.469> today<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.010> announce<00:00:50.039> we're

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
