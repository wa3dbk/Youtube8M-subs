00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.860 
yeah I can only get the ak-47 black
laminate<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:55.550> fact<00:00:55.910> you're<00:00:56.059> new<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.630> actually

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
laminate in fact you're new to actually

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.290 
laminate in fact you're new to actually
make<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> profit<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:57.770> I<00:00:57.920> do<00:00:57.980> get<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.610> then

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
make a profit and if I do get that then

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.440 
make a profit and if I do get that then
I<00:00:59.480> make<00:01:00.050> ten<00:01:00.350> times<00:01:00.550> profit<00:01:01.550> basically<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:02.420> I

I make ten times profit basically so I
think<00:01:02.719> this<00:01:02.989> is<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.379> riskiest<00:01:03.680> contract<00:01:04.639> diet

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:04.999 
think this is the riskiest contract diet

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.569 
think this is the riskiest contract diet
