00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello to everyone so I wish you 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.960
 present a 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.900
 new small filter which in my opinion 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.810
 it's a real revolution 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.189
 this is the mini shekhar filter more 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.810
 manufactured by a firm 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.270
 American 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.500
 so it's a very versatile filter 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.090
 and ultra performing 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.630
 inside this filter there is a 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.790
 succession of microfiber tubes 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.809
 inspired dialysis systems that 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.210
 filter at height of 0.1 micron so 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.829
 it's very very very hungry it's more fine 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.420
 that most market references 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.929
 in terms of water filters so 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.589
 extremely powerful more and there 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:57.960
 I was really really surprised he 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.309
 a capacity of 375 thousand liters of water 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.699
 I repeat because it's necessarily 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.530
 I had to repeat 375 thousand 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.130
 liters of water so it's really a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.800
 extremely interesting filter while 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 small as you can see who 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.280
 in addition offers something 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.979
 absolutely brilliant 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 is that it is cleanable ie 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.930
 we are no longer in the filter 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.909
 fill the filter by the day the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.610
 filter that we will put in his kit 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.509
 help just in case we can really 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.729
 because it is cleanable washed away 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.869
 filter on tripe of several days 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.700
 so that's really something 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:49.040
 fundamental so at this end we 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.700
 have a screw that will us 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.410
 allow screw and filter on various 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 plastic bottle neck by 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.409
 example but also on this small 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.649
 pouch that comes with the filter 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.270
 so here's a little pouch thanks to 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.179
 which you can drink or fill 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.560
 another container 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.269
 on the other hand it is delivered of course 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.370
 with a straw 1 so we will be able 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:25.630
 drink right here in a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.630
 source or in a gourd or bottle 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.120
 it goes without saying that this filter is adaptable 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.549
 on the paul chaoul in the way the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.340
 simpler of the world pipe hoses so 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.680
 it's very very very classic and it's 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.260
 delivered finally and I 'll show you everything to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 the time with a syringe that I have 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.470
 previously filled with clean water that will 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.570
 allow to clean precisely this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.720
 filter so it's very very simple 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.560
 there I took the little one can get 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 to deliver with that I filled one screws the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.980
 filtered 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.019
 that's it and then we can filter by 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.180
 gravitation 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.549
 as you can see and if we 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.359
 needs more flow is 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.280
 can squeeze the pocket and increase the 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.739
 debit 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.260
 so it's easy to use 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.420
 hyper performing but good there in 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.780
 the occurrence hop we put the little 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.180
 plug it no longer flows so far 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.069
 nothing extraordinary so then a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.989
 once we have finished using this 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.079
 filter and here we will get to the phase of 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.079
 cleaning 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.650
 we take the syringe that we come 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:56.049
 insert on this side of the filter and we will 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.859
 push to clean it so many times 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:04.980
 as necessary 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:06.879
 so here is the cair more mini filter 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.129
 delivered with his water bag 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:15.699
 his sister cleaning year and her straw 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:18.789
 who really for about 10 euros of 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.370
 more than filters of this type very 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:28.060
 known on the market is really going really 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:32.380
 provide security longevity up 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.560
 there rarely matched so that's micro 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.380
 filter more shekhar a favorite 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.930
 it's also the one I'm going to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.300
 serve from now 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 when I'm going to go ultra light thank you 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.990
 to all salute
