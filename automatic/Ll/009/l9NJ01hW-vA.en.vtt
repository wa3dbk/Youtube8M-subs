 Hi everyone very much Hello evening 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:13.059
 Excuse me 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.059
 I 'm looking for something to do a little shopping with amazon and make a new video 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.660
 Everyone who bought has something you will understand 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.680
 It is imitation sword by any means 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.150

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.150
 Well let's raise a little 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.010
 I do not know what is entered yet 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 Do you know everyone has a Kenshin ? 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:44.180
 Back there the day is I bought this time the bar that has Kenshin 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:51.300
 This arrived in the bag but 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:55.090
 At first I bought a new bag, but the condition of the bag was a little bit scratched here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.480
 It's about the same time, I'll do 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.790
 There is no trauma, so 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.790
 I would like to open by solving the string 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.399
 Me too 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.400
 Because it does not have to see application to seriously low until there 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.390
 Such 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.690
 You don't know if the collar is somehow shaped 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.150
 The possession is such a feeling 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.250
 It is a reddish sheath but 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.250
 The part of the collar is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.829
 Hard to resignation Mount Fuji and the new is to dig

 It is short compared with a normal sword, please wait for a moment 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.650
 I think you have to have an ordinary sword 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.819

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.819
