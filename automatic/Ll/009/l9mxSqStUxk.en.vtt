00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.000
 Though it is not beautiful 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.510
 Well I guess I bought a jacket like this one in the room 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.220
 The 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.910
 Made-to-order production and limited analog board 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.380
 It is 4200 yen including tax 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:55.010
 It's expensive , but now it's sold out from the cut right now 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.350
 Because it also soars so I reserved for buying and bought 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.700
 it's beautiful 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.650

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.020
 I'm sorry 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.390
 The question of the god of the jacket inside is great, isn't it? 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.720
 I'm sorry 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.940

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.470
 Is it in the back it comes with the poster like a 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.740
 Wintering 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.810
 It has become one liner materials say credit 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.810
 I would like to read it slowly with words 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 Speaking of jazz America has a strong image called New York 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 In fact, in particular, quite European jazz 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:59.130
 It is tan to find but it is do seems pretty hot house also the Tteyuu jazz Nordic I 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 In this is I really care I Mortensen born Danish woman's own 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:09.569
 Could be Well this and it is very I'd already there is a single or album that say communication 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.830

 In birth is the same but I know Sweden are active in Denmark this 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.820
 The Shizeru storm Desuetto youtube Dechokochoko is Tan Hami to hear 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.740
 But it's almost like I listen for the first time, so I'm looking forward to it very much 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.740
 I think that I like to listen immediately 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.800
 Hmm 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.800
 Oh 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.490

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.580
 Good 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.410
 I asked 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.569
 Oh, this is- 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.210
 It is my second sister 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.840
 Great 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:14.440
 That the first clothes a two and a surface b faces a surface b surface 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.820
 Release of the album itself I was would be heard in the deliberations have also been released in a round 3 years ago 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.970
 Though it was 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:24.200
 There is, however lp of the time Well I guess I made to a group company of the disk union 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.590
 And the courage to go to the Fu who want to 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.330
 It is something that was nb and was released this time 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 I really wanted it to be good to start analog 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.269
 It about great it was Jacquet buy to me more but did you say was a little confidence 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.730
 There is 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.190
 The piano is called Rush Jansson, and I did n't know about nature again 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.300
 various 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:53.550
 It is said that it is a very popular person when you check it 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.810
 And if there's a rush yangson in it, there's no doubt it sounds pretty net 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.290
 Than I found 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.320
 I think I'm okay Archer, but I bought it 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.210
 It was a great piano according to reputation 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.020
 But I'm sorry I'm thinking this time 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:13.150
 Something like this is not great 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:18.040
 Or with the vocal by far amazing how the piano is by far wonderful 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:25.000
 say something I think I'd say Toka a then group Toka is good melody is good 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:28.010
 Above all six great it's a high overall point that so violence really not what 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.910
 Desua normal original recording area 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.690
 I thought it was my sister, I said cutting, I think the press was good too 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.810
 I suppose 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:43.280
 It was a very balanced sound and I could hear the drums and bass very well 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:48.000
 Trumpet that sort of I I I came also something violin cello from Asore 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.740
 Where was the effective performance on the other everywhere everywhere 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.760
 Of course I'm talking about Toshio 's vocal Shisel Storm here too, of course that song 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.010
 It's just wonderful 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.800
 It looks like this image is very like this, it is okay to think as the image 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.800
 Who sings that beautiful song with a sense of transparency 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.220
 that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.220
 It's so beautiful it 's really pretty 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:25.090
 Yes, it's a beautiful jacket and a great performance and a great recording 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:30.430
 We introduced the de-collection lullaby end of all uniform radula tone 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.540

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.639
 Please get it 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.969

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:44.469

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:44.469
