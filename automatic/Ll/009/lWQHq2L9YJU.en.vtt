presented internally I think very much
as<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.619> simple<00:01:56.100> cost<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.610> headcount<00:01:56.969> reduction

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
as a simple cost and headcount reduction

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
as a simple cost and headcount reduction
exercise<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.290> many<00:01:58.409> benefits<00:01:58.710> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
exercise there are many benefits so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.999 
exercise there are many benefits so
outsourcing<00:01:59.820> one<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> those<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.079> cost

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
outsourcing one of those is cost

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.090 
outsourcing one of those is cost
reduction<00:02:02.689> however<00:02:03.689> people<00:02:04.259> argue<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
reduction however people argue and I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.180 
reduction however people argue and I
think<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.549> some<00:02:05.719> validity<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
think with some validity that is not the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820 
think with some validity that is not the
biggest<00:02:08.640> benefit<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> value<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.649> me

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
biggest benefit really the value for me

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
biggest benefit really the value for me
and<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.610> lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> us<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.270> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and I think for a lot of us in this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.809 
and I think for a lot of us in this
