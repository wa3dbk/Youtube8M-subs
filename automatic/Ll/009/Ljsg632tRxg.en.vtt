00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.869
 and remakes at this point and all 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 They should know what a remake is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.270
 but anyway I will say what is a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.150
 remake in a few words is a new 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 version of a work but in this case I 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.410
 I mean the remakes of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 video games if those that every time 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.690
 they are becoming more and more common such 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.239
 like pokemon or mega ruby ​​sapphire alpha the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.670
 legend of zelda wind waker starfox h 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.580
 64 13 super mario 64 ds etc. good 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.199
 people greet you your beloved blue frog and 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.210
 today I bring you this video where 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.060
 I will talk about games that you need and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.729
 possibly I repeat possibly have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 a remake once made it clear that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 this is my opinion if you have a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.250
 different opinion I invite you to the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 Share below in the box 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 comments and in this video I'll only talk 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.850
 of games that have to do with the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 nintendo world and good before 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.869
 start the video I want to give you a warning 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.359
 and that's why he injured vedettes and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.690
 act ok not hahahahaha but already what 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.640
 I want to tell you that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.980
 from this moment I will have a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.440
 third avatar for videos that is 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.050
 we are now seeing this same good 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 already without further ado I hope you like it and 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.040
 let's go with the video 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.690
 one of the games that I would most like 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.000
 I had a remake and of course I have 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.580
 the hope that you have it is undoubtedly 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.610
 the super mario sunshine for the nintendo 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.280
 gamecube and if it sounds a bit crazy this 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.740
 but if the super Mario 64 had his remake 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.750
 because he would not have it if he was 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.540
 one of the great games of your console 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.119
 we have also seen more or less how 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.940
 would look city of the end or if this game 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.190
 had remake in super smash bros brawl 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.980
 and smash paraguay we can look at the city 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.830
 delfino graphically enhanced this 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 obviously it 's more noticeable in the smash 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.019
 but since it's just a scenario, it's not 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 100% of how it is in the original game 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.440
 one of the simple reasons I have 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.360
 to say that this game needs 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 remake is that many did not have the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.080
 opportunity to play this game and if 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.450
 Nintendo decided to take out the remake 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.670
 I would have many sales so before 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 mentioned and it would happen the same as with the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.260
 remake of the legend of zelda wind 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.269
 waker another reason is that nintendo does not 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.120
 has taken any Mario game as 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.640
 super mario galaxy it is true that we have 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.319
 a super mario 3d world but 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.600
 let's go back to see those games where 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.120
 explores let's go worlds we had fun 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.190
 happening the story and so on not that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.440
 now we only have a limited time 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.300
 to pass levels the places are very 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.250
 closed and that each time they are 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.410
 becoming more repetitive this is because 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.720
 what I would like this game to have 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 his remake although nintendo said that this 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.910
 2015 would not announce any new game of 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.459
 mario I hope to see super 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.850
 mario sunshine in hd or maybe just such 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.620
 time on a laptop if this game 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.330
 will come to have remake there is the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.970
 possibility that it is for the nintendo 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.010
 3ds since by implementing the new 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.160
 functions and buttons has compatibility 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.370
 with many games peace monster hunter 4 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.070
 ultimate but honestly I would like 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.440
 more see it in the willy since being a 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.640
 very colorful game would highlight more in the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.640
 wii for obvious reasons 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.350
 lately to nintendo and game freak them 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.540
 has taken to take out a game of pokemon 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.610
 every year and that does not bother me for 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.350
 nothing the last games that they took 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.420
 they were the remakes of the third 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.700
 generation whose I do not have because I am 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.890
 poor but I'm not so desperate for 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.900
 buy those that we say the third 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.790
 generation is the one I like the least and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.220
 Well the truth I prefer to wait for 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.620
 buy them as they come in way other 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.720
 games that interest me most but without 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.430
 get out of the topic pokémon games 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.500
 what you need and what I want you to have 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 remake are the diamond games and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.900
 pearl and I'm 100% sure that what 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.650
 they will pull out I have two great reasons for 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.580
 ask for the remakes of these games 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.580
 ace 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.960
 hahahaha ok no jokes the fourth 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.449
 generation is the one I liked the most 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.580
 because for me it is the region that has 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.710
 the most pokemon chingones of all and not 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.259
 that's why I want to see the region of 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.259
 but in three of its gyms the league 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.530
 pokemon and cynthia also what more 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.520
 I would like to see are the mega evolutions 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.580
 especially mega infernal 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.849
 someone said mega infernal no one 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.800
 now benteke you clog something I think 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.930
 me and I think it's obvious is that these 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.270
 games will be graphically superior to 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.639
 remakes of the third generation by 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.009
 the mere fact that the nintendo 3ds already 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.340
 will be in the market and as we know it is 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.470
 more powerful than the normal 3ds finally 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.630
 I would like more than anything to play again 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.729
 those 3d games since they were the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.620
 first ones that I played and their great story and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.930
 characters made me love these 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.330
 games more than others so if they come out 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.330
 I will not think twice to buy them 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.819
 finally I would like to talk about this 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.039
 game the legend of zelda by minis cat 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.289
 I consider it one of the best games 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.080
 of game boy advance and of course one 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.789
 of the best games in the zelda saga 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.039
 this game is so beautiful that just 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.840
 that's why I want a remake of this maybe 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.210
 take me for crazy but this game 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.030
 you need a remake your story is great 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.190
 his gameplay his soundtrack all though 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.740
 I see it very difficult for me to have a remake 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.810
 but as always I have hopes of 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.710
 I have it though as they say out there 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.710
 dreaming is free 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.910
 before finishing the video I would like 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.910
 say something something 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.380
 as many know the remake of improvements 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.380
 more already has release date 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.960
 and this video I had planned to do 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.380
 for a long time but for reasons 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.390
 new I did not do xd and was going to put the 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.250
 remake of improvements more than in this video 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.430
 but they announced it long before I 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.230
 I did another thing I want to say is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.630
 something that I have been seeing in several 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.270
 parts of facebook I do not know if many know 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.310
 that the game will be released for nintendo 3ds 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.620
 of xenoblade chronicles of the wild that 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.240
 will be exclusive of that console because in 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.280
 facebook there are many people complaining 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.260
 because the remake of this game has not 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.570
 changed nothing or the design of the 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.820
 characters or nothing just the graphics 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.760
 obviously but what people do not know 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.490
 is that this game is not a remake like 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.500
 they hear it is not a remake but a 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.260
 adaptation of the game so that only 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.200
 they pass the game from the wil to the new 3ds and 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.910
 it will look in 3d is everything and people who do not 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.460
 know this is he says he is not going to 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.770
 spend your money in a totally remake 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.600
 Fucked and then the truth bothered me 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.380
 much this and that's why I say it for the 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.380
 that they did not know 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.630
 good people here ends the first video 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.360
 of the year I hope you liked it 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.700
