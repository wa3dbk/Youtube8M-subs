seconds<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.220> increase<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> amount<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
seconds they increase the amount of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
seconds they increase the amount of
physical<00:01:12.060> damage<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.659> take<00:01:12.689> by<00:01:13.020> 40%<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
also when they land it will just do a OE

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
also when they land it will just do a OE
damage<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> everyone<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> tyre<00:01:16.979> room<00:01:17.250> but

damage to everyone in the tyre room but
it's<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.820> large<00:01:18.150> amount<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:18.780> need

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

don't have a stacking tank debuff for

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.470 
don't have a stacking tank debuff for
anything<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.239> that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
anything like that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.050 
anything like that
yeah<00:02:28.780> there's<00:02:29.500> not<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:29.769> any<00:02:29.980> major<00:02:30.280> big

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
yeah there's not really any major big

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.759 
yeah there's not really any major big
hits<00:02:31.329> coming<00:02:31.599> out<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.079> you<00:02:32.170> would<00:02:32.349> list<00:02:32.650> as

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
hits coming out so you would list as

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.500 
hits coming out so you would list as
little<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> only<00:02:33.489> time<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.939> would<00:02:34.030> use<00:02:34.269> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
little the only time you would use a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.330 
little the only time you would use a
damage<00:02:35.049> reduction<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.560> can<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.859> quite<00:02:36.040> hard<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
damage reduction it can be quite hard to

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
damage reduction it can be quite hard to
time<00:02:36.670> especially<00:02:36.909> because<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.540> suplexes<00:02:38.079> can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
time especially because the suplexes can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.410 
time especially because the suplexes can
be<00:02:38.409> a<00:02:38.439> little<00:02:38.769> unreliable<00:02:39.760> when<00:02:40.150> they're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
be a little unreliable when they're

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.569 
be a little unreliable when they're
actually<00:02:40.750> coming<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.799> if<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.129> are<00:02:42.310> picked

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
actually coming in so if you are picked

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.280

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
something quite important about these

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.600 
something quite important about these

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
of afk on them and just chain cast and

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.680 
of afk on them and just chain cast and
only<00:04:56.830> move<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> tiny<00:04:57.430> bit<00:04:57.820> just<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.300> avoid<00:04:58.480> one

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
only move a tiny bit just to avoid one

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.420 
only move a tiny bit just to avoid one
of<00:04:58.780> these<00:04:58.900> searing<00:04:59.230> plates<00:04:59.500> if<00:04:59.770> you're<00:05:00.100> stood

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
of these searing plates if you're stood

of these searing plates if you're stood
right<00:05:00.790> at<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.000> end<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.450> belt<00:05:01.630> where<00:05:01.900> it

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
right at the end of the belt where it

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.810 
right at the end of the belt where it
meets<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.500> walls<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.040> encounter<00:05:03.520> area

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
meets the walls of the encounter area

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.490 
meets the walls of the encounter area
there<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.240> actually<00:05:04.510> fire<00:05:04.810> spewing<00:05:05.260> out<00:05:05.440> of

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
there is actually fire spewing out of

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.590 
there is actually fire spewing out of
like<00:05:05.830> these<00:05:06.070> grates<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.910> stand<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.270> top<00:05:07.480> of

like these grates if you stand on top of

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.960 
like these grates if you stand on top of
it<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.840> course<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.170> take<00:05:08.350> damage<00:05:08.560> just<00:05:09.520> stand

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
it of course you take damage just stand

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.790 
it of course you take damage just stand
away<00:05:10.090> from<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.930> best<00:05:11.110> place<00:05:11.290> to<00:05:11.320> stand

possibly can and now also on these belts

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.950 
possibly can and now also on these belts
you<00:05:15.610> have<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.910> deal<00:05:16.090> with<00:05:16.240> these<00:05:16.330> stamping

presses that will crash down from the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.580 
presses that will crash down from the
roof<00:05:18.910> now<00:05:19.480> if<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.720> are<00:05:19.870> hit<00:05:20.050> by<00:05:20.080> these<00:05:20.320> you'll

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.710 
honest if you're not completely topped
off<00:05:24.070> it's<00:05:24.490> very<00:05:24.610> likely<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.240> you'll<00:05:25.510> just

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
off it's very likely that you'll just

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.960 
off it's very likely that you'll just
flat-out<00:05:26.020> die<00:05:26.530> now<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.220> first<00:05:27.460> few<00:05:27.640> pulls<00:05:27.850> on

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
flat-out die now the first few pulls on

flat-out die now the first few pulls on
this<00:05:28.060> fight<00:05:28.270> you'll<00:05:28.390> probably<00:05:28.570> think<00:05:28.870> that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
this fight you'll probably think that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.780 
this fight you'll probably think that
these<00:05:29.230> stamping<00:05:30.070> brushes<00:05:30.400> are<00:05:30.520> actually

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
these stamping brushes are actually

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.940 
these stamping brushes are actually
completely<00:05:31.150> random<00:05:31.630> or<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:32.260> they<00:05:32.380> only<00:05:32.620> land

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
completely random or that they only land

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
completely wrong these stamping presses

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.730 
completely wrong these stamping presses
have<00:05:37.120> set<00:05:37.450> patterns<00:05:37.870> there's<00:05:38.110> roughly<00:05:38.410> five

have set patterns there's roughly five

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.860

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.280 
patterns are the same every single time
however<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:43.180> order<00:05:43.420> in<00:05:43.660> which<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.960> patterns

perfectly you just need to learn every

single pattern and we're not going to

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.850 
single pattern and we're not going to
sit<00:05:54.880> here<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.150> explain<00:05:55.240> every<00:05:55.750> single<00:05:55.900> one<00:05:56.170> we

which will take you to a video where you
can<00:06:01.810> just<00:06:02.050> see<00:06:02.200> all<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.410> patterns<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:02.950> learn

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
can just see all the patterns and learn

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.890 
can just see all the patterns and learn
them<00:06:03.340> yourself<00:06:03.760> but<00:06:04.030> really<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.420> don't<00:06:04.630> need

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
them yourself but really you don't need

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.350 
them yourself but really you don't need
to<00:06:05.050> know<00:06:05.260> exactly<00:06:05.980> every<00:06:06.460> single<00:06:06.850> pattern<00:06:07.180> for

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
to know exactly every single pattern for

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.390 
to know exactly every single pattern for
this<00:06:07.450> boss<00:06:07.720> you<00:06:08.290> have<00:06:08.320> loads<00:06:08.740> of<00:06:08.890> time<00:06:08.980> to

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
this boss you have loads of time to

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
avoid these presses coming down you

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.130 
avoid these presses coming down you
really<00:06:11.980> just<00:06:12.370> move<00:06:12.970> from<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.420> white<00:06:14.020> on

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
really just move from the white on

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.750 
really just move from the white on
the<00:06:14.260> floor<00:06:14.410> because<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.070> big<00:06:15.250> things<00:06:15.550> gonna

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
the floor because the big things gonna

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.890 
the floor because the big things gonna
hit<00:06:15.910> you<00:06:16.000> in<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.210> face<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.720> you'll<00:06:16.810> be

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
hit you in the face and you'll be

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.930 
hit you in the face and you'll be
absolutely<00:06:17.020> fine<00:06:17.440> just<00:06:17.980> don't<00:06:18.520> be<00:06:18.670> too<00:06:18.910> greedy

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
don't think I'll just finish my cast

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.160

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
then move just move like there isn't a

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.750 
then move just move like there isn't a

the pop-tarts across the belt there's

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
the pop-tarts across the belt there's
not<00:06:42.040> really<00:06:42.160> anything<00:06:42.400> else<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.700> do<00:06:42.790> in<00:06:42.880> this

fight the bosses themselves are

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.480 
fight the bosses themselves are
incredibly<00:06:44.410> simple<00:06:44.680> especially<00:06:45.130> if<00:06:45.370> your

incredibly simple especially if your
