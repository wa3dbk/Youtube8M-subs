00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.110
 about U-20 which he was 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.309
 his first warm-up with this 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.840
 throughout europe and in usa by washington 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.820
 Actions 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.520
 this is the first goal value piece the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.440
 footwear brand 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.750
 entering end 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.750
 very good nights 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.390
 I do not know 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:50.210
 I wonder why it is difficult to have the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.710
 people who give us as well as we have the taking 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.960
 we are not what confuses you are 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.170
 where above but what about those who 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.170
 is it so 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.980
 worse if the technician on the line 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 the term that is coming that you spend 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.590
 then the center head goes away 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 and another 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.620
 played by the right they try to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.470
 center has the kids cut out that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.470
 you can look back or long pitch 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.729
 what is that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.000
 and a pitch of great distance to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.000
 the end 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.930
 and it's what's left 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.390
 defines very well are a greater arc than what 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.360
 I show 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.780
 they are all 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.780
 we know that the center-forward 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.399
 all these opportunities we saw fire 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.709
 henriquez 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.080
 then the center for ours the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.030
 ball goes away 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.640
 another chance to save my term and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 because I have it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.600
 for this shot that went down 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.620
 another chance to head escapes 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.930
 Jose Pena half and then easier for 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 the select coca cocaine that had entered 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.130
 the second part 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.250
 gave more arrival to the team as 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.940
 that we heard, I did not have the opportunity 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.940
 my government party
