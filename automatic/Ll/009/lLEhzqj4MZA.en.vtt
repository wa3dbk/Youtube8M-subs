 from our range 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.090

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.549
 half a meter deep and 3 meters deep and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.460
 since the anniversary year of last year 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.770
 dorema 25 years through hema we have him 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.130
 also made in a special version 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.460
 and anniversary edition 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.170
 in 2 meters 80 deep and yes it is a whole 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 beautiful model specific to this tent 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.950
 the print on the roof 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 on the inside of the roof looks 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.120
 very well cared for and luxurious from cheek 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.300
 we have a print on the outside 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.150
 of the material and since two years 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 we have a special coating on it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
 to let bring by cate allowing 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.510
 this tent a so-called 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.020
 the coating has a self-cleaning effect 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.050
 ensures that adhesion is much slower 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.160
 to it on to the fabric and with a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.620
 little rain it flows a lot from it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.780
 tent cloth and create as it were 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.340
 a kind of self-cleaning effect with this 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.320
 there is never one of those filthy ugly ones again 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.340
 spots on you on your awning after them 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 of course depends on where you 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.080
 state 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.000
 I mean, of course, you shouldn't go under 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.890
 a few trees go together with resin 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.500
 that they always look harmful and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.270
 annoying for a tent but these tents 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.330
 therefore has a much longer one 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.970
 shelf life and durability for the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.280
 camps caravan sure there yes well 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.910
 other things beautiful oak zipper and each other 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.080
 at this tent in the anniversary version 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.630
 we have added some extras 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.880
 namely window flaps we can do that 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.610
 okay show a model what what 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.240
 below is at hank pym and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.830
 also 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.500
 double anchor hooks giving you the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.480
 Mud flap so the lower plastic 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.760
 edges both to the inside 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.490
 knock away as to the outside 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.470
 because Dutch campers will throw 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.459
 will throw Germans inwards 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.170
 the outwardly 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.840
 don't ask me why because it is such 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 typical nuts yes in between if i like it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.070
 and I really conclude one 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.450
 quality product for the way we like it 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.900
 dorema are used to a very sharp one 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.610
 price 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.350
 yes yes this is in terms of price 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.630
 you really have a quality ratio here 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.860
 a super nice tent for a super 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.510
