00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 how many times we are used to seeing 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 final result to test is easy 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 for you because you were born so and velvety 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.789
 this thing happens when i have 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 started with will remain back at the beginning mi 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.890
 they made fun of everyone they said six 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 crazy I had to get what to do 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 but you are studying who makes you do it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.579
 to study all these fans work 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.719
 things together 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.200
 so at first they made fun of them 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.710
 of friends because it looked like a crazy farce 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.719
 who knows where he wanted to go 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 after two years when I returned to visit them 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.430
 because I lived outside the home at zero degrees 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.789
 you know what he said to me is easy for you 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:00.260
 talk think so that you got 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.789
 results and I said the girls arm 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.880
 exactly the opposite 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.150
 maybe got some results because 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 before holding them I thought is reasoned 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.200
 in certain terms you agree why 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.360
 the reverse procedure 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.090
 just that the phase part of the times ne 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.430
 we are more used to thinking it is easy 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 for him because he was born so hours he did 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.080
 in the michael nike advertisement 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.450
 jordan and pakistan where michael jordan 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.450
 after the races there was still one two three 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 hours to train and make basket and the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 most people think of renato 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.579
 so maybe it was born that way too but that one 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 competence what you dynamic that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.960
 what every day constancy strength e 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 the desire to do the same thing 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 what i work to you my advice is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.439
 this can improve the hundred look 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 day he said only that it is 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.460
 accustomed to speaking the master make a run 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.110
 because for years I no longer do sports 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 they asked me to do 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.469
 I make a kilometer days hypothesis of 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.170
 race they asked me to do it for 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.369
 a hundred more a day than scares 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.610
 because it is one kilometer long 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.050
 what is 10 meters if they asked me to do 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.599
 one hundred percent more me 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.400
 it would certainly frighten the series 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.260
 sky face one percent increase in 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 a little over three months reaches one hundred per 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.330
 percent more without even make me 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.800
 little step account also with the techniques 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.110
 Step by step 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.019
 small steps that bring you a big one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.489
 same difference these choose one 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.370
 race the one that is chosen the most 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.410
 become strong on that once 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.170
 that has become acquired what you do 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.700
 in the fact that the other nightlife used 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.050
 maybe the techniques at the beginning 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.940
 where you are weaker because if 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.400
 already remember well without one 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 useless thing saves technique used for i 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.040
 where you were a little easier 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.660
 aim where you need to improve 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 this I hope to improve not for 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.420
 hundred every day 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.440
 more and with this I show you the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:07.910
 video that beautiful
