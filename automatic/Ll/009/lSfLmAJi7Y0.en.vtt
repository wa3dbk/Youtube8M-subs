00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.680
 hello comrades what numbers nalut eros codes and others 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.540
 I'm the same yielded 0 0 1 and this time I want to tell you about the otaku 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.390
 yes and also from the assholes that criticize them let's start otakus have them 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.769
 tried on freaks weird morons and they've been told one other kind of 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.119
 expletives 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.509
 but in general I do not like stereotypes 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.400
 on the other hand 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 the normal of people tend to think that opaques are all the same 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.130
 It is not like this 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 first let's start from a base is not the same to see Japanese animation or anime 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.950
 to be an otaku 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.670
 second we define an otaku the word otaku is Japanese and it is to refer to 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.090
 the people that she likes anime a lot 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 I like we recognize an otaku 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.380
 have their own characteristics although we must emphasize that an otaku does not 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.560
 you must necessarily have them all 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.460
 they like the anime 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 they like japan very much their language and culture 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.560
 they love cats and many often use artificial ears of these animals and 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.650
 be in hats 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.090
 headbands or other elements 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.790
 often use bells as accessories 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.070
 either in the neck 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 as a bracelet in the backpacks 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.540
 cell phones and so on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.290
 it's normal to see them in massive events 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 the most popular of all the year is the anime expo 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 if you want to see all the opaque classes I'll talk about later 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.110
 that is the right place 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.240
 6 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 They use patches on their backpacks and clothes 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.010
 They use badges 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.100
 they usually prefer white black 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 pink and red 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 if you draw that anime style 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.340
 listen to anime music 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.970
 pop and jock 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.270
 finally we differentiate the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.400
 since people often say that they are all the same, which is not true 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.740
 we have the utah classic they usually like the anime and they feel something 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.200
 special for the old series 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 they investigate about the new 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.220
 they know all the terms and do not usually show their fanaticism with badges and 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 patches 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.469
 just some desserts 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 wallpapers on the computer and ringtones 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.999
 the otaku panama in the anime 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.239
 most use badges and patches to prove it 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.799
 some are so fanatical that they disguise themselves as their favorite characters 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.179
 cosplayer 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:26.509
 they sing their favorite songs and get very excited when talking about a series 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.419
 they usually listen to a lot of Japanese music 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.689
 They usually like cats and use bells and cat ears point inside 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.700
 of this group 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.649
 there are fans of different genres 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.309
 an example are the utah who love the yahud and man to man relationship and the 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.679
 south and female woman relationship the latter is not necessarily related to your 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.699
 sexual orientation 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:52.349
 Visual otaku often dress in black and like Japanese visual groups 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.209
 they dye their hair and wear contact lenses in colors and shapes 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.449
 common if they can 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.379
 Now that you know what an otaku is, I want to make something clear about your taco 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.619
 maybe they are pretty bad seen by following a different culture 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.399
 but let's not forget that we are in the middle of globalization 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.879
 they are not bad people and they do not hurt anyone with their likes 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.519
 perhaps society criticizes people who listen to French music or in 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.749
 English 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.829
 besides, it is not good to put them all in the same bag 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.319
 Many people tend to think that the opaque ones are doing a truck 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.979
 for life and making weird gestures 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.159
 or not all are that way 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.389
 not those who do that kind of thing are the minority 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.279
 so before prejudging a otaku better know the person well 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.930
 good and almost always those who criticize the utah are 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.610
 ignorant people who have nothing more to do than walk around fucking the mother 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.189
 with the same blowjob that the utah are black 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.379
 I want to tell those people that they stick a stick in the ass motherfuckers 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.729
 fuck assholes ball of badly caught animals 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.999
 good and I hope you liked this video about utah q do not forget 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.699
 put your valuable comments up bye bye
