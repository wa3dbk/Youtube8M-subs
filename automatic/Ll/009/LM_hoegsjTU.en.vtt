00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 Let's learn together at the beginning of Park Kyung c 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.330
 Oh skiing becomes difficult to progress the hood just let the Member States who have asked to very 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.719
 I have a lot of difficult code, so I can easily change it with c key. 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.010
 If a lot of difficult code comes out, Aizo is a high song. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:24.269
 Then the faith is only as playing acoustic guitar 1 is an equally original length 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 If you use it, it's too simple to mix a few rhymes with some easy mead 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.899
 I'll explain it to you in a few different ways. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.420
 The introduction of the song comes with a word of mouth that starts with 15 Casser 8 bar code 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.820
 That's the part. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 Ciel no a Minor examiner is fc Notis, that's you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 Next time I have to make the emily minor d - e c code longer. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 So let me give you a part of the song for the 8th song. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 That's true. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.700
 This does not exactly follow a written motion giving the bear down slowly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.680
 You give 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 For'm not going to become slowly but quickly tired of the atmosphere is also something new 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 Slow down and give me a word . 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:22.050
 Because there are two chords of a word, it is narrow one outside the robo board 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:28.010
 Give it to me Oh oh oh yeah own 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.010
 That 's right. 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:46.050
 Ah be here we go 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.050
 5 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.540
 We are now specializing in the area . 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.560
 Code 1 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.270
 This goes a long part of one rhythm Excuse 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.050
 It's like a four. It 's called a crescendo. 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.640
 Display 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 That's why to have you stand getting to play that burst through only to get off my down 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 Think you'll grow up on the 23L. 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.570
 Now the difficult part of Accord is coming out. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:28.150
 The bean curd is a dignity a miner, then a boiled capital 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:32.170
 a - Yes. Yes 4 Something code name is difficult. Drinking is complicated. 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.030
 Next to the main four-lead lead 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.080
 f # on-the- spot coating Next, 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.980
 This part of the code is difficult job that requires taking advantage of / and that is 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.060
 The reason you should keep the code alive / is that the other code after the alphabet 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.310
 If any further stated that it was not the alpha code that is behind 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:00.370
 I mean, it's a single line rate . 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:06.099
 If the sore-to-media, normal but do've joined the end of seven weeks # 54 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:12.190
 It's a sour liquor . 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:17.970
 The main four words are ours f4 BATTICS looks like Raffa # 2 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.970
 This will be a little lower me if exceeded lead 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.980
 Nowadays I keep gaboni order to do this, I feel let down progress servants 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.880
 You've used code execution like this. 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.319
 Play alive to this wil become part of the code it is difficult to slow down the left- 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.380
 Practice it. 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.430
 The right hand will make the next down to the next place. 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.370
 It's a rhythm. 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.370
 Please be careful of the accent. 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.630
 The next party is right. You can put that 1357 odd month theme set. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.140
 I think it will. 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.650
 If you see here , 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.480
 At first it was low 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.800
 U 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.819
 The loop is easy to do so even after a little shot 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.830
 Foot ditch next to the Fair last week wrote the seabed 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:19.720
 This week stop detection Shijo that Chu Shi Biao then 6 times a squatting flat lips 3 times 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:23.590
 The problem of color spreading is also complicated and then docked anywhere 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.850
 It works. 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.229
 It is not very moving, it is not moving very much. 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:39.340
 Next note # 5 4 - Seven can only push a few fingers. 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:45.490
 Give me the index finger on the spot . 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 Then decode it as usual, do not juggle it and press it all at once. 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.440
 press efs to work on Pasha of # 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.630
 9 That 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:05:00.550
 And then the f code is the same. 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:04.030
 d Minor comes out, but the second bar d Minor pants come out 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:10.420
 Outside of this 4 minutes of rice so short 1 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:15.400
 Which I'm going to place the eye over a long cord in g O to 4 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:31.300
 4 this portion's part to be gently switched to the atmosphere required that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:32.870
 So seconds 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 p 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:38.480
 U 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:42.830
 The other part is very difficult and difficult to divide the lower high notes 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:47.810
 Hitting the right-hand part, then / and books written on the left side that turns the low notes 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.500
 Stretch slowly and step by step the code so suddenly that the practice of both hands that shape 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.500
 Please do
