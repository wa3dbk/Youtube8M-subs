00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.679
 these midfielders

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 in January after 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.449
 go we believe that afp 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.589
 Swiss 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.819

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.069

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.179
 a little Serb no surprises 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.899
 he was wrong here 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 seeing this city 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.969
 I am really 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 there is no doubt that the bush species had to be 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.499
 that's what the first fear is coherent because it was me 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.249
 we are happy at all unique in the world 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.029
 hot 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.769
 3 4 5 6 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.339
 it's not that I'm really 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:56.509
 in terms of maximizing air 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.509
 therefore it is question 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.279
 the number of new cases 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.279
 quebec 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 she was deprived of her accounts 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.620
 I am think city in Cairo 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.459
 km 105 meters on a track more than ten points a dinner 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.669
 Fingers crossed 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.669
 I did it is 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.419
 coulthard 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.669
 this beauty election is great 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 more increases speed 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.789
 in his wake it's great for our next research with sync and 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.789
 Jacques delpla can lose weight 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.779
 so here I am really 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.120
 jean-pierre I'm against 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.140
 in the same spirit of unity and the contents of the chain because I'm going 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.620
 try to find a 1 cent a week that I could have 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.909
 more weight and 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.019
 and we'll see if I'm lucky or not, but by drowning 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.370
 already a lot 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.750

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.100
