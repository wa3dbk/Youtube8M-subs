00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.330
 because Peter thought Kruger planned specifically 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.349
 Samuel Koch was and continues to weaken as he could for the Franks 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.249
 was 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.249
 just 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.769
 about something similar truth 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:24.989
 Aalen 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.489
 easy to configure 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.519
 There is rain and he lends it 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.770
 yes I know Herbert first replace the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 No 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.050
 would have landed internationally 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.820
 Dr 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.090
 so to speak a connection created over the whole world or with BrÃ¼ckner 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.070
 to tear 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.600
 and other people 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.140
 can play 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.580
 the place just fed your breast 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.520
 around 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 Harald's first step is missing me pivotal point remains 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.490
 and there are no companies reached download 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 They turned red orange around and asked Murdoch for the pop-world download 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.950
 around 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.880
 the NNP light from my side we can also travel or 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.080
 Buoyancy of the ETA succeeded 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.530
 but I 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 that you are a stand-up paddling 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.550
 People today is the day of action 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.870
 on 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.310
 Install Denis couture freely negotiate 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.430
 m 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.639
 Clemens Prokop 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.789
 Propylaea 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.789
 szo 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.099
 she offers quite fast down 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.689
 the tie-in his black box on 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.059
 because the adapter Freya lent network connections 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.059
 but you can 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.879
 order the item Italy or install urgent 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 start in the core business mortgages today 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.089
 2 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:57.089
 I personally wanted to get a video clip 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:00.089
 and meet and finish 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.089
 so 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.149
 it has Detlev Prange Peter 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.129
 have parking this year 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.069
 Picture their reason 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.729
 a double-click or the death rate from the energy companies inherent in the system 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.969
 Now, let's go for this little of the chin tip here 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.259
 below then takes place in the lower area 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.709
 to put some of their accounts here 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.709
 Percent on the sentence Pedro resembled 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.900
 and that in the Leeraner Counter Kortner password yielded 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.609
 then let go 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.689
 a departure from the austerity program for incoming e-mails 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.249
 Posted 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.709
 and then rob them on the pay-tv market, so they would be contacted each year 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 because those probably from secondary schools and then it will be timely too 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.499
 So no money Henning Bleyl results come in that he is hasty 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.049
 and then Kellerkind enters 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
 it makes Sascha's weird sounds of time normal 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.399
 seen since the border opening 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:11.409
 so since he discovered here advent market good chances 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.949
 to push news about and so on 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.650
 so around 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.910
 The credit here is playing the different areas of 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.449
 during a year 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.180
 Nicole Kidman 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.650
 we want Kita and the shooter 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.590
 and 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.420
 yesterday Leterrier and just click a Greifswald he to the second page 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.110
 Ulrike Wejdling 10 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.759
 Goldschmidt the Coop to Dresden it is too loud his client has learned 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.629
 and no and 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.030
 permanent duplication of the network too 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.309
 9 to join packs 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.779
 So the match remained short so far Gladbeck Brad Bird Motorsport stepped 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.770
 countless in different varieties 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.110
 they can be individually 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.370
 more 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.370
 to minimize the loans 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.439
 and 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.900
 Activity Altenstadt just wanted to go account 4 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.050
 Wesener goes operational 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.960
 three and think so 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.259
 we have 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.259
 thanks to you the other people keep joining 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.699
 or he can 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.020
 the aftershocks 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.349
 knows what thank you for watching 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.979
 You can help a little bit for that 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.699
 and years you know nothing
