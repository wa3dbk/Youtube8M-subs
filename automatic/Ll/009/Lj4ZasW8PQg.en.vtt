you really have to make sure that you
have<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> filter<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.240> kit<00:01:21.479> does<00:01:21.509> come

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

suggest<00:02:23.580> them<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.270> beginner<00:02:24.600> tank<00:02:24.990> even

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
suggest them for a beginner tank even
