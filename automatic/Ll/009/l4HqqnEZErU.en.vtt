00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hi, guys, we're direct tankers. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.189
 here with a very interesting tip this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 It does not matter today. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.860
 let's open an email here on youtube 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 even down here has a text 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.869
 so here youtube rl cent of the most 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.730
 Let's then tap the word and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 note the copy and paste is already 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.640
 available 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 You do not have to hold for this a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.519
 tap a copied word and paste 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 lived 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.239
 you already have the option up here you can 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.250
 run 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.090
 select the entire sentence in this way 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 so here below copy I copied ready 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 It's in the system, I'm going to mine. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 message here has a message that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 was talking 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 then I will send to my colleague a 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.590
 touch instead of typing 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.270
 I speak the wii for example and have the option 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.270
 to paste here 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.420
 he put youtube he focused her 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.659
 everything that we had just 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 copy 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.140
 If I now want to destroy this change 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.750
 this text has option where to touch 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.689
 words and killing them one by one 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 for example san bruno i want to destroy 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.680
 bruno a little bruno I can copy 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.930
 the word bruno 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.189
 We just made or destroyed the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.979
 with a twist back on the backspacer here 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.420
 or else I can touch the word and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.329
 select exactly where you left off 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 destroy a whole sentence or more 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.579
 still if you want to change in the middle of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.009
 one word touch hold the course goes 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.950
 appear you can select exactly 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.270
 Where do you want to do your damage or your 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.270
 change 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.680
 this is very useful when you are in the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 device browser 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.399
 so let's go to internet explorer 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.799
 here you are in any website 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.590
 Do you want to change the address you are? 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.600
 you touch the address bar you 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 can do exactly what we did 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.940
 the touch and hold well in the middle course 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.310

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.510
 you can change the address of course 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.410
 also here in the ready corner and of course 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.630
 that the site does not exist is just a test that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.300
 we just did to show that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.430
 of course you can do all this 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 with copy paste and select in several 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.890
 parts of the system including bing 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.020
 if you hit the search here in the bar 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.930
 collar button is hidden here in the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.670
 corner 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.190
 We can paste that text in the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.130
 youtube it will search the address of the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.110
