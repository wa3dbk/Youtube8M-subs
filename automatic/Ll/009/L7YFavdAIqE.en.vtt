00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
machinery which we're going to be

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
machinery which we're going to be
driving<00:01:06.659> two<00:01:06.930> behemoths<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:07.650> thing<00:01:07.860> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
driving two behemoths other thing but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
driving two behemoths other thing but
what<00:01:08.820> I've<00:01:08.939> noticed<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what I've noticed is that these are the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
what I've noticed is that these are the
potatoes<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.890> grown<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.790> I've

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
potatoes that are grown what I've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.250 
potatoes that are grown what I've
noticed<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> graphics<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
noticed is that the graphics and the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
noticed is that the graphics and the
game<00:01:14.070> engine<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> exactly<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> same<00:01:15.390> pretty

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
game engine is exactly the same pretty

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.850 
game engine is exactly the same pretty
much<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.580> its<00:01:17.580> 2011<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> exactly<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
much as its 2011 like it's exactly the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.880 
much as its 2011 like it's exactly the
same<00:01:20.070> iphone<00:01:20.400> being<00:01:20.850> completely<00:01:21.210> new<00:01:21.450> engine

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
same iphone being completely new engine

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.560 
same iphone being completely new engine
unfortunately<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.360> we

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.370 
and now because all these things are
already<00:01:43.850> planted<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.780> all<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.110> have<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.230> do<00:01:45.350> is

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
already planted so all we have to do is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.770 
already planted so all we have to do is
harvest<00:01:45.830> them<00:01:45.950> up<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:47.270> automatically

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
harvest them up that automatically

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.950 
harvest them up that automatically
falling<00:01:48.260> into<00:01:48.530> our<00:01:48.710> container<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.510> settle

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
falling into our container we can settle

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.450 
falling into our container we can settle
a<00:01:51.080> cruise<00:01:51.350> control<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:51.980> we<00:01:52.100> they<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
a cruise control so we they have to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.540 
a cruise control so we they have to
drive<00:01:52.700> ourselves<00:01:54.250> everything<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.310> going<00:01:55.490> to

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
drive ourselves everything is going to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.340 
drive ourselves everything is going to
go<00:01:55.670> ahead<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.720> there<00:01:56.870> are<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.050> potatoes

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
go ahead and there are the potatoes

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.280 
go ahead and there are the potatoes
