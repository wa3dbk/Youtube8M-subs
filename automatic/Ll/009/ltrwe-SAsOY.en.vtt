00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.480 
villages I got three and it kind of
worked<00:01:30.700> faster<00:01:31.600> than<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.899> would<00:01:32.490> definitely

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
worked faster than it would definitely

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.510

would<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:34.140> three<00:01:35.140> times<00:01:35.350> faster<00:01:36.070> two<00:01:36.310> times

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.469 
would do three times faster two times
faster<00:01:36.700> actually<00:01:37.299> three<00:01:38.170> maybe<00:01:38.470> oh<00:01:39.479> well

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
faster actually three maybe oh well

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.649 
faster actually three maybe oh well
sometimes<00:01:41.340> faster<00:01:42.340> than<00:01:42.549> what<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.390> would<00:01:43.630> have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
sometimes faster than what it would have

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:54.539 
sometimes faster than what it would have
done<00:01:44.140> if<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:46.709> just<00:01:49.830> if<00:01:50.830> it<00:01:51.490> was<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:53.549> one
