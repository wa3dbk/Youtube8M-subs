00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
baseball but the RBI mean when he has a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.910 
baseball but the RBI mean when he has a
good<00:03:49.450> game<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.810> really<00:03:50.170> makes<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.620> makes<00:03:50.800> it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
good game you really makes it makes it

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.750 
good game you really makes it makes it
hard<00:03:51.040> when<00:03:51.130> you're<00:03:51.250> doing<00:03:51.430> something<00:03:51.520> well

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
hard when you're doing something well

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.370 
hard when you're doing something well
the<00:03:51.880> team<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:52.630> all<00:03:52.990> come<00:03:53.050> together

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
the team and it will all come together

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.350 
the team and it will all come together
and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.640> he<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:54.940> definitely<00:03:55.090> do

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
and I think that he can definitely do

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.699 
and I think that he can definitely do
that<00:03:55.390> by<00:03:55.660> ain't<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.020> group<00:03:56.200> Rome<00:03:56.380> which<00:03:56.560> is

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
that by ain't in group Rome which is

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.380 
that by ain't in group Rome which is
always<00:03:56.920> good<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.910> think<00:03:57.940> he's<00:03:58.209> been

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
always good and I think he's been

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.300 
always good and I think he's been
injured<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:59.200> don't<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.830> don't<00:03:59.890> know<00:04:00.130> haven't

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
injured for I don't I don't know haven't

reread<00:04:00.790> into<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.300> don't<00:04:01.480> think<00:04:01.660> he'd

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
reread into it but I don't think he'd

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.040 
reread into it but I don't think he'd
been<00:04:01.930> injured<00:04:02.170> in<00:04:02.400> his<00:04:03.400> career<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:03.970> yeah<00:04:04.300> so

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
far so that's good and then yeah so

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.220 
far so that's good and then yeah so

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
reason I want to do an awesome

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.230 
reason I want to do an awesome
apparently<00:04:33.640> because<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:33.970> want<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.120> get

apparently because you want to get
played<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:35.530> reason<00:04:35.680> we've<00:04:36.160> got<00:04:36.280> a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
played and the reason we've got a

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.860 
played and the reason we've got a
reputation<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.970> bringing<00:04:37.450> young<00:04:37.600> players

appealing for young players I know this

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.260 
appealing for young players I know this

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.970 
awesome and yeah I'm Randy sort of
scientist<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.660> developed<00:04:46.960> quite<00:04:47.230> loner<00:04:47.530> so

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
scientist of a developed quite loner so

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.380 
scientist of a developed quite loner so
I<00:04:48.010> think<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.580> lot<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.730> young<00:04:48.910> players<00:04:49.060> when<00:04:49.360> I

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
I think a lot of young players when I

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.120 
I think a lot of young players when I
come<00:04:49.600> for<00:04:49.750> us<00:04:49.810> when<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:50.080> develop<00:04:50.470> whether

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
come for us when we develop whether

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.470 
come for us when we develop whether
that's<00:04:51.310> because<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.610> want<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:51.790> move<00:04:51.940> on<00:04:52.060> her

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
that's because I want to move on her

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.350 
that's because I want to move on her
later<00:04:52.750> on<00:04:52.990> Necker<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:54.000> probably<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.150> too

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
later on Necker it probably is too

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.080 
later on Necker it probably is too
honest<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:56.040> right<00:04:57.040> now<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.250> know<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.490> we<00:04:57.580> can

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
honest but right now you know if we can

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.880 
honest but right now you know if we can
get<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.240> good<00:04:58.420> player<00:04:58.510> out<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.650> that's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
get a good player out of it and that's

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.150 
get a good player out of it and that's
what<00:05:00.040> matters<00:05:00.250> for<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.030> time<00:05:01.210> being<00:05:01.419> and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
what matters for the time being and

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.200 
what matters for the time being and
maybe<00:05:03.160> if<00:05:03.310> we<00:05:03.430> win<00:05:03.550> some<00:05:03.730> stuff<00:05:03.940> with<00:05:04.060> them

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
maybe if we win some stuff with them

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.690 
maybe if we win some stuff with them
they'll<00:05:04.390> she<00:05:04.870> stay<00:05:05.050> but<00:05:06.010> anyway<00:05:06.250> that's

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
they'll she stay but anyway that's

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.870 
they'll she stay but anyway that's
another<00:05:06.940> story<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.840> then<00:05:08.669> yeah<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.700> mean

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
another story and then yeah I mean

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.610 
another story and then yeah I mean
that's<00:05:10.210> pretty<00:05:10.600> much<00:05:10.780> we'll<00:05:10.960> talk<00:05:11.230> about<00:05:11.350> but

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that's pretty much we'll talk about but

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.280 
that's pretty much we'll talk about but
yet<00:05:11.919> when<00:05:12.400> his<00:05:12.520> third<00:05:12.700> reason<00:05:12.910> he<00:05:13.270> is<00:05:13.690> a<00:05:13.720> really

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
yet when his third reason he is a really

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.870 
yet when his third reason he is a really
keen<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.500> go<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:14.770> hospital<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.490> he<00:05:15.550> looks<00:05:15.730> like

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
keen to go in hospital and he looks like

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.460 
keen to go in hospital and he looks like
he<00:05:16.030> definitely<00:05:16.270> was<00:05:16.450> joint<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.780> know<00:05:16.840> he<00:05:17.020> did<00:05:17.200> he

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
he definitely was joint I know he did he

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.770 
he definitely was joint I know he did he
did<00:05:17.650> say<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.160> pool<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> day<00:05:19.180> like<00:05:19.419> to<00:05:19.600> stay

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
did say in a pool a day like to stay

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.690 
did say in a pool a day like to stay
itself<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:20.440> little<00:05:20.620> while<00:05:20.770> before<00:05:20.950> he<00:05:21.280> moved<00:05:21.490> on

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
itself a little while before he moved on

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.810 
itself a little while before he moved on
but<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.860> think<00:05:23.860> because<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.220> if<00:05:24.490> he<00:05:24.610> wants<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
but I think because it if he wants to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.430 
but I think because it if he wants to
develop<00:05:25.030> as<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.300> player<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:25.780> think<00:05:26.200> he<00:05:26.290> can

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
develop as a player I think he can

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.870 
develop as a player I think he can
definitely<00:05:26.560> do<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:26.860> store<00:05:27.370> when<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:27.520> think<00:05:27.730> he

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
definitely do a store when I think he

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.180 
definitely do a store when I think he
knows<00:05:28.030> he<00:05:28.210> can<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.510> go<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.810> then<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:29.770> do<00:05:29.890> think

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
knows he can and go and then I do think

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.700 
knows he can and go and then I do think
he<00:05:30.280> can<00:05:30.430> handle<00:05:30.520> himself<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.210> pony<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.900> I

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
he can handle himself in a pony and I

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.469 
he can handle himself in a pony and I
just<00:05:32.919> say<00:05:32.979> that<00:05:33.160> space<00:05:33.790> be<00:05:34.030> always<00:05:34.150> actually

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
just say that space be always actually

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.120 
just say that space be always actually
quite<00:05:34.600> physically<00:05:35.110> as<00:05:35.290> well<00:05:35.320> just<00:05:35.830> like<00:05:36.010> the
