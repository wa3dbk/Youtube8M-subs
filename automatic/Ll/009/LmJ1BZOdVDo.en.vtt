the elixir and you know the goal loot
most<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> times<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:05.369> most

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
most of the times and pretty much most

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.510 
most of the times and pretty much most
of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> times<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.229> gets

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
of the times you can see that it gets

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.620 
of the times you can see that it gets
you<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.640> majority<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> page<00:01:09.619> base<00:01:11.630> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you know majority of the page base you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.140 
you know majority of the page base you
can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.439> most<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> base<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
can see that most of the base and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.820 
can see that most of the base and
hundred<00:01:15.630> percent<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> base<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.619> already

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hundred percent of the base is already

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.230 
hundred percent of the base is already
destroyed<00:01:17.570> but<00:01:18.570> sometimes<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
destroyed but sometimes you know if the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
destroyed but sometimes you know if the
base<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.450> quite<00:01:21.930> strong<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.799> might<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.100> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
base is quite strong it might not be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840 
base is quite strong it might not be
possible<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.799> least<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
possible to do that but at least you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
possible to do that but at least you
know<00:01:27.000> most<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> majority<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> base

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
know most of the majority of the base

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
know most of the majority of the base
would<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.700> destroyed<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.990> we

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
would still be destroyed and you know we

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
would still be destroyed and you know we
should<00:01:31.350> still<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.430> amount<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
should still have good amount of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.679 
should still have good amount of
trophies<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
trophies so right now as we can see the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
trophies so right now as we can see the
Hawks<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.170> done<00:01:40.350> its<00:01:40.530> job<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.280> pretty<00:01:41.880> much

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
Hawks have done its job but pretty much

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
Hawks have done its job but pretty much
they<00:01:42.329> could<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.630> take<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
they could not take out most of the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.300 
they could not take out most of the
defense's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.970> bit<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> Defense's

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
defense's a little bit of Defense's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
defense's a little bit of Defense's
that's<00:01:47.310> fine<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.850> okay<00:01:48.180> since<00:01:48.540> anyway<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's fine it's okay since anyway I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
that's fine it's okay since anyway I
have<00:01:50.189> received<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:51.030> than<00:01:51.090> fifty<00:01:51.600> percent

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
have received more than fifty percent

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.429 
have received more than fifty percent
and<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.670> should<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> negative<00:01:54.899> on

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and so that should not be a negative on

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.340 
and so that should not be a negative on
trophies<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:57.509> should<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.939> pretty<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.350> I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
trophies that should be pretty good I'm

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.560 
trophies that should be pretty good I'm
hoping<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.430> Wizards<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.329> take

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
hoping that the Wizards will just take

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.800 
hoping that the Wizards will just take
out<00:02:03.810> the
