00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.100
 the past the groups then you that 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.600
 I got here was working, did not see 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.590
 the way again how will the eight 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.360
 groups in the cup 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.639
 come on the group a is the brazil group 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:20.430
 brazil croatia mexico and prawns go 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.689
 pass the ball and nine points there almost 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.509
 neighbor bahrain molezinha for you 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:30.849
 looking at the three games I have 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.970
 Leandrinho and play I think the following I 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:38.800
 I think this group is not easy and 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.140
 It's also not hard is a group I've never seen 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.760
 that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.640
 the average cheer Sergio Oeda murilo too 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.930
 hit a wall is that Brazil becomes the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.790
 win the three games 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 I think Brazil is going here doing 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.520
 hundred percent but it's not an easy group 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.780
 How's ours is not a difficult group. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.620
 how is the average germany gets these 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 groups that Norway is easy on the second 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.880
 will go down if she does not walk but she has 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 to battle the team that will play it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.800
 for example the coup of 2006 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.010
 which was croatia australia and japan is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.290
 similar was 94 was russia shrimps and it is 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.240
 a tit does not make Brazil stay 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.150
 playing games will complicate 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.150
 the second is difficult is not a group that 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.530
 requires attention on brazil play with 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.100
 attention won the three games wins the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.590
 three games so I guess that's just me 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.680
 I would say that Brazil play inattentive wins 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.200
 do not know do not know if will play says 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.240
 attentive betancourt also something very easy 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.659
 Now, who do you want to talk to? 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.159
 Brazil, this is a very difficult question. 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.140
 because the other three also 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.840
 balanced between 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.060
 It's a clear favoritism group Brazil 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.670
 took also balanced 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.549
 Croatia is what is perhaps the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.679
 best team but debut against Brazil 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.359
 weeks the kit does not know how it will work 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.129
 the mexico 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:15.020
 The people of Mexico come in a moment 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.970
 terrible but we can not fool ourselves 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.770
 The Mexico that will come to Brazil will be the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.490
 who shamed the tie not 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.180
 going to be going to be a more solid team 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.180
 mainly from the point of view 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.240
 defender ooo miguel herrera who is the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.240
 technician from america gets to put several 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.390
 times there five back playing there in 153 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.640
 21 541 then you will get a very 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.980
 I liked much more balanced 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.100
 mainly defensively and the team 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.290
 of shrimp he and me are the weakest 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
 of the group because the shrimp team he 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.750
 have and front only that it does not have a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.280
 problem the good hotel only makes goals is the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.440
 My ball is right there. 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.800
 There's no way the ball can float now. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.220
 get on a magic carpet and fell on the hook 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.410
 so that the striker 18 in 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.950
 any hawk centered if the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.980
 Ball you there itu did not tell me no 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.990
 No, you 're not wrong. 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 the attacking messi he can come in the middle 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.570
 field and play dribble ball 236 so good 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.180
 the euro does not do that, it still needs 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.190
 will talk about the catch okay but then 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.410
 He has to take the ball to him. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.520
 the return will do this and the prawns 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 does not have this 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.020
 prawns came to play in the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.200
 round with four wheels with 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.870
 four midfield flyers then it is 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.120
 For me it is weaker now it covers step 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 to stay on the wall for me to mexico 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.560
 and your desire to play normally to me 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.840
 with the wicks for me the crust 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.900
 pass next elections and junior cheer 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.900
 of vaseline with the 32 selections 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.420
 I ended up running in opinion with 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.420
 information easier efe
