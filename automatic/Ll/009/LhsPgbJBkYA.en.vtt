the Phrygian scale actually this is that
region<00:00:20.360> still<00:00:20.570> part<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.110> lesson<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:22.060> today<00:00:23.060> we

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
region still part to lesson and today we

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.470 
region still part to lesson and today we
will<00:00:23.930> start<00:00:24.470> applying<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.849> Phrygian<00:00:26.450> scale

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
will start applying the Phrygian scale

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.740 
will start applying the Phrygian scale
so<00:00:27.320> I<00:00:27.680> will<00:00:28.220> put<00:00:28.910> a<00:00:29.090> backing<00:00:29.300> track<00:00:29.449> on<00:00:29.720> my

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
so I will put a backing track on my

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.229 
so I will put a backing track on my
computer<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.740> will<00:00:30.949> play<00:00:31.220> over<00:00:32.000> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
computer and I will play over the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.910 
computer and I will play over the
backing<00:00:32.540> track<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.530> Phrygian<00:00:34.489> scale<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:35.920> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
backing track the Phrygian scale so the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.010 
backing track the Phrygian scale so the
scale<00:00:37.580> that<00:00:37.730> women<00:00:38.090> like<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:38.330> day<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.840> root

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
scale that women like this day the root

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.369 
scale that women like this day the root
is<00:00:39.230> G<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.070> when<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.370> play<00:00:40.610> G<00:00:41.000> Phrygian<00:00:41.629> scale<00:00:41.660> we

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
is G so when I play G Phrygian scale we

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.710 
is G so when I play G Phrygian scale we
want<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.620> play<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:43.010> box<00:00:43.399> number<00:00:43.820> one<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:44.540> can

always<00:03:47.730> keep<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.689> route<00:03:48.810> route

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.100 

so<00:04:48.940> here<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.930> have<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.710> root<00:04:50.890> G<00:04:51.330> here<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.660> 15th

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so here I have the root G here the 15th

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.040 
so here I have the root G here the 15th
fret<00:04:53.230> of<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.530> low<00:04:53.650> string<00:04:54.130> on<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.330> 17th<00:04:55.840> fret

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
fret of the low string on the 17th fret

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.920 
fret of the low string on the 17th fret
on<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.290> D<00:04:56.500> string<00:04:56.670> another<00:04:57.670> 15<00:04:58.480> fret<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.900> the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
on the D string another 15 fret of the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.490 
on the D string another 15 fret of the
top<00:04:59.320> string<00:04:59.620> so<00:05:00.550> I'm<00:05:00.820> always<00:05:01.350> targeting<00:05:02.350> the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
top string so I'm always targeting the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.600 
top string so I'm always targeting the
roots<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.130> they're<00:05:03.430> flat<00:05:03.700> too<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:08.400> with<00:05:09.400> this

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
roots and they're flat too so with this

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.120 
roots and they're flat too so with this
way<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:10.090> easier<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:11.260> know<00:05:11.380> be<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:11.890> the
