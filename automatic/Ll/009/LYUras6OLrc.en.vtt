00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.790
 shines javier hernandez and what you 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.519
 it said it makes a difference because it was 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.700
 very dynamic does not revolutionize the attack 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.040
 Real Madrid and how well you have a lot 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.450
 competition and took advantage of the moment that 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.800
 have to do it the numbers leave 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.859
 Hernandez endorses it and we'll see more 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.340
 forward but it is certainly a player who 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.470
 has had the virtue of being blunt 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.750
 minutes very few minutes for the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.170
 peas but the chichero responds with 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.760
 many goals there are pea haters that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 they hate javier hernández that maybe 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.329
 they are not compatible by the numbers there 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.370
 it shows us the things these are the 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.350
 numbers in champions league 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.360
 in this man they say in this edition 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.460
 with real madrid and now I 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 I would ask how they would like you 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.090
 put the ball 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.949
 the toxic that we saw of the blows that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.280
 has everything of all manufacturing 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.369
 inclusive 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.320
 very unorthodox what is to qualify 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.780
 well but it's the style of javier said it 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.700
 also mid-week carnet ancelotti 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 that has suffered a lot javier great 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.450
 and at the end of the game he also said it and 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.090
 that is a great player a lot of delivery 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.979
 here we also see the confidence that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 has in spite of the few minutes and that 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.729
 he even said he was a little fed up 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 of this situation but javi hernandez 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.119
 is to be a starter on a team like 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 Real Madrid will reach Javier 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 to shine you have to remember that 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.610
 still manchester hypertension and that 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.070
 There is an option to buy with performances 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.330
 like today, I think he gives his case to 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.700
 power if you know that here I am 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.470
 I'm not a spare but I can be 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.929
 also a player who marks the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.960
 difference at the end of accounts does the 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.929
 goal and had to put several not here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.250
 you will really find a great defense 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.869
 It gives you the opportunity because 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.580
 absences injuries play in your favor 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.830
 not mainly 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 benzema but the truth is that I think 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 that could be a player 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.950
 the attack leads the uncomfortable one very much 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.180
 and the truth is that he played very well 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.670
 one of the two most important power plants 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.110
 of football globally nothing more and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 nothing less than Diego has the Uruguayan and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.520
 I look at the Brazilian but a couple 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 from central for what is coming to the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.930
 Mexican selection Javier should look 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.670
 other destination we know that the real madrid 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.380
 there will always be competition and there will be 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 a karim benzema and you can get another 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.150
 Falcao the name you tell me but it's 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.580
 to accept in Madrid then it suits you 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
 better to javier and that other team and have 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.150
 rather 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 from my perspective I think well 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.330
 coincides a little with louis in terms of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.240
 that with the performance today I think 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.580
 that has already earned the silent mouths by 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.110
 at least I have kept my mouth shut 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.210
 yes I am one of the main 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.490
 detractors of javier hernández and I think 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.740
 that only for me I do not see fit in 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.630
 the real madrid thing is a player who 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.710
 you need minutes 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.290
 and in real madrid he is not going to 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.060
 find is the great depression not if 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.550
 you have players how good is benzema 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.500
 let's talk about someone could come raúl no 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.060
 me to tomás gómez the network 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.130
 that is with a castilla in the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.420
 second time I could upload it another 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.540
 opportunity ensures another player 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.720
 these images tells us a lot about javier 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 hernandez 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.790
 like a footballer who had already 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.280
 everything that has suffered a lot suffers a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.740
 tear out there a very common pull in 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.210
 an athlete and tears for the 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.820
 suffering that he has had for the 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.070
 tired and here navas hugs him is 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.510
 a player who wanted to battle from his 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.820
 arrival in 2010 to football 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.980
 international that is European football and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.710
 who is in the best team in the world in 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.170
 the field in europe a golden tear 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.540
 of course for the second best 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.760
 Mexican goal scorer only swallowed 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.100
 dreams are eight goals and they talked about 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.240
 he today uncovers a lot with this goal of 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.210
