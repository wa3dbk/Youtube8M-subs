 m 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.259
 this time on screens 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.259
 until now compensation for work off the table 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 that means I can pursue my hobby 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.340
 the inspirations edges or something to try out what you might later on 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 could bring into the skin but mainly it is currently about 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.560
 that the pictures deserve to get finished exhibition 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.990
 then I am also a bit on the rotate the schedule is one 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.790
 little 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.560
 Heritage want everything back there so I would have to be afterwards as well 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.470
 again 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.690
 the work 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.540
 he is 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.560
 Dr 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.340
 Dr 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.670
 I decided on this topic 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.570
 because I have many in the past too 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.090
 Jerg and smacks content Aware had to 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 but I would like to portray them now 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 That's why Hermann Harrer has 15 favorites 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.560
 compiled my favorites 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.590
 subtitles 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.560
 brought to canvas for this exhibition 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.320
 4 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 Dr 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.890
 in Japan 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.290
 so inspired 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.740
 that I thought about it 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 to donate part of the proceeds of the exhibition to Japan and also has 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.910
 to give something back 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.530
 through the journey he made there through the things we do there 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.170
 experienced and experienced 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.640
 it was important for me that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 Japan in the form again what can return 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.160
 I'm for critics, so I know this is in many pictures 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.400
 just important and even if there are clear criticisms 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.670
 and I hope that people will look at them percent 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.880
 9 percent saved Tal open for me here 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 I'm also not a percent of skilled artists studied artists 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.909
 so that knows everything as well as that must work so so 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.239
 but the pictures are actually from the first glance to the last picture 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 created by trying it out 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.779
