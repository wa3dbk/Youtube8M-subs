00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 and now I'm going to teach you a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.519
 node in 8 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.330
 good one that a blanket to record on top 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.639
 of my bed but finally teach you 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.929
 198 this year at 8 it's a very name 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.060
 simple to do 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.380
 he is very handsome too he stays with 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.310
 a format of 18 so the name appears 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.189
 18 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 it is mainly used to record 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.050
 wake up imagine you have a rope 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.579
 moving from one place to the other only 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 I have to get to a point where she 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.700
 You can not go there anymore , you use teaching. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 to catch her ok show you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 how do you do 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.520
 that name and then I 'll teach the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.860
 variations of it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 first you take two pieces to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.219
 rope or its tip is only the tip 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 true there you go and get the tip 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:07.470
 crossing the front 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:13.340
 takes a turn from behind and enters the handle and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.340
 Pull it will be fine like this 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 I will show once again the tip crosses 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.979
 forming a club loop crosses the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.829
 front is important this is not going to have to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 doing the opposite goes behind and enters 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:45.320
 on the frontin handle it stays that way now 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.090
 I'm going to teach you a variation 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.860
 of node 8 that would be 8 double-double it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 will be in the same format 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.540
 only in the end it will make a handle 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.560
 that helps you want to learn some 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.439
 hook object on these things you go 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.899
 do the same way only that actually 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.250
 that part you take points to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.950
 pass and cross 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.690
 It's going to be a tie. You fold. Wake up. 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 medium 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.930
 I love you, you fold them together. 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 ready 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:35.130
 crosses the handle crosses the front passes through 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:41.360
 back and enters the handle gave it is with the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.850
 same format and formed a handle at the end 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.230
 catch pass yet again though is the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.320
 same thing on the other, but the difference 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:56.130
 is that you have a rope from the other crosses 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:03:09.900
 from the front goes behind and enters the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:11.160
 handle and now the other variation is the name 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.210
 on 8 fold 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.450
 How do you get 18 folded? 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.620
 end of the rope here and the other 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.480
 passing rope is invested contrary 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.660
 I think you can come home here to here 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.770
 Then you 'll get one of those. 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.070
 tips 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:41.430
 I will choose the black and the first will 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:46.620
 make 98 inside the yellow rope will do 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.890
 the clinging tip crosses the front passes 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.750
 behind and enter the handle has no 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.209
 Yellow problem staying inside is not for 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.209
 stay in indoors 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:12.000
 and parents in the same thing with the tip 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:18.959
 yellow points crosses the front passes 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.790
 behind and came into the handle the purpose 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.490
 to teach very much when we 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.140
 fisherman you join these two tips and 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.490
 is it good or 8 and its variations become 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.490
 with us for the next to the coast
