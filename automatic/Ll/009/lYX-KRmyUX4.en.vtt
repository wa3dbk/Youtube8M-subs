00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
all you need to start with it can be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
all you need to start with it can be
much<00:00:29.580> shorter<00:00:29.609> than<00:00:29.970> mine<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.539> long<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
much shorter than mine as long as it's a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.350 
much shorter than mine as long as it's a
couple<00:00:31.380> inches<00:00:31.560> long<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.070> could<00:00:32.790> wrap<00:00:32.969> around

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
couple inches long and could wrap around

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.830 
couple inches long and could wrap around
a<00:00:33.630> headband<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.760> key<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.660> need

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
a headband this is the key that you need

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.780 
a headband this is the key that you need
something<00:00:37.140> soft<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.770> stretchy<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.550> could<00:00:38.670> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
something soft and stretchy it could be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
something soft and stretchy it could be
a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:38.969> bit<00:00:39.149> better<00:00:39.300> than<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.050> probably

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
a little bit better than this I probably

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
a little bit better than this I probably
wouldn't<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.129> thicker<00:00:41.430> than<00:00:41.670> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
wouldn't do it much thicker than this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.080 
wouldn't do it much thicker than this
but<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.110> need<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:44.250> own<00:00:44.370> straight

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

you just kind of proof to back up a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
you just kind of proof to back up a
little<00:01:18.900> bit<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> doesn't<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.680> totally<00:01:20.189> flat

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
little bit so it doesn't go totally flat

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.810 
little bit so it doesn't go totally flat
when<00:01:20.820> you're<00:01:21.000> sleeping<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.950> literally

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
when you're sleeping and then literally

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390 
when you're sleeping and then literally
all<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> start<00:01:24.869> doing<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.189> hair

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
all you start doing is one your hair

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
all you start doing is one your hair
around<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> headband<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:29.130> making<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.670> bit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
around the headband I like making a bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.200 
around the headband I like making a bit
bigger<00:01:30.030> curl<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.720> i<00:01:30.750> choose<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.619> thicker

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
bigger curl so i choose like thicker

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.899 
bigger curl so i choose like thicker
sections<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:35.159> certainly<00:01:35.520> do

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
sections to use you can certainly do

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.609 
sections to use you can certainly do
like<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> smaller<00:01:36.450> section<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> gives<00:01:37.409> more

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
like a smaller section and it gives more

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.200 
like a smaller section and it gives more
of<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> ringlet<00:01:38.400> effect<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> take

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
of like a ringlet effect when you take

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140 
of like a ringlet effect when you take
it<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.950> even<00:01:41.189> include<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.670> bangs<00:01:41.880> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it out so I even include my bangs in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
it out so I even include my bangs in
this<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.659> find<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.320> gives<00:01:43.530> them<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this because I find it just gives them a

of<00:03:43.850> keep<00:03:44.120> wrapping<00:03:44.630> around<00:03:47.230> until<00:03:48.230> you've<00:03:48.410> got

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
of keep wrapping around until you've got

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.360 
of keep wrapping around until you've got
no<00:03:49.220> no<00:03:49.910> end<00:03:50.150> sticking<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.160> wraps

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
no no end sticking up so that wraps

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.670 
no no end sticking up so that wraps
around<00:03:52.640> a<00:03:53.090> few<00:03:53.300> times

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.880 

until<00:03:57.219> you<00:03:57.340> can<00:03:57.519> just<00:03:57.760> tuck<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.890> then

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
until you can just tuck it in and then

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.610 
until you can just tuck it in and then
you<00:04:00.069> just<00:04:00.219> want<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.519> go<00:04:00.670> through<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.620> can

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
in it to get it a little bit tighter so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.449 
in it to get it a little bit tighter so
that's<00:04:07.780> what<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.989> do<00:04:08.109> along<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.650> sides<00:04:08.950> just

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
that's what I do along the sides just

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.149 
that's what I do along the sides just
kind<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.670> make<00:04:09.849> sure<00:04:09.879> everything<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:11.159> grouped

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
kind of make sure everything is grouped

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.569 
kind of make sure everything is grouped
in<00:04:12.430> there<00:04:13.260> now<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.530> like<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.859> kind<00:04:15.159> of<00:04:15.250> take<00:04:15.430> it

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
in there now I like to kind of take it

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.979 
in there now I like to kind of take it
off<00:04:15.730> my<00:04:15.939> head<00:04:16.120> because<00:04:16.359> as<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:16.810> see

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
off my head because as you can see

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.860 
off my head because as you can see
already<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.650> can<00:04:17.680> get<00:04:17.979> little<00:04:18.280> lines<00:04:18.870> and

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
already you can get little lines and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.909 
already you can get little lines and
when<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.049> sleep<00:04:20.259> a<00:04:20.380> night<00:04:20.500> all<00:04:20.590> night<00:04:20.680> you

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
when you sleep a night all night you

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.219 
when you sleep a night all night you
might<00:04:21.039> end<00:04:21.220> up<00:04:21.340> with<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.579> kink<00:04:21.910> so<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.900> kind<00:04:23.169> of

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
might end up with a kink so I kind of

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.230 
might end up with a kink so I kind of
pushed<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.620> back<00:04:23.800> off<00:04:24.039> my<00:04:24.220> hairline<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.880> wrap

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
pushed it back off my hairline and wrap

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.499 
pushed it back off my hairline and wrap
it<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.490> try<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.789> tighten<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.389> as

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
it and just kind of try to tighten it as

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.260 
it and just kind of try to tighten it as
I<00:04:28.660> go<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:30.160> comes<00:04:30.580> almost<00:04:30.910> straight

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
I go so that it comes almost straight

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.659 
I go so that it comes almost straight
across<00:04:31.509> or<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:31.930> little<00:04:32.110> bit<00:04:32.229> high<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:33.370> obviously

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
across or a little bit high so obviously

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.730 
across or a little bit high so obviously
any<00:04:33.940> hair<00:04:34.210> that's<00:04:34.389> not<00:04:34.660> wrapped<00:04:35.080> up<00:04:35.289> doesn't

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
any hair that's not wrapped up doesn't

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.510 
any hair that's not wrapped up doesn't
get<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.919> curl<00:04:36.250> so<00:04:37.000> your<00:04:37.389> top<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:38.800> be<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.190> little

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
get the curl so your top can be a little

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.240 
get the curl so your top can be a little
bit<00:04:39.729> flat<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> morning<00:04:40.710> but<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.770> usually

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
bit flat in the morning but I usually

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.249 
bit flat in the morning but I usually
just<00:04:42.280> ease<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.789> up<00:04:42.910> or<00:04:43.300> put<00:04:43.599> the<00:04:43.690> top<00:04:43.900> half<00:04:44.110> of

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
just ease it up or put the top half of

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.810 
just ease it up or put the top half of
my<00:04:44.320> hair<00:04:44.590> up<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.889> let<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.250> rest<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.669> wave

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
my hair up and let the rest of the wave

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.689 
my hair up and let the rest of the wave
sit<00:04:46.180> down<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:47.110> it's<00:04:47.590> really<00:04:48.009> cool<00:04:48.190> or<00:04:48.430> if<00:04:48.580> you

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
sit down it's it's really cool or if you

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.070 
sit down it's it's really cool or if you
brush<00:04:48.880> them<00:04:49.090> out<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.240> little<00:04:49.389> bit<00:04:49.599> you<00:04:49.780> just<00:04:49.960> get

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
brush them out a little bit you just get

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.480 
brush them out a little bit you just get
natural<00:04:50.470> waves<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:50.979> doesn't<00:04:51.250> matter<00:04:51.400> that

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
natural waves and it doesn't matter that

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.120 
natural waves and it doesn't matter that
the<00:04:51.759> tops<00:04:51.970> not<00:04:52.240> done<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.500> that's<00:04:53.710> what<00:04:54.009> it
