00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
especially coming from the guitar and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
especially coming from the guitar and
the<00:02:05.850> drums<00:02:06.180> some<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.600> great<00:02:06.840> percussion

all over this record I think the vocals
are<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.430> acquired<00:02:12.090> taste

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
are a little bit of an acquired taste

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.630
