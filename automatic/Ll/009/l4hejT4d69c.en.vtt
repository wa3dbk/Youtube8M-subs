trying<00:00:17.950> to<00:00:18.189> tie<00:00:18.369> and<00:00:19.270> you<00:00:19.390> may<00:00:19.570> think<00:00:19.869> that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
trying to tie and you may think that

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.780 
trying to tie and you may think that
Maryland<00:00:20.680> should<00:00:20.800> conserve<00:00:21.220> some<00:00:21.400> time<00:00:21.610> house

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
Maryland should conserve some time house

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.980 
Maryland should conserve some time house
because<00:00:22.119> they<00:00:22.240> may<00:00:22.360> have<00:00:22.480> enough<00:00:22.689> time<00:00:22.869> for

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
because they may have enough time for

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.510 
because they may have enough time for
offense<00:00:23.320> but<00:00:23.470> don't<00:00:23.650> be<00:00:23.770> going<00:00:23.950> into<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.310> wind

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
offense but don't be going into the wind

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.830 
offense but don't be going into the wind
so<00:00:24.700> if<00:00:25.539> such<00:00:25.750> nation<00:00:26.169> makes<00:00:26.380> it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.619 

so<00:00:30.530> I<00:00:30.590> would<00:00:30.740> be<00:00:30.830> surprised<00:00:31.160> if<00:00:31.370> they<00:00:31.490> use

for<00:01:01.530> excessive<00:01:02.400> separation

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.490 

whoosh

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 

and<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> something<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> defensive

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and this is something that the defensive

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.340 
and this is something that the defensive
cultures<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.870> been<00:01:18.990> working

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
cultures have been working

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.320

please

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350
