okay<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.450> again<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.350> programs<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
okay now again these are programs that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
okay now again these are programs that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
there now there there are several ways

there now there there are several ways

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
in which you can access remote app

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
in which you can access remote app
programs<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.000> said<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.659> click<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
programs as we said we can click a

Terminal Services web access and that is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
Terminal Services web access and that is
often<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:07.229> way<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.770> chosen<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
often the the way that it's chosen but

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.279 
often the the way that it's chosen but
there<00:02:08.459> are<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> couple<00:02:08.700> other<00:02:08.910> ways<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.420> well

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
there are a couple other ways as well

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.059 
there are a couple other ways as well
you<00:02:10.709> could<00:02:10.890> pre<00:02:11.099> create<00:02:11.520> an<00:02:11.790> RDP<00:02:12.239> or

you could pre create an RDP or

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.720 
you could pre create an RDP or
Desktop<00:02:13.489> Protocol<00:02:14.060> file<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.950> then

in<00:04:26.699> terms<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:27.419> time<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.590> cost<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:30.050> install

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
in terms of of time and cost to install

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.809 
in terms of of time and cost to install
the<00:04:31.319> line<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.650> business<00:04:31.740> applications<00:04:32.189> on

the line of business applications on
every<00:04:33.120> machine<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.050> instead<00:04:34.409> we<00:04:34.889> install<00:04:35.250> them

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
every machine so instead we install them

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.830 
every machine so instead we install them
on<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> terminal<00:04:35.819> server<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.449> we<00:04:36.509> make<00:04:36.689> them

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
on a terminal server and we make them

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.649 
on a terminal server and we make them
available<00:04:36.990> through<00:04:37.979> remote<00:04:38.909> app<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.539> that

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
available through remote app and that

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.540 
available through remote app and that
really<00:04:39.870> goes<00:04:40.139> with<00:04:40.349> any<00:04:40.650> application

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
really goes with any application

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.760 
really goes with any application
deployment<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:42.629> you<00:04:42.689> don't<00:04:43.020> have<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.379> deploy

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
deployment so you don't have to deploy

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.920 
deployment so you don't have to deploy
and<00:04:44.129> maintain<00:04:44.310> different<00:04:44.969> versions<00:04:45.659> of<00:04:45.810> the

and maintain different versions of the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.110 
and maintain different versions of the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.390 
same same program
you<00:04:48.810> know<00:04:48.930> if<00:04:49.259> employees<00:04:49.650> need<00:04:49.979> multiple

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
you know if employees need multiple

versions<00:04:50.789> of<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:50.939> program<00:04:51.180> then<00:04:51.569> I<00:04:51.659> can

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
versions of the program then I can

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.110 
versions of the program then I can
install<00:04:52.169> more<00:04:52.469> than<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:52.800> version<00:04:52.979> on<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
install more than one version on the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.959 
install more than one version on the

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
remote app you can install those

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.619 
remote app you can install those
programs<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.069> make<00:05:17.190> them<00:05:17.340> available<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.909> the

different deployment methods that we can

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.219 
different deployment methods that we can
see<00:05:29.759> here<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.210> again<00:05:30.629> we're<00:05:30.840> gonna<00:05:30.930> walk

configuring in either way we're gonna

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.659 
configuring in either way we're gonna
walk<00:05:38.940> through<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.509> configuration<00:05:40.129> next<00:05:41.129> with

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
walk through the configuration next with

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.019 
walk through the configuration next with
the<00:05:42.180> Terminal<00:05:42.659> Services<00:05:43.169> web<00:05:43.620> access<00:05:44.219> role
