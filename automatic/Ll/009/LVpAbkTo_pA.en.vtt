00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
your paintings in such a way that you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
your paintings in such a way that you
know<00:00:33.150> how<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.900> use<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.710> art<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.250> composition

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
know how to use the art of composition

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
know how to use the art of composition
and<00:00:36.210> when<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.280> know

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and when you know that then you know

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.100 
and when you know that then you know
you're<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.600> streets<00:00:40.020> ahead<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> them

before I go any further let's look at a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.860 
before I go any further let's look at a
bit<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.170> terminology<00:01:03.500> here<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.210> word<00:01:05.420> balance

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
bit of terminology here the word balance

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.750 
bit of terminology here the word balance
has<00:01:06.140> been<00:01:06.170> used<00:01:06.590> interchangeably<00:01:07.490> between

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
has been used interchangeably between

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.570 
has been used interchangeably between
symmetrical<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.960> equilibrium<00:01:09.860> compositions

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
symmetrical and equilibrium compositions

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
while both have to do with balance a

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.070 
while both have to do with balance a
clear<00:01:13.760> distinction<00:01:14.300> should<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.750> made<00:01:14.870> between

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
clear distinction should be made between

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.530 
clear distinction should be made between
the<00:01:15.650> two<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:16.100> enable<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.610> better<00:01:16.640> understanding

the two to enable a better understanding
of<00:01:17.660> these<00:01:17.810> two<00:01:17.990> concepts<00:01:19.090> if<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.240> painting<00:01:20.900> is

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
of these two concepts if a painting is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.050 
of these two concepts if a painting is
symmetrical<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.860> means<00:01:22.160> that<00:01:22.370> one<00:01:22.550> half<00:01:22.820> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
symmetrical it means that one half is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.090 
symmetrical it means that one half is
exactly<00:01:23.410> proportional<00:01:24.410> to<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> other<00:01:24.830> half

by implication that means that the one
half<00:01:27.920> weighs<00:01:28.960> exactly<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.200> same<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.650> the
