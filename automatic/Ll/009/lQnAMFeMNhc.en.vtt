00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.450
 disappearing the forest disappears all 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.450
 what is naturally there 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.500
 when people here were authorized 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.890
 to work they went to tables 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 taste 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.860
 productive activities the industry 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.170
 timber has a market for pine and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.360
 has a market for eucalyptus that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 has no equivalent development for the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 coihue for the raÃºl and for the language 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 then that has led to that has 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.540
 Emphasized the eucalyptus market and the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.790
 pine to the point that has replaced huge 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.949
 extensions of the native forest the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.780
 problem then is not being only 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.629
 from other countries to be introduced but 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 they replace is pure calypso and pure 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.620
 pine that is the problem the problem is not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.320
 is that Spanish or Spanish 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.630
 It's probably bad that it's pure 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.630
 Castilian in the negation of the other 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 today it is tremendously difficult to have 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.630
 to talk about our value element 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.980
 because a lot of it we have lost 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.920
 when I went to school I started to lose 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.150
 the same formerly when boy 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 I knew almost perfectly speak my 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.460
 language yo 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.140
 when I learned I was when 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.020
 I went into the school they talked about the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.380
 next to a teacher suddenly arrived 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.460
 He said not to speak that language anymore 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 because that is going to die 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.390
 and with a language we show you 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.000
 We bring to hand a world languages 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.840
 with what I want to say we involve a 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.010
 different type of relationship implies a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.750
 recognition of beings that are 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.229
 forgotten because they are not in the language 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.310
 everyday of the Chilean being that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.310
 Concentrate in Santiago 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.860
 before the people rooted plus the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 nature was because they educate it go very 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.600
 different from the education that is given 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.180
 children formerly children what 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.630
 they were on a hill they saw the sea 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.360
 mountain hill everything and there is point by point 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.640
 he explained to them that yes it was a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.330
 good education observing and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.330
 watching
