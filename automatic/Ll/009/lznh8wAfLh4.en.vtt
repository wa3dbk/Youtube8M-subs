00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.240
 but a little over a mile away 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.109
 small bay grooves do not know 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.070

 quite successfully pike well, something like this 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.440
 Well, I think fishing should not be 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.930
 bad at least 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
