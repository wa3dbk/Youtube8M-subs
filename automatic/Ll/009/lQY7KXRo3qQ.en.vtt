 palm interviewed separately to three people who were on the boat 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.070
 rus paok where they have seen three large plugs were seen and gave 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.700
 know their presence also seems to avoid referred with the instruments 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.339
 ship's 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:23.119
 the franklin delano roosevelt was the first aircraft carrier to carry 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.829
 nuclear weapons 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.980
 two local newspapers seemed to attract them anything nucleated in the 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:29.609
 Going 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.900
 the first time this happened it was 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.930
 p in the North Sea in England in the operations carried out 0 by the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.180
 NATO September 1952 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 NATO started the main country operation the first maneuvers or multilateral 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200
 From the earth 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.660
 the fpr was part of an exercise of the NATO fleet 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 called operation members on the coasts of denmark the rosedal the reason and the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.200
 British aircraft carriers witnessed one of the multiple sightings 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.190
 of the most incredible sickle in history 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.790
 in this fact the defense minister of the united kingdom called it a sighting of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.420
 UFO 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.440
 In the exercise, 200 ships a thousand aircraft and more than 80 thousand men participated. 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.450
 the NATO countries in the waters near Denmark 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.460
 and one of the largest and most advanced boats of the time the worm 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.030
 taught the way 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.190
 the ship was part of a group of forces that sealed the access of the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.780
 Soviet submarines across the North Sea to the Atlantic 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.830
 that was important because what happened if there was a base of two months of payment of the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 North Sea and this northern area of ​​Europe 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 we watched them and they watched us 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 on September 13, 1952 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.770
 the Danish destroyer empire moresco 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 I was in the Baltic Sea north of the island bogado 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.030
 the lieutenant commander former minister who pointed out that his crew 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.290
 supposedly they saw a triangular luminous object flying at high speed through 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.620
 above the sergio water of the main fleet the object sublimated to the west 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.889
 then he turned to southeast asia and russia 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.889
 bush 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.150
 in the following week there were more sightings from denmark to the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
 command bases of air operations in Scotland 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.970
 September 20, 1952 7 and 30 pm 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.619
 three Danish officers well a shining disc-shaped object get up 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.909
 of the water and pass over them 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.369
 if he was heading towards the NATO fleet 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.369
 and the frustrated 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.359
 the metallic UFO went east and the clouds disappear 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.649
 September 21, 1952 less than 24 hours later six British pilots 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.969
 they saw over the North Sea an object that rose from the water and 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.089
 stealthily approaching the fleet 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.109
 they supposedly followed him 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 but the subject veil was his first partner 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.629
 yordan the museum veteran says he talked to a witness that makes more 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.189
 40 years old 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.560
 they had a contact that are art three or four destroyers and could not 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.919
 see what that was because he moved with them 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.260
 that thing was 400 meters wide and it came out of the water and when it did it touched 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:35.069
 one of the old boats we read that was later reported as a collision 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.730
 between two destroyers but he says that that was not what happened because he was 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.729
 indicated that thing came out of the water and flew 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:48.069
 according to the reports these sightings had a similar trait and 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.319
 spooky 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.390
 all the witnesses made those objects or six boxes in whatever they were 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.390
 they watched closely the naval exercises 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:03.989
 after the operation you took me there were many sailors and aviators of the 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.839
 reason that objects were given 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:11.659
 it was not just one or two people they were members of the fdr crew 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.840
 so that was one of the famous multiple sightings where all 

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.949
 they saw those objects 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.440
 a journalist aboard the cruise in those operations did not have perhaps the best 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:27.039
 vision of that swarm of opposition activity towards your camera 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.159
 on September 20, 1952 the 11 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.319
 several miners saw others and spherical veil coming out of the water towards the sky 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.249
 behind the fleet 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.930
 the journalist aguadas litwin aboard the front bus we saw the operations 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.800
 pointing his 35-mm canon camera so the horizon 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:57.319
 cathodes images of a disc that seemed to defy the laws of the 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.949
 gravity 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.460
 it is believed that the images were studied by the Navy but never 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 registered an official report of the matter 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.599
 Huaraz Letwin took pictures of the flying discs on Russo in the 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.610
 operation impresses me 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.389
 I have copies of those photographs and it shows a conflict about the ship one 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.919
 see the structure of the ship and part of the wing of an airplane the photographs 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.750
 they show a bright light on the ship but some witnesses said that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.110
 it was a disk-shaped object 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.700
 UFO sightings in the sun forum 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.219
 in the operation my country 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.219
 they were not limited to troops and non-commissioned officers 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.699
 some believe that until the general eventualities in water 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.699
 could have witnessed similar objects aboard the cruise 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.559
 the fled one reports that says that there are senators was in the crossing of how much 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.039
 one of his sightings happened 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.529
 the people who witnessed those operations and events have had 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:04.129
 afraid to speak because they have threatened them and also fear that they ridicule 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.360
 according to experts, many documents relating to at least years are still 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.559
 classifieds 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.679
 but others have been released there is some reason to keep events secret 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.819
 50 years ago 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.330
 the military in fact the military of the most powerful nations in the world 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.349
 of in these things as threats they say they can penetrate our 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.589
 airspace elvira high security zones 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.960
 and exceeded in speed our fastest chefs means that we are 

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.289
 firm 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.990
 although many bus veterans in which researchers suspect that the 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.939
 bus advances in him made him a target of extraterrestrial attention 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:47.359
 some wonder if all of that reported activity is more of a 

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:49.729
 proof of sightings me 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:54.849
 I spoke to people over the years from my experience on the roster 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.960
 and I've seen first-hand evidence of what happened 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.060
 those of doubt that they know they have not had these experiences do not have a 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.120
 idea of ​​what this is and one expects that he believes that extraterrestrials do exist
