00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
here we are in November talking to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.680 
here we are in November talking to
Queenie<00:00:04.259> one<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.770> my<00:00:04.890> patients<00:00:05.450> Queenie<00:00:06.450> had

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
Queenie one of my patients Queenie had

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.660 
Queenie one of my patients Queenie had
previously<00:00:07.200> had<00:00:07.440> radial<00:00:07.859> keratotomy<00:00:08.040> so

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
previously had radial keratotomy so

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.560 
previously had radial keratotomy so
we're<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.940> ask<00:00:09.090> her<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.330> few<00:00:09.389> questions

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
we're going to ask her a few questions

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.200 
we're going to ask her a few questions
about<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.309> radial<00:00:11.309> keratotomy<00:00:11.429> Queenie<00:00:12.059> how

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
about the radial keratotomy Queenie how

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.910 
about the radial keratotomy Queenie how
long<00:00:12.389> ago<00:00:12.660> did<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.320> RK<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.740> you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
long ago did you have the RK do you

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.760 
long ago did you have the RK do you
remember<00:00:14.330> over<00:00:15.330> 20<00:00:15.599> years<00:00:15.750> ago<00:00:16.160> I<00:00:17.160> had<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:19.380> had

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
remember over 20 years ago I had a I had

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.060 
remember over 20 years ago I had a I had
it<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> both<00:00:20.400> eyes<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.510> my<00:00:22.470> vision<00:00:22.890> was

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it in both eyes it was my vision was

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
it in both eyes it was my vision was
minus<00:00:23.930> 6<00:00:24.930> 50<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.890> eye<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.279> minus<00:00:26.849> 7<00:00:27.210> 25<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
minus 6 50 and one eye and minus 7 25 in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
minus 6 50 and one eye and minus 7 25 in
the<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> could<00:00:29.220> barely<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> e

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the other so I could barely see the e

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.910 
the other so I could barely see the e
yeah<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:30.990> you're<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.230> nearsighted

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
yeah when you're that nearsighted

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.410 
yeah when you're that nearsighted
usually<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> hardly<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.820> there's<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> chart

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
usually can hardly see there's a chart

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.990 
usually can hardly see there's a chart
let<00:00:33.690> alone<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.110> yeah<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.100> most<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> my

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
let alone me yeah so most of my

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.819 
let alone me yeah so most of my
experience<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.750> RK<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> good

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
experience with RK was it was a good

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.740 
experience with RK was it was a good
operation<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.520> worked<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> while<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.629> then

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
operation it worked for a while but then

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420 
operation it worked for a while but then
most<00:00:39.989> people<00:00:40.410> eventually<00:00:40.710> start<00:00:41.190> getting

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
most people eventually start getting

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
most people eventually start getting
blurred<00:00:41.670> again<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.210> when<00:00:42.540> did<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.780> happen

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
blurred again so when did that happen

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
blurred again so when did that happen
for<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.469> Oh<00:00:44.750> probably<00:00:45.770> when<00:00:46.770> i<00:00:47.520> hit<00:00:47.820> my<00:00:48.090> maybe

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
for you Oh probably when i hit my maybe

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.799 
for you Oh probably when i hit my maybe
in<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.050> mid<00:00:49.079> 40<00:00:50.300> started<00:00:51.300> getting<00:00:51.510> harder<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
in my mid 40 started getting harder to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.639 
in my mid 40 started getting harder to
read<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> i<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.890> age<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:54.230> became<00:00:55.230> more

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
read and i guess with age I became more

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.010 
read and i guess with age I became more
farsighted<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> had<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> study<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
farsighted and so I had to study the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.459 
farsighted and so I had to study the
reading<00:00:58.440> glasses<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> became

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
reading glasses and so it became

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
reading glasses and so it became
somewhat<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> hassle<00:01:01.879> having<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> adjust

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
somewhat of a hassle having to adjust

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.310 
somewhat of a hassle having to adjust
from<00:01:04.350> computer<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> reading<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
from computer to reading and going to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.719 
from computer to reading and going to
distant<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.150> ended<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.689> wearing<00:01:10.729> glasses

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
distant so I ended up wearing glasses

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.780 
distant so I ended up wearing glasses
and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> tried<00:01:12.810> wearing<00:01:13.729> contact<00:01:14.729> lenses

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and I tried wearing contact lenses

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.039 
and I tried wearing contact lenses
basically<00:01:16.130> gas-permeable<00:01:17.130> ences<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
basically gas-permeable ences but that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
basically gas-permeable ences but that
became<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> problem<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.640> flattening

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
became a problem because the flattening

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
became a problem because the flattening
of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.890> created<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.100> problem<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
of the I created a problem with the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
of the I created a problem with the
curvature<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.600> gas-permeable<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
curvature of a gas-permeable and the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.210 
curvature of a gas-permeable and the
soft<00:01:26.159> lenses<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.869> my<00:01:28.140> stigmatism<00:01:28.710> did

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
soft lenses because of my stigmatism did

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.190 
soft lenses because of my stigmatism did
not<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.700> work<00:01:29.880> well<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:31.049> exactly

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
not really work well that's exactly

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
not really work well that's exactly
right<00:01:31.710> very<00:01:32.130> hard<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.549> fit<00:01:32.820> RK<00:01:33.299> patients<00:01:33.869> with

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
right very hard to fit RK patients with

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
right very hard to fit RK patients with
hard<00:01:34.290> lenses<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> cornea<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
hard lenses because the cornea is so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.910 
hard lenses because the cornea is so
flat<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.470> what<00:01:37.470> happened<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
flat and you what happened to you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
flat and you what happened to you
happens<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.520> lots<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.030> radial<00:01:39.329> keratotomy

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
happens to lots of radial keratotomy

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450 
happens to lots of radial keratotomy
patients<00:01:40.290> first<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:40.920> their<00:01:41.040> 40s

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
patients first they get into their 40s

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
patients first they get into their 40s
they<00:01:41.520> can't<00:01:41.729> read<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.720> start<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.020> more

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
they can't read they start getting more

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
they can't read they start getting more
farsighted<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.369> being<00:01:44.610> real

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
farsighted so you go from being real

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.460 
farsighted so you go from being real
nearsighted<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> while<00:01:46.229> you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
nearsighted then for a while you're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
nearsighted then for a while you're
perfect<00:01:46.890> i<00:01:46.950> start<00:01:47.189> getting<00:01:47.369> farsighted<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
perfect i start getting farsighted and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
perfect i start getting farsighted and
then<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.869> end<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> being<00:01:49.409> blurred<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.890> far

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
then you end up being blurred for far

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300 
then you end up being blurred for far
and<00:01:50.430> near<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.560> decided<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> do

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and near and then you decided to do

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.560 
and near and then you decided to do
something<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.759> tell<00:01:53.939> us<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.210> bit<00:01:54.329> about

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
something so tell us a little bit about

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.170 
something so tell us a little bit about
how<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.560> come<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> me<00:01:56.180> why

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
how you find out to come to me why

new radio station 93.9 and he was

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.559 
new radio station 93.9 and he was
talking<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
talking about this

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.220 
talking about this
a<00:02:09.549> surgeon<00:02:10.549> that<00:02:11.329> did<00:02:11.889> laser<00:02:12.889> surgery<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:14.230> he

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
a surgeon that did laser surgery and he

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.589 
a surgeon that did laser surgery and he
highly<00:02:15.739> recommended<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.180> did<00:02:17.450> some

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
highly recommended it and so I did some

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.140 
highly recommended it and so I did some
research<00:02:17.659> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.349> web<00:02:18.469> got<00:02:19.340> some<00:02:19.519> information

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
research on the web got some information

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.709 
research on the web got some information
that<00:02:20.180> i<00:02:20.629> emailed<00:02:21.700> dr.<00:02:22.700> Saul<00:02:22.909> thought<00:02:23.180> office

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
that i emailed dr. Saul thought office

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.729 
that i emailed dr. Saul thought office
to<00:02:24.549> asked<00:02:25.549> about<00:02:25.870> occupations<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.109> how<00:02:27.500> much

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
to asked about occupations and how much

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.970 
to asked about occupations and how much
experience<00:02:27.980> he<00:02:28.430> had<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.849> RK<00:02:29.150> patient<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:30.349> knew

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
experience he had with RK patient I knew

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.709 
experience he had with RK patient I knew
that<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:31.430> kind<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.849> unique<00:02:32.030> thing<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
that it was kind of a unique thing and

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.229 
that it was kind of a unique thing and
and<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.590> regular<00:02:34.010> laser<00:02:34.250> really<00:02:34.760> wasn't

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
and that regular laser really wasn't

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.659 
and that regular laser really wasn't
maybe<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.019> viable<00:02:36.590> thing<00:02:36.799> because<00:02:37.219> of<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> fact

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:37.669 
maybe a viable thing because of the fact

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.699 
maybe a viable thing because of the fact
that<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:38.450> already<00:02:38.810> had<00:02:39.019> incisions

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
that you know we already had incisions

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.030 
that you know we already had incisions
already<00:02:40.069> in<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.030> cornea<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.709> maybe

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
already in the cornea and that maybe

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.309 
already in the cornea and that maybe
this<00:02:43.519> wasn't<00:02:43.760> going<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.989> know<00:02:45.109> work

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
this wasn't going to be you know work

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.860 
this wasn't going to be you know work
well<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.069> anyway<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> did<00:02:46.699> give<00:02:46.909> dr.<00:02:47.299> salsa<00:02:47.629> call

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
well so anyway I did give dr. salsa call

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.110 
well so anyway I did give dr. salsa call
and<00:02:48.260> he<00:02:48.439> actually<00:02:48.620> emailed<00:02:49.250> me<00:02:49.400> personally<00:02:49.909> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
and he actually emailed me personally to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.179 
and he actually emailed me personally to
let<00:02:50.269> me<00:02:50.419> know<00:02:50.599> some<00:02:51.260> answer<00:02:51.859> some<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.069> my

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
let me know some answer some of my

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.509 
let me know some answer some of my
concerns<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:53.230> then<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.590> had<00:02:54.769> our<00:02:54.980> meeting<00:02:55.189> and

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
concerns and then we had our meeting and

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.789 
concerns and then we had our meeting and
he<00:02:56.299> suggested<00:02:56.629> PRK<00:02:57.530> versus<00:02:58.219> regular<00:02:58.939> laser<00:02:59.799> to

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
he suggested PRK versus regular laser to

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.920 
he suggested PRK versus regular laser to
standard<00:03:01.159> laser<00:03:01.310> surgery<00:03:01.790> which<00:03:02.750> would

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
standard laser surgery which would

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.229 
standard laser surgery which would
reshape<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.349> eye<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.980> not<00:03:04.189> and<00:03:04.459> somewhat

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
reshape my eye and not and somewhat

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.170 
reshape my eye and not and somewhat
preserved<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.620> RK<00:03:06.949> incisions<00:03:07.459> since<00:03:08.060> I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
preserved the the RK incisions since I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.459 
preserved the the RK incisions since I
was<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.329> little<00:03:08.419> bit<00:03:08.659> concerned<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.199> too<00:03:09.349> many

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:09.469 
was a little bit concerned of too many

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.360 
was a little bit concerned of too many
cuts<00:03:09.859> in<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.129> eye<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.900> Rick<00:03:12.560> Dees<00:03:12.769> was<00:03:13.069> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
cuts in the eye but Rick Dees was the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.789 
cuts in the eye but Rick Dees was the
starting<00:03:13.729> point<00:03:13.939> of<00:03:14.180> how<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:14.659> got<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.290> meet<00:03:15.470> dr.

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
starting point of how I got to meet dr.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.860 
starting point of how I got to meet dr.
Saul<00:03:15.979> yeah<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:16.970> you're<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.239> about<00:03:17.419> that<00:03:17.540> we

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
Saul yeah and you're right about that we

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.869 
Saul yeah and you're right about that we
used<00:03:18.049> to<00:03:18.169> do<00:03:18.290> LASIK<00:03:18.709> on<00:03:18.829> RK<00:03:19.189> patients<00:03:19.729> and

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
used to do LASIK on RK patients and

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.309 
used to do LASIK on RK patients and
found<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.509> a<00:03:20.599> little<00:03:20.629> riskier<00:03:21.229> because

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
found that it's a little riskier because

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.449 
found that it's a little riskier because
you're<00:03:21.560> cutting<00:03:21.739> through<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.189> radio

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
you're cutting through the radio

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.719 
you're cutting through the radio
keratotomy<00:03:22.879> incisions<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.590> PRK<00:03:25.189> is<00:03:25.430> being

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
keratotomy incisions and so PRK is being

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.819 
keratotomy incisions and so PRK is being
done<00:03:25.909> more<00:03:26.120> commonly<00:03:26.540> now<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:26.989> RK<00:03:27.349> patients

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
done more commonly now in RK patients

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.129 
done more commonly now in RK patients
and<00:03:27.949> it<00:03:28.040> works<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.340> as<00:03:28.669> well<00:03:28.729> as<00:03:29.030> lasik<00:03:29.479> but

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
and it works just as well as lasik but

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.839 
and it works just as well as lasik but
as<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.470> found<00:03:30.680> out<00:03:30.919> it's<00:03:31.250> not<00:03:31.430> quite<00:03:31.699> as

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
as you found out it's not quite as

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.089 
as you found out it's not quite as
accurate<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.689> when<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.439> treated<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:33.859> we

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
accurate and when we treated you we

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.469 
accurate and when we treated you we
tried<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.459> give<00:03:34.609> you<00:03:34.639> a<00:03:34.729> reading<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.389> a

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.479 
tried to give you a reading I in a

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.969 
tried to give you a reading I in a
distance<00:03:35.870> sign<00:03:36.049> it<00:03:36.259> turned<00:03:36.439> out<00:03:36.530> both<00:03:36.739> eyes

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:36.979 
distance sign it turned out both eyes

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.249 
distance sign it turned out both eyes
became<00:03:37.340> reading<00:03:37.729> eyes<00:03:37.879> and<00:03:38.329> I<00:03:38.870> was<00:03:39.019> pretty

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:39.259 
became reading eyes and I was pretty

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.140 
became reading eyes and I was pretty
sure<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.500> eventually<00:03:40.250> you'd<00:03:40.430> come<00:03:40.669> down<00:03:40.939> and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
sure that eventually you'd come down and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.149 
sure that eventually you'd come down and
be<00:03:41.239> good<00:03:41.599> but<00:03:41.840> we've<00:03:42.319> watched<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.739> for<00:03:42.949> 10

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
be good but we've watched it for 10

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.399 
be good but we've watched it for 10
months<00:03:43.340> or<00:03:43.609> whatever<00:03:43.729> one<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.930> didn't<00:03:45.229> bud

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
months or whatever one and it didn't bud

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.550 
months or whatever one and it didn't bud
so<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:45.889> recently<00:03:46.400> retreated<00:03:47.269> you're<00:03:48.079> one<00:03:48.470> of

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
so we recently retreated you're one of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.170 
so we recently retreated you're one of
your<00:03:48.680> eyes<00:03:48.829> so<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.129> could<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.489> far<00:03:49.790> away<00:03:50.000> and

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
your eyes so you could see far away and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
your eyes so you could see far away and
now<00:03:50.299> we<00:03:50.359> finally<00:03:50.780> have<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.229> the<00:03:51.349> way<00:03:51.469> we

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
now we finally have you the way we

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.530 
now we finally have you the way we
wanted<00:03:52.009> it<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:52.370> you've<00:03:52.489> got<00:03:52.519> one<00:03:52.939> eye<00:03:53.299> that
