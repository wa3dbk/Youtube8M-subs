00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
kishimoto or is this just unnecessary

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.469 
kishimoto or is this just unnecessary
just<00:01:28.140> prolonging<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.280> series<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.329> it

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
just prolonging the series so that it

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
just prolonging the series so that it
ends<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.079> later<00:01:31.770> day<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.049> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
ends on a later day so that the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.319 
ends on a later day so that the
companies<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.549> money<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
companies can get more money out of it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.719 
companies can get more money out of it
out<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> manga<00:01:38.479> now<00:01:39.590> well<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.430> both

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
out of the manga now well I can see both

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
out of the manga now well I can see both
parts<00:01:42.509> valid<00:01:43.579> because<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.210> side<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
parts valid because on one side the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.499 
parts valid because on one side the
company's<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
company's think of just think about the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.020 
company's think of just think about the
money<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.439> money<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.369> number<00:01:50.759> one

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
