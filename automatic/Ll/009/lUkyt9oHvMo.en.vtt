00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.349 
together is the breast cancer is so
curable<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.789> makes<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.179> happy

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.410 

I<00:00:59.050> thought<00:00:59.410> that<00:01:00.340> science<00:01:00.760> was<00:01:00.880> very<00:01:01.120> cool

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
I thought that science was very cool

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.630 
I thought that science was very cool
when<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> was<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:01.930> kid<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.680> know<00:01:03.040> for<00:01:03.460> when<00:01:03.610> I

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
when I was a kid and I know for when I

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.790 
when I was a kid and I know for when I
was<00:01:03.850> seven<00:01:04.239> what<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.480> wanted<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.080> most<00:01:05.320> was<00:01:05.770> a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
was seven what I wanted the most was a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.570 
was seven what I wanted the most was a
chemistry<00:01:06.550> set<00:01:06.820> which<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.210> got<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:09.070> I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
chemistry set which I got and that I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.640 
chemistry set which I got and that I
just<00:01:09.820> was<00:01:10.000> started<00:01:10.450> really<00:01:10.630> early<00:01:10.720> I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
just was started really early I

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.500 
just was started really early I
definitely<00:01:12.130> didn't<00:01:12.460> want<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.880> dolls<00:01:13.090> right

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
definitely didn't want the dolls right

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.590 
definitely didn't want the dolls right
then<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:13.990> know<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.670> had<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.450> idea

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
then you know and then I had the idea

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.570 
then you know and then I had the idea
and<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.470> was<00:01:17.590> right<00:01:17.740> around<00:01:17.860> when<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.130> was<00:01:18.310> 12

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
and it was right around when I was 12

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.990 
and it was right around when I was 12
actually<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.950> know<00:01:21.070> science<00:01:21.520> was<00:01:21.670> great

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
actually that you know science was great

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.780 
actually that you know science was great
but<00:01:22.390> being<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.200> lab<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:23.979> know<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.400> mixing<00:01:24.700> a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
but being in a lab you know and mixing a

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.330 
but being in a lab you know and mixing a
bunch<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:25.060> chemicals<00:01:25.540> together<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.830> know<00:01:26.979> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
bunch of chemicals together you know it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.330 
bunch of chemicals together you know it
wasn't<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:28.210> much<00:01:28.240> fun<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.020> around<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:30.010> time

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
wasn't so much fun and around that time

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.300 
wasn't so much fun and around that time
actually<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.570> little<00:01:32.140> before<00:01:32.470> when<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.650> was<00:01:32.680> 12<00:01:33.100> a

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
actually a little before when I was 12 a

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.910 
actually a little before when I was 12 a
movie<00:01:33.700> came<00:01:33.940> out<00:01:34.119> called<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.140> incredible

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
movie came out called the incredible

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.460 
movie came out called the incredible
journey<00:01:36.310> or<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.700> incredible<00:01:37.090> voyage<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.290> it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
journey or the incredible voyage and it

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.290 
journey or the incredible voyage and it
were<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.100> scientists<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.790> were<00:01:39.940> shrunk

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
were the the scientists that were shrunk

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.150 
were the the scientists that were shrunk
up<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.080> they<00:01:41.200> were<00:01:41.290> injected<00:01:41.830> into

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
up and then they were injected into

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.859 
up and then they were injected into
inside<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.729> box<00:01:42.910> inside<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> body<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:43.750> they

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
inside the box inside the body so they

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.510 
inside the box inside the body so they
could<00:01:44.050> go<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.380> fix<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.710> problem<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.250> really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
could go and fix a problem in a really

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.040 
could go and fix a problem in a really
important<00:01:45.970> person<00:01:46.300> yeah<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.720> they<00:01:46.810> went

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
important person yeah and they went

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.510 
important person yeah and they went
around<00:01:47.229> in<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> white<00:01:47.649> cells<00:01:47.950> tried<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.280> get

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
around in the white cells tried to get

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.280 
around in the white cells tried to get
them<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.210> they<00:01:49.630> went<00:01:49.840> through<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.080> blood

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
them and they went through the blood

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.780 
them and they went through the blood
vessels<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:50.830> they<00:01:50.950> were<00:01:51.009> processed<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
vessels and they were processed and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.010 
vessels and they were processed and
eventually<00:01:52.210> they<00:01:52.360> did<00:01:52.690> what<00:01:52.840> they<00:01:52.869> were

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
eventually they did what they were

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.090 
eventually they did what they were
supposed<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.320> do<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.530> were<00:01:53.649> fished<00:01:53.890> out<00:01:54.040> of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
supposed to do and were fished out of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.260 
supposed to do and were fished out of
the<00:01:54.220> eye<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.670> now<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:54.910> there<00:01:55.000> were<00:01:55.090> bad

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
the eye and now and there were bad

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.389 
the eye and now and there were bad
people<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.869> everything<00:01:56.350> but<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:57.070> tell<00:01:57.369> you

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
people and everything but I tell you

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.790 
people and everything but I tell you
decide<00:01:57.910> I<00:01:58.060> thought<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.540> was<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.050> cool<00:01:59.440> this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
decide I thought that was so cool this

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.650 
decide I thought that was so cool this
is<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.190> most<00:02:00.340> amazing<00:02:00.790> thing<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.479> the

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
is the most amazing thing to that the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.410 
is the most amazing thing to that the
body<00:02:01.869> would<00:02:02.080> work<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:02.530> way<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.580> when<00:02:04.390> I

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
body would work that way and so when I

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.320 
body would work that way and so when I
was<00:02:05.039> between<00:02:06.039> 10<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.399> 12<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.940> thought<00:02:07.179> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
was between 10 and 12 I thought the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.699 
was between 10 and 12 I thought the
thing<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.600> wanted<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.899> do<00:02:08.110> most<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> whole

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
thing I wanted to do most in the whole

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.260 
thing I wanted to do most in the whole
world<00:02:09.009> was<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.459> be<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.640> doctor<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.770> think

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
world was to be a doctor and and I think

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.720 
world was to be a doctor and and I think
that<00:02:13.270> what<00:02:14.170> i<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.560> love<00:02:14.740> then<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.250> still

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that what i really love then I still

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.059 
that what i really love then I still
love<00:02:15.940> today<00:02:16.300> really<00:02:16.930> didn't<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.290> science<00:02:17.740> um

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
love today really didn't like science um

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.850 
love today really didn't like science um
that<00:02:18.970> wasn't<00:02:19.330> something<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.080> really<00:02:20.350> love

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that wasn't something that I really love

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.360 
that wasn't something that I really love
to<00:02:21.069> do<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.700> i<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.270> love<00:02:22.450> books<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.620> we're

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
to do and i just love books and so we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
to do and i just love books and so we're
trying<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.640> remember<00:02:24.850> back<00:02:25.180> when<00:02:25.209> i<00:02:25.450> was<00:02:25.480> 12<00:02:25.959> i

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
trying to remember back when i was 12 i

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.830 
trying to remember back when i was 12 i
really<00:02:27.100> didn't<00:02:27.400> want<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.180> much<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:28.810> with

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
really didn't want that much to do with

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.160 
really didn't want that much to do with
science<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.470> i<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.830> one<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> my<00:02:30.190> first

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
science and i think one of my first

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.360 
science and i think one of my first
interactions<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.530> surgical<00:02:32.980> side<00:02:33.220> of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
interactions with the surgical side of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
interactions with the surgical side of
things<00:02:33.550> was<00:02:33.880> when<00:02:34.060> we<00:02:34.209> dissected<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.870> frog<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
things was when we dissected a frog and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.800 
things was when we dissected a frog and
then<00:02:35.620> later<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.790> year<00:02:37.090> i<00:02:37.120> remember<00:02:37.690> we

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
then later on that year i remember we

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.290 
then later on that year i remember we
also<00:02:37.930> did<00:02:38.230> an<00:02:38.349> eyeball<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.490> felt<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.090> I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
also did an eyeball and I I felt like I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.330 
also did an eyeball and I I felt like I
would<00:02:40.569> never<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.110> my<00:02:41.560> life<00:02:41.800> want<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.220> do

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
would never in my life want to do

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.100 
would never in my life want to do
anything<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.940> involves<00:02:43.360> touching<00:02:43.540> frogs

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
anything that involves touching frogs

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.610 
anything that involves touching frogs
and<00:02:44.349> eyeballs<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.920> now<00:02:45.069> I'm<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.280> surgeon

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.350 

come<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.040> realization<00:02:49.340> until<00:02:50.120> really

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
come to this realization until really

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.210 
come to this realization until really
late<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.930> college<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.799> it's<00:02:51.920> interesting

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
late in college and it's interesting

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.710 
late in college and it's interesting
we're<00:02:52.549> talking<00:02:52.879> about<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.239> because<00:02:53.450> we

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
we're talking about this because we

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.300 
we're talking about this because we
never<00:02:53.840> give<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> opportunity<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.159> that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
never give the opportunity to do that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.110 
never give the opportunity to do that
and<00:02:56.150> um<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.049> think<00:02:57.650> what<00:02:57.890> made<00:02:58.430> me<00:02:58.670> want<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and um I think what made me want to be a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
and um I think what made me want to be a
doctor<00:03:01.239> was<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.390> I'd<00:03:02.510> spent<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> lot<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.019> time

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
doctor was that I'd spent a lot of time

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.160 
doctor was that I'd spent a lot of time
I<00:03:03.319> studied<00:03:04.040> several<00:03:04.220> languages<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.360> I

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
I studied several languages and I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.069 
I studied several languages and I
learned<00:03:06.650> how<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.980> write<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.000> I<00:03:08.329> really<00:03:08.810> wanted

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
learned how to write and I really wanted

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.559 
learned how to write and I really wanted
to<00:03:09.250> read<00:03:10.250> Shakespeare<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:11.000> my<00:03:11.150> whole<00:03:11.329> life

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
to read Shakespeare for my whole life

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.660 
to read Shakespeare for my whole life
and<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.319> was<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.769> kind<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.069> work<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.459> I

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
and that was the kind of work that I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.119 
and that was the kind of work that I
wanted<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.420> after<00:03:15.349> a<00:03:15.379> while<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.590> really

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
wanted to do but after a while I really

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.860 
wanted to do but after a while I really
felt<00:03:16.370> like<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:16.730> was<00:03:16.849> very<00:03:17.120> far<00:03:17.390> removed<00:03:17.420> from

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
felt like it was very far removed from

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.920 
felt like it was very far removed from
ever<00:03:18.170> getting<00:03:19.060> near<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.090> position<00:03:20.780> where<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
ever getting near a position where I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930 
ever getting near a position where I
could<00:03:21.049> actually<00:03:21.349> help<00:03:21.829> anyone<00:03:22.280> or<00:03:22.459> impact

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
could actually help anyone or impact

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.020 
could actually help anyone or impact
their<00:03:23.180> lives<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.660> any<00:03:23.810> meaningful<00:03:24.019> way<00:03:24.349> so<00:03:25.030> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
their lives in any meaningful way so I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.670 
their lives in any meaningful way so I
really<00:03:26.480> came<00:03:26.660> through<00:03:26.959> medicine<00:03:27.349> through<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
really came through medicine through the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.559 
really came through medicine through the
back<00:03:27.829> door<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.640> was<00:03:28.760> very<00:03:28.970> late<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
back door and I was very late to the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.000 
back door and I was very late to the
party<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:31.280> first<00:03:31.549> time<00:03:31.819> I<00:03:31.849> actually<00:03:32.150> saw

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
party but the first time I actually saw

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.479 
party but the first time I actually saw
a<00:03:34.010> patient<00:03:34.459> being<00:03:34.879> saved<00:03:35.269> by<00:03:35.629> what<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.489> we

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
a patient being saved by what we do we
