it's<00:00:00.149> finally<00:00:00.510> time<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.870> build<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.199> Aussies

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
it's finally time to build the Aussies

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.059 
it's finally time to build the Aussies
down<00:00:01.890> under<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.780> $750<00:00:03.780> gaming<00:00:04.259> PC<00:00:04.589> for<00:00:04.740> April

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
down under a $750 gaming PC for April

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.700 
down under a $750 gaming PC for April
2015<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.660> thing<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:06.990> will<00:00:07.200> say<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.589> I

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
2015 the one thing I will say is that I

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.620 
2015 the one thing I will say is that I
got<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> lot<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> requests<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.670> 900<00:00:09.269> -<00:00:09.450> around

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
got a lot of requests for 900 - around

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
got a lot of requests for 900 - around
about<00:00:09.840> $1,000<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.830> gaming<00:00:11.130> PC<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.700> for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
about $1,000 for a gaming PC and for

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.370 
about $1,000 for a gaming PC and for
some<00:00:12.179> reason<00:00:12.450> when<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.599> looked<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
some reason when I looked at all the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.609 
some reason when I looked at all the
parts<00:00:14.389> everything<00:00:15.389> was<00:00:15.660> off<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.049> mean<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
parts everything was off I mean the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.470 
parts everything was off I mean the
difference<00:00:16.920> between<00:00:17.010> an<00:00:17.250> i3<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.699> an<00:00:17.850> i-5<00:00:18.210> was

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
difference between an i3 and an i-5 was

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
difference between an i3 and an i-5 was
an<00:00:18.600> extra<00:00:19.050> hundred<00:00:19.289> dollars<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> i3<00:00:20.550> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
an extra hundred dollars and the i3 is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
an extra hundred dollars and the i3 is
clocked<00:00:20.970> higher<00:00:21.240> than<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> i5<00:00:22.050> then<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
clocked higher than the i5 then the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
clocked higher than the i5 then the
graphics<00:00:23.039> card<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.430> between<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.910> r9<00:00:24.300> 280<00:00:24.720> in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
graphics card is between an r9 280 in

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.580 
graphics card is between an r9 280 in
the<00:00:24.930> GTX<00:00:25.320> 970<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.099> over<00:00:26.779> $200<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.349> had<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the GTX 970 is over $200 so we had to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.169 
the GTX 970 is over $200 so we had to
factor<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.369> those<00:00:29.550> things<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
factor in a lot of those things and so

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
factor in a lot of those things and so
I'm<00:00:30.750> gonna<00:00:30.900> say<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.470> either<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.189> or

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I'm gonna say you either go with this or

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
I'm gonna say you either go with this or
you<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.180> something<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.570> around<00:00:33.960> $1,200

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
you go with something like around $1,200

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
you go with something like around $1,200
but<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.280> being<00:00:35.430> said<00:00:35.550> let's<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.600> with

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
but that being said let's get on with

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.020 
but that being said let's get on with
this

but today's bill will be a great build

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
but today's bill will be a great build

since Easter and all has weakened

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.340 
since Easter and all has weakened
against<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.059> American<00:01:00.600> dollar<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
Australia and the US so let's get on

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.980 
Australia and the US so let's get on
with<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.149> CPU<00:01:09.479> we're<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.899> with

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
with it so for the CPU we're going with

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
with it so for the CPU we're going with
an<00:01:10.140> i3<00:01:10.880> 4160<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.180> thing<00:01:12.390> comes<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.810> at

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
an i3 4160 now this thing comes in at

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
an i3 4160 now this thing comes in at
150<00:01:13.890> Australian<00:01:14.820> dollars<00:01:15.149> and<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> price

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
150 Australian dollars and for the price

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.169 
150 Australian dollars and for the price
it's<00:01:16.350> actually<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.640> considering

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
it's actually pretty good considering

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.719 
it's actually pretty good considering
the<00:01:18.509> closest<00:01:19.050> eye<00:01:19.200> 5<00:01:19.800> which<00:01:20.160> is<00:01:20.190> clocked<00:01:20.610> at

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the closest eye 5 which is clocked at

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.919 
the closest eye 5 which is clocked at
3.2<00:01:21.330> gigs

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
3.2 gigs

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.919 
3.2 gigs
cost<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.860> 250<00:01:23.850> dollars<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.810> like

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
cost over 250 dollars I was like

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.630 
cost over 250 dollars I was like
scratching<00:01:25.440> my<00:01:25.560> head<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> thinking<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
scratching my head and thinking what is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.219 
scratching my head and thinking what is
going<00:01:26.940> on<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.179> Australia<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> moment<00:01:28.110> why

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
going on in Australia at the moment why

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
going on in Australia at the moment why
is<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.530> four<00:01:28.800> core<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.280> much<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.700> expensive

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
is the four core so much more expensive

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
is the four core so much more expensive
than<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.929> i3<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.590> guess<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> i3<00:01:32.580> has<00:01:32.610> been

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
than the i3 I guess the i3 has been

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
than the i3 I guess the i3 has been
underrated<00:01:33.569> it's<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.170> selling<00:01:34.500> enough<00:01:34.830> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
underrated it's not selling enough that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.950 
underrated it's not selling enough that
being<00:01:35.580> said<00:01:35.819> it's<00:01:36.090> actually<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.899> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
being said it's actually the one of the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.809 
being said it's actually the one of the
best<00:01:37.200> value<00:01:37.560> CPUs<00:01:38.069> in<00:01:38.250> Australia<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
best value CPUs in Australia at the

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.490 
best value CPUs in Australia at the
moment<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.360> we're<00:01:39.539> gonna<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.929> with<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.229> today

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
moment so we're gonna go with it today

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
moment so we're gonna go with it today
since<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.310> four<00:01:41.580> threads<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.210> it'll

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
since it's got four threads and it'll

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
845 from MSI I know this thing comes in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.300 
845 from MSI I know this thing comes in
at<00:01:54.180> 84<00:01:54.780> strain<00:01:55.170> dollars<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> good

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
at 84 strain dollars and it's a good

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
at 84 strain dollars and it's a good
motherboard<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.180> price<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> mean<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> B

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990

81 m and this one is a little bit better

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.300 
81 m and this one is a little bit better
for<00:02:03.539> overclocking<00:02:03.869> than<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> H<00:02:04.590> 81<00:02:05.100> and

for overclocking than the H 81 and
variants<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> has<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> better<00:02:06.689> vrm<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.469> board

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740

variants as it has a better vrm on board
I<00:02:07.920> personally<00:02:08.579> used<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.910> variant<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> b85

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
I personally used a variant of this b85

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
I personally used a variant of this b85
motherboard<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.489> does<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
motherboard and I can see it does a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.090 
motherboard and I can see it does a
fantastic<00:02:11.940> job<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.989> running<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.650> Haswell

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
fantastic job of running the Haswell

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
fantastic job of running the Haswell
four<00:02:14.400> cores<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:15.209> well<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:16.019> only<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.500> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
four cores really well not only that it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.920 
four cores really well not only that it
stays<00:02:16.950> cool<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.489> it'll<00:02:17.940> support<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.480> graphics

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
stays cool and it'll support a graphics

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
stays cool and it'll support a graphics
card<00:02:18.989> at<00:02:19.350> PCI<00:02:19.829> Express<00:02:20.220> three<00:02:20.700> speeds<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.239> well

so<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.630> don't<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.959> worry<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.739> so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so you don't have to worry about that so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.310 
so you don't have to worry about that so
great<00:02:23.640> board<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> money<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.079> for<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
great board for the money so for the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.099 
great board for the money so for the
case<00:02:25.470> we're<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.769> with<00:02:25.859> a<00:02:25.920> $45<00:02:27.109> Coolermaster

case we're going with a $45 Coolermaster
3:3<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.700> case<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.660> decent

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
3:3 for you this case is just a decent

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
3:3 for you this case is just a decent
case<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.620> an<00:02:31.739> entry-level<00:02:32.100> case<00:02:32.579> but<00:02:32.850> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
case it's an entry-level case but it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.539 
case it's an entry-level case but it
will<00:02:33.090> fit<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:33.799> all<00:02:34.799> your<00:02:35.010> components<00:02:35.280> in

there no problems at all installation
should<00:02:37.709> be<00:02:37.769> pretty<00:02:38.220> good<00:02:38.459> since<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
should be pretty good since it is a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
should be pretty good since it is a
Coolermaster<00:02:39.750> case<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.950> things

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
Coolermaster case they do get things

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.099 
Coolermaster case they do get things
right<00:02:41.549> when<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.880> comes<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.269> simplicity<00:02:42.959> and

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
right when it comes to simplicity and

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.840 
right when it comes to simplicity and
that's<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.859> you're<00:02:44.040> gonna<00:02:44.160> need<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.670> today's

of<00:02:53.700> memory<00:02:54.090> it's<00:02:54.330> also<00:02:54.659> 84<00:02:55.379> dollars<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.950> it's

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
of memory it's also 84 dollars so it's

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.869 
of memory it's also 84 dollars so it's
not<00:02:56.250> too<00:02:56.580> bad

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
not too bad now you've also got one

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.430 
not too bad now you've also got one
stick<00:03:03.390> there<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.989> wish<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.170> add

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
stick there so if you wish to add

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.229 
stick there so if you wish to add
another<00:03:04.680> stick<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> future<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.640> get<00:03:05.760> 16

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
another stick in the future to get 16

another stick in the future to get 16
gigabytes<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.690> memory<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:07.349> can<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:07.739> that

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
gigabytes of memory you can do that

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.979 
gigabytes of memory you can do that
especially<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.700> you're<00:03:08.819> going<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.120> upgrade<00:03:09.510> to

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
especially if you're going to upgrade to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.199 
especially if you're going to upgrade to
a<00:03:10.020> fork<00:03:10.380> or<00:03:10.620> eight<00:03:10.830> threaded<00:03:11.250> CPU<00:03:11.849> in<00:03:12.060> the

a fork or eight threaded CPU in the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.760 
a fork or eight threaded CPU in the
future<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.959> just<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.349> switch<00:03:13.560> out

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
future so you just have to switch out

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.410 
future so you just have to switch out
the<00:03:13.890> CPU<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.430> well<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:14.940> use<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.209> same

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the CPU as well you can use the same

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.550

an online 290 which is going for around

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.530 
an online 290 which is going for around
$400<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.040> there's<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.310> GTX<00:04:02.700> 970<00:04:03.150> which<00:04:03.420> is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
$400 and then there's a GTX 970 which is

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.789 
$400 and then there's a GTX 970 which is
going<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:03.900> around<00:04:04.049> four<00:04:04.230> hundred<00:04:04.260> seventy

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
supply will be perfectly fine for that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.960 
supply will be perfectly fine for that
as<00:04:53.460> well

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
as well

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.640
