and<00:05:13.600> from<00:05:14.290> here<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.530> we're<00:05:14.890> just<00:05:14.920> going<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
and from here on we're just going to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.060 
and from here on we're just going to
repeat<00:05:15.670> rows<00:05:16.210> 2<00:05:16.570> &amp;<00:05:16.810> 3<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:20.230> remembering<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.890> knit

repeat rows 2 &amp; 3 so remembering to knit

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.720 
repeat rows 2 &amp; 3 so remembering to knit
the<00:05:21.220> first<00:05:21.400> stitch<00:05:21.550> because<00:05:22.240> it's<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.540> edge<00:05:22.660> 1

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
the first stitch because it's the edge 1

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:30.120 
the first stitch because it's the edge 1
bring<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:24.880> yarn<00:05:25.060> forward<00:05:25.480> purl<00:05:27.030> knit<00:05:29.130> 2

bring the yarn forward purl knit 2

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.530 
bring the yarn forward purl knit 2
together<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:31.950> so<00:05:32.950> on<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.820> as<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.090> carry<00:05:34.330> on

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
together and so on and as you carry on

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.540 
together and so on and as you carry on
you'll<00:05:35.110> see<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.590> pattern<00:05:36.040> starts<00:05:36.490> to

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
you'll see that a pattern starts to

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.140 
you'll see that a pattern starts to
emerge<00:05:40.770> as<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.010> can<00:05:42.160> see<00:05:42.370> I've<00:05:42.850> now<00:05:43.090> done

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
emerge as you can see I've now done

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.950 
emerge as you can see I've now done
quite<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.780> few<00:05:43.930> rows<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:45.610> hopefully<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.780> can

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
quite a few rows and hopefully you can

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.470 
quite a few rows and hopefully you can
see<00:05:47.170> that<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.590> rib<00:05:47.770> pattern<00:05:48.520> is<00:05:49.000> starting<00:05:49.240> to

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
see that the rib pattern is starting to

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.240 
see that the rib pattern is starting to
emerge<00:05:49.660> just<00:05:51.810> keep<00:05:52.810> going<00:05:53.200> until<00:05:53.740> you've<00:05:54.040> got

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
emerge just keep going until you've got

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.070 
emerge just keep going until you've got
to<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> length<00:05:54.880> of<00:05:55.060> scarf<00:05:55.360> that<00:05:55.540> you<00:05:55.600> require

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
to the length of scarf that you require

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:06.279 
to the length of scarf that you require
then<00:05:56.770> cast<00:05:57.040> off<00:05:57.250> as<00:05:57.460> normal

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.349
