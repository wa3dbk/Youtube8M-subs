down<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> get<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:08.420> case<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.140> comes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
down and you get your case here it comes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
down and you get your case here it comes
this<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> USB<00:01:11.760> cord<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.670> does<00:01:14.820> look

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
this up the USB cord and it does look

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
this up the USB cord and it does look
like<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.570> gold<00:01:15.810> tip<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> think<00:01:16.530> believe

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
like it's gold tip so I think believe

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
like it's gold tip so I think believe
that's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.670> point<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> connectivity<00:01:18.420> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that's the two point of connectivity so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.429 
that's the two point of connectivity so
just<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.650> unwind<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.080> see<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.170> long

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
just go and unwind for you see how long

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.429 
just go and unwind for you see how long
it<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.180> was<00:01:24.180> made<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.540> notebook<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it is it was made for notebook so it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.999 
it is it was made for notebook so it
yeah<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> pretty<00:01:26.820> sure<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:28.009> three

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
yeah it is pretty sure it's about three

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.530 
yeah it is pretty sure it's about three
feet<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:31.070> either<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> fire<00:01:33.030> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
feet so either use this fire for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
feet so either use this fire for
connectivity<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.140> Bluetooth<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> doesn't

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
connectivity or Bluetooth it doesn't

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880 
connectivity or Bluetooth it doesn't
come<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:36.960> further<00:01:37.350> wireless
