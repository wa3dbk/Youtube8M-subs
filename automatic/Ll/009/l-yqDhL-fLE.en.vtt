00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.019
 in this group we will include three 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 antidepressants venlafaxine duloxetine and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.629
 bupropion all of them are effective in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 treatment of major depression 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.670
 venlafaxine venlafaxine and its 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 main metabolite or des tilden me 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.540
 faxin are potent inhibitors of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 reuptake of serotonin and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.090
 noradrenaline also inhibit 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 weakly dopamine reuptake 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.460
 this inhibition is dose-dependent to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.780
 low dose action predominates 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.550
 serotonergic if we increase the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.129
 dose is inhibited the reuptake of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.039
 noradrenaline at high doses is added 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.929
 the dopaminergic action clinically 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.149
 characterized by having a high profile 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.999
 of effectiveness even in depressions 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 resistant when administered at doses 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.530
 elevated it seems that the beginning of the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.530
 action occurs more quickly than 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.569
 with other antidepressants presents low or 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.899
 No affinity for the receivers 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:06.000
 cholinergic or histamine gicos is for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.579
 the less likely it is to cause 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.050
 sedative anticholinergic effects or 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.690
 cardiovascular like 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.900
 cyclical your security profile is 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.760
 similar to the effects ff 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 most frequent adverse reactions are presented to 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.220
 gastrointestinal level presentation 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.590
 rita offers many advantages over 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
 immediate deliberation that is the most 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 duloxetine is used 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.360
 antidepressant dual action inhibitor 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 of serotonin reuptake and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 noradrenaline without action 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.260
 receivers unlike the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.900
 venlafaxine its action is stable dose 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.300
 inhibits the reuptake of both amines to 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.530
 all doses administered have 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.800
 action on the three groups 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 symptomatic symptoms of depression 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.660
 anxious and somatic affective symptoms 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.630
 It is also effective in the treatment of 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.140
 neuropathic pain of fibromyalgia and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 of female urinary incontinence 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.750
 bupropion 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.060
 inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.830
 dopamine but has no effect on 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.380
 serotonin reuptake 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.540
 the hydroxide itself and its metabolite 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.090
 active also inhibits the reuptake of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.830
 noradrenaline weakly but what 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.280
 enough to produce effects 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.430
 antidepressants is also used in the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.990
 treatment of nicotinic dependence 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 the drugs with double mechanism of 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.820
 action together with the escitalopram are the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.220
 most used antidepressants in this 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.790
 moment for its effectiveness and its profile 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.790
 side effects
