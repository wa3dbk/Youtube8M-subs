00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello everyone, Igor, the idea of morphs 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.189
 today I would like to tell Yarovskaya 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.920
 exactly about the pcsx2 emulator settings 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.500
 many are interested many are asking 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 What are your settings for a comfortable game? 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 final fantasy 12 basically now i 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.330
 I will show the settings and with these settings 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 principle, everything works well for me 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.260
 it will be bad except 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.210
 if you do not have a gamepad then it will be 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 Of course it is inconvenient to play well, and so in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 principle emulator pulls let's break 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.739
 emulation settings so I'm there somewhere 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.739
 quickly scrolled so go here bye 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.890
 scx run version 1 and 2 0 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:55.289
 go to the emulation site 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:58.550
 here we have settings 2 and and and opi here 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:07.799
 that way me tuned and 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:14.400
 stand on a construction site here two times then we go 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 then here are the settings I have here with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 video window if you want to shoot a game 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.970
 or record your flyplay 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 it is necessary and then put permission 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 1280 to 720 and aspect ratio 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.659
 adjust to the size of the screen window and more 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 note when you install 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 emulator then remove the Russian language here 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.399
 such settings sleeps hacks included 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:54.060
 but at zero one at zero another at 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.399
 unit here is the advice to abuse because 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.490
 what performance falls 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.219
 but a fix for the games here and some 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.860
 cases helps but i don't put anything 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:12.850
 go further memory card settings 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.090
 so here are stored 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.050
 document while sex us cards here 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:25.240
 memory cards are stored i.e. your 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:32.560
 saving plugins a europe 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:39.130
 version 0 and 2 2 14 on 6 2000 4 console 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:43.450
 here that is bios you need anyway here 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.950
 that is, you hit the default folder here 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 me screenshots 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 quick save if you scrap on 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.320
 You can save by game 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:04.620
 use fast saves 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:04.620
 here is gs these are my settings here 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:17.470
 Ie for gamepad please spo2 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.790
 if you want to record a flyout then 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.950
 you need how it would be good for you 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.890
 heard again depends on 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.690
 microphone if you have a quiet microphone then 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.000
 need to do even less if you have 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 normal audibility 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.650
 put 30 percent of the sound and heard 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.090
 you and the game if it is one hundred percent 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.450
 you will not stand at all 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.510
 heard 50 the fight but the same thing 50 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.910
 Percentage too hard to hear 30 percent 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.910
 the most optimal 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:56.920
 here we are doing nothing here too 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.050
 here too, too well, that's such here 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.970
 settings 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.490
 even showed on principle everything here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.410
 showed 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:10.920
 here you see me yes but in principle 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.920
 everything 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.980
 program 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.560
