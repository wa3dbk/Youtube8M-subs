 many expected to appear and si double ar 

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.329
 in battlefield 4 as it is 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.579
 was battlefield 3 but on the facts we 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.829
 got a completely different barrel which 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.469
 faster shoots has a higher 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.779
 damage faster recharge and more capacious 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.819
 shop about the differences let's talk a little 

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:26.950
 later and now it's time for everyone 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.319
 favorite digits maximum damage after 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.299
 of the last patch, he dropped from twenty 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.630
 five to twenty four units 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.139
 minimum damage remains the same 15.4 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.289
 rate of fire 880 shots per minute 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:43.659
 recharge in the best traditions of m16 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.329
 full recharge takes 2 integers and 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.979
 thirty seven hundredths of a second tactical 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.439
 in 1.83 seconds the return is small 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.569
 has some care left and ciare in 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.340
 battlefield3 was awesome carbine 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.319
 which was designed for long range fights 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.869
 distances while having 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.209
 rate of fire 850 shots per minute 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.139
 and the lowest maximum damage in 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.980
 classroom carbine 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.950
 but it was not faith 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.290
 1 precise rifle with very high 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 minimal damage if I honestly wanted 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.740
 the return of such 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.260
 and sulfur but days changed version 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.660
 represented in the game in battlefield 3 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.480
 and ttsar used 6 millimeter patrol 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.570
 grindal and at battlefield 4 is presented 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.530
 modification under the classic 556 and this 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.980
 means we have standard damage 24 and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.960
 15.4 higher return and very bad 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
 results at a distance but it is not 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.430
 Scary except chuck changed itself 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.950
 concept from now it's stick bend over to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.770
 for short distances which, though 1 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.930
 year but can very accurately bang on 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.360
 average long range of some 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.670
 serious disadvantages from his father only hurt 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 plus adequate damage high dpm 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.840
 especially before the addition in addition to tea 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.030
 risen where was the main 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.250
 competitor in the face of mtor and also have 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.480
 incredibly fast reloading and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.420
 adequate cottage 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.210
 although in be father destroyed absolutely 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.550
 all except ak-12 but there he has 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.370
 there was a lower recoil making it 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.110
 super variative he calmly fired 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.870
 at medium and long distances to 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.940
 Sorry his ponerfili and we got 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.920
 as already said stick on and beam 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.370
 only for short and start modules 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 the group 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.880
 there is exactly that tactic of this rank on 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.170
 fast moving behind enemy lines 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.180
 destroying the whole squad by 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.820
 one shop sight you can 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.709
 install any small multiple capsules for 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.020
 reduce scatter when shooting from 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.180
 thighs at 25 percent on the trunk 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.760
 set the muzzle brake if you donâ€™t 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.130
 like a vertical cottage or muffler 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.489
 which will remove you radar and reduce 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.500
 bullet speed of up to 330 meters 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.260
 second also you can leave this 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.320
 the slot is empty because a king himself 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
 we already have a good handle 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.410
 ergonomic to reduce scatter 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.050
 when shooting in motion by 50 percent 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.720
 You can also put a corner handle 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.970
 because a king is what hurts when 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.100
 first shot a corner handle 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.290
 reduces initial return by 33 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.810
 percent overall we got very 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.910
 adequate barrel for short distances 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.739
 which which can be effective 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.459
 at medium and long distances if u 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.710
 you are very straight arms 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.660
 know how to control his return but 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.120
 I think that's all thanks for watching 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.449
 subscribe comment and wait 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.449
 Hyde tomorrow at 44 magnum caliber yet
