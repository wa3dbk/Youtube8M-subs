00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
tone certain color tone just so we're

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.789 
tone certain color tone just so we're
familiar<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:15.049> know<00:02:15.200> we're<00:02:15.319> drinking<00:02:15.620> bourbon

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.899 
pretty long oily in the mouth so it sits
there<00:04:35.539> viscous<00:04:36.139> it's<00:04:36.349> got<00:04:36.530> some<00:04:36.740> some<00:04:37.370> heft<00:04:37.699> to

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
there viscous it's got some some heft to

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.560 
there viscous it's got some some heft to
it<00:04:38.030> some<00:04:38.300> beef<00:04:38.449> to<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.949> there's<00:04:39.949> also<00:04:40.070> a<00:04:40.280> bit

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
it some beef to it there's also a bit

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.529 
it some beef to it there's also a bit
that<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:42.400> then<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.430> get<00:04:43.699> now<00:04:44.320> sort<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.380> like<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
that I then I get now sort of like a

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.080 
that I then I get now sort of like a
grip<00:04:47.539> sort<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.020> like<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.139> tannic<00:04:48.680> II<00:04:49.030> resin<00:04:50.030> a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
grip sort of like a tannic II resin a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.850 
grip sort of like a tannic II resin a
grip<00:04:50.449> there<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.080> again<00:04:51.320> comes<00:04:51.710> from

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
grip there and that again comes from

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.950 
grip there and that again comes from
that<00:04:51.979> barrel<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.580> think<00:04:53.389> some<00:04:53.570> of<00:04:53.599> that<00:04:53.750> in

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
that barrel I think some of that in

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.260 
that barrel I think some of that in
check<00:04:54.199> which<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.580> good<00:04:55.849> thing

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
check which it is is a good thing

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.089 
check which it is is a good thing
it<00:04:56.750> gives<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.080> bourbon<00:04:57.409> a<00:04:57.680> bit<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.889> balance

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
it gives the bourbon a bit of balance

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:10.050 
it gives the bourbon a bit of balance
there

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.680 

yeah<00:05:10.660> it's<00:05:10.810> excellent<00:05:11.880> litora<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:13.330> mean

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
yeah it's excellent litora I mean

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.090 
yeah it's excellent litora I mean
there's<00:05:13.840> some<00:05:13.990> roughness<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.650> there<00:05:14.950> in

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
there's some roughness to it there in

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.600 
there's some roughness to it there in
the<00:05:15.190> form<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:16.270> tannin<00:05:17.170> in<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.980> light<00:05:18.400> red

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
the form of that tannin in the light red

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.210 
the form of that tannin in the light red
wine<00:05:18.820> drink<00:05:19.390> red<00:05:19.570> wine<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.860> get<00:05:21.010> that

wine drink red wine you get that

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.830 
wine drink red wine you get that

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
getting out of this and red wines ages

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.040 
getting out of this and red wines ages
in<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:28.420> barrel

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
in a barrel

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.790 
in a barrel
so<00:05:29.440> it's<00:05:29.590> bourbon<00:05:29.980> so<00:05:30.520> it's<00:05:30.730> there<00:05:31.590> this<00:05:32.590> may

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800

maybe<00:05:40.330> even<00:05:40.570> an<00:05:40.660> eight<00:05:40.810> year<00:05:41.020> old<00:05:41.050> product<00:05:41.620> I

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
maybe even an eight year old product I

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.870 
maybe even an eight year old product I
have<00:05:41.830> a<00:05:41.860> little<00:05:42.010> bit<00:05:42.160> less<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.640> which

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
have a little bit less of that which

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.820 
have a little bit less of that which
would<00:05:43.090> make<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:43.480> a<00:05:43.570> little<00:05:43.690> rounder<00:05:44.200> but<00:05:44.770> I

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
would make it a little rounder but I

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.820 
would make it a little rounder but I
like<00:05:45.040> it<00:05:45.220> it's<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:46.270> it's<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:47.560> know<00:05:47.650> it's

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
like it it's it's it's you know it's

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.360 
like it it's it's it's you know it's
done<00:05:48.160> well<00:05:48.480> and<00:05:49.480> I'll<00:05:50.320> give<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.830> nice<00:05:51.070> solid

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
done well and I'll give it a nice solid

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.760 
done well and I'll give it a nice solid

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
eight point for this bourbon is is very

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.880

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
solid very good I would highly recommend

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.310 
solid very good I would highly recommend
picking<00:05:59.890> it<00:06:00.220> up<00:06:00.280> I<00:06:00.550> think<00:06:00.790> again<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.600> rough<00:06:02.110> you

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
picking it up I think again a rough you

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.750 
picking it up I think again a rough you
know<00:06:02.440> tidying<00:06:02.890> up<00:06:02.950> some<00:06:03.160> of<00:06:03.220> those<00:06:03.280> rough

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
know tidying up some of those rough

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.160 
know tidying up some of those rough
edges<00:06:03.970> would<00:06:04.600> making<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.020> even<00:06:05.170> even<00:06:05.620> more

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
edges would making it even even more

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.630 
edges would making it even even more
premium<00:06:08.170> product<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.680> give<00:06:09.040> that<00:06:09.190> score<00:06:09.520> up

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
premium product and give that score up

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.280 
premium product and give that score up
there<00:06:09.850> a<00:06:09.880> little<00:06:10.030> bit<00:06:10.180> but<00:06:10.900> we'll<00:06:11.020> just<00:06:11.170> have

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
there a little bit but we'll just have

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.840 
there a little bit but we'll just have
to<00:06:11.320> try<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.620> seventeen<00:06:12.220> and<00:06:12.370> review<00:06:12.670> it<00:06:12.760> on

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
to try the seventeen and review it on

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.330 
to try the seventeen and review it on
