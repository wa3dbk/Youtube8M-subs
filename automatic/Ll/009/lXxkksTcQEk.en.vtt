00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
plants okay like that size right there I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
plants okay like that size right there I
usually<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.409> three<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> four<00:01:56.070> seedlings<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
usually do three to four seedlings this

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.480 
usually do three to four seedlings this
size<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.899> probably<00:01:58.200> has<00:01:58.469> six<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.130> seven

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490

seedlings<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> maybe<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> soda<00:02:01.500> bottle<00:02:01.710> there

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
seedlings and maybe a soda bottle there

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
seedlings and maybe a soda bottle there
might<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.189> two<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.420> imagine<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.229> not

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
might have two so imagine I have not

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.899 
might have two so imagine I have not
counted<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> number<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.250> Sealand<00:02:05.670> see

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
counted the number of Sealand see
seedlings<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> neurotic

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
seedlings and I'm not that neurotic

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.999 
seedlings and I'm not that neurotic
not<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.729> crazy<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> did<00:02:10.619> count<00:02:10.890> my

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
not that crazy but I did count my

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.430 
not that crazy but I did count my
containers<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.760> 150<00:02:12.300> -<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.660> these

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
containers and that's 150 - so these

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.560 
containers and that's 150 - so these
right<00:02:13.590> here<00:02:13.800> my<00:02:14.010> lettuces<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.030> did<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.390> do

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
right here my lettuces and I did not do

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.760 
right here my lettuces and I did not do
lettuce<00:02:15.870> last<00:02:16.110> year<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.320> thought<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.650> could

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
lettuce last year I thought you could

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.230

only<00:02:16.890> direct<00:02:17.250> sew<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> lot<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.000> people

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
only direct sew it but a lot of people

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.630 
only direct sew it but a lot of people
say<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.540> use<00:02:18.750> winter<00:02:19.410> sewing<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.040> so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
say they use winter sewing for that so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.300
