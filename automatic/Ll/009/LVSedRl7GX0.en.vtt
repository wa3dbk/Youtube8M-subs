00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and yeah I can't believe I'm saying this

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.990 
and yeah I can't believe I'm saying this
but<00:01:44.930> try<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.260> ACR<00:01:45.800> with<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.070> ACOG<00:01:46.430> on<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.760> it's

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
but try the ACR with the ACOG on it it's

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.610 
but try the ACR with the ACOG on it it's
really<00:01:47.840> pretty<00:01:48.050> sweet<00:01:48.440> um<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:50.140> have<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> tendency

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
really pretty sweet um I have a tendency

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.930 
really pretty sweet um I have a tendency
to<00:01:51.650> think<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.010> they<00:01:52.160> card<00:01:52.460> bounces<00:01:52.820> around

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
to think that they card bounces around

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.640 
to think that they card bounces around
too<00:01:53.330> much<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.840> that's<00:01:54.170> why<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.320> don't<00:01:54.410> like<00:01:54.620> it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
too much and that's why I don't like it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.140 
too much and that's why I don't like it
but<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:55.900> you'll<00:01:56.900> notice<00:01:57.230> in<00:01:57.350> my<00:01:57.470> video<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:58.150> it

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
but it you'll notice in my video that it

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.450 
but it you'll notice in my video that it
really<00:01:59.390> doesn't<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.750> much<00:01:59.930> recoil<00:02:00.460> on

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
really doesn't have that much recoil on

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.490 
really doesn't have that much recoil on
the<00:02:01.820> ACR<00:02:02.240> because<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.870> Sarah<00:02:03.170> doesn't<00:02:03.350> have

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
the ACR because a Sarah doesn't have

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.310 
the ACR because a Sarah doesn't have
recoil<00:02:04.010> anyways<00:02:04.460> but<00:02:04.760> yeah<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.020> one<00:02:06.229> of

out before I call in my my Harriers cuz
I<00:04:34.990> feel<00:04:35.200> like<00:04:35.430> if<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.640> let<00:04:36.850> them<00:04:36.910> if<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.450> let

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
I feel like if you let them if you let

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.940 
I feel like if you let them if you let
them<00:04:37.690> go<00:04:37.840> by<00:04:37.990> themselves<00:04:38.170> for<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.620> little<00:04:38.830> bit

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
them go by themselves for a little bit

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.440 
them go by themselves for a little bit
the<00:04:39.280> last<00:04:39.490> longer<00:04:39.880> because<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:40.330> you

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
the last longer because if you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.240 
the last longer because if you
immediately<00:04:40.960> call<00:04:41.170> your<00:04:41.320> area<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.860> your<00:04:42.040> pave

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
immediately call your area and your pave

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.320 
immediately call your area and your pave
low<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:43.150> seems<00:04:43.480> like<00:04:44.640> they<00:04:45.640> immediately<00:04:46.090> whip

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
low it seems like they immediately whip

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.960 
low it seems like they immediately whip
out<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.510> stinger<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:48.220> know<00:04:48.340> fix<00:04:48.670> you<00:04:48.790> to

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
out that stinger you know fix you to

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.220 
out that stinger you know fix you to
kill<00:04:49.210> streaks<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.660> air<00:04:49.840> they're<00:04:50.110> gonna

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.290 
kill streaks in the air they're gonna
they're<00:04:50.530> gonna<00:04:50.650> switch<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.190> class<00:04:51.460> but

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
they're gonna switch to that class but

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.580 
they're gonna switch to that class but
if<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.420> space<00:04:52.660> them<00:04:52.840> out<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> little<00:04:53.140> bit<00:04:53.380> they

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
if you space them out a little bit they

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.940 
if you space them out a little bit they
might<00:04:53.800> actually<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:55.300> know<00:04:55.650> stick<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.800> get
