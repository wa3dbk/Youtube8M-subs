gonna<00:01:37.560> want<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.780> find<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.869> place<00:01:40.020> where<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
gonna want to find a place where the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.010 
gonna want to find a place where the
Goliath<00:01:40.800> comes<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.369> straight<00:01:41.910> down<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Goliath comes in straight down like it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.390 
Goliath comes in straight down like it
doesn't<00:01:43.350> come<00:01:43.470> into<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> angle<00:01:44.100> because

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
doesn't come into that angle because

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.950 
doesn't come into that angle because
that's<00:01:44.580> just<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.060> easiest<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.900> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that's just going to be easiest way to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.900 
that's just going to be easiest way to
do<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.580> comes<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
do this you can do it when it comes in

do this you can do it when it comes in
crooked<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.780> gonna<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.290> lot

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
crooked that's just gonna be a lot

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.170 
crooked that's just gonna be a lot
harder<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.680> why

come<00:02:20.910> straight<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.660> you're<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
come straight down and you're going to

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.199 
come straight down and you're going to
want<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> show<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.739> person<00:02:23.160> with<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.400> recon

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
want to show the person with the recon

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.610 
want to show the person with the recon
drone<00:02:24.510> where<00:02:24.900> you're<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> be<00:02:25.380> calling

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
drone where you're going to be calling

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.710 
drone where you're going to be calling
it<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.459> if<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.880> recon<00:02:27.269> drone<00:02:27.570> is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it in because if the recon drone is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.120 
it in because if the recon drone is
sitting<00:02:28.019> there<00:02:28.140> while<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.470> called<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
sitting there while you called in it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.710 
sitting there while you called in it
will<00:02:29.250> simply<00:02:29.549> move<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> marker<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.570> where

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
will simply move the marker for where

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.570 
will simply move the marker for where
the<00:02:30.900> glass<00:02:31.200> coming<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.549> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the glass coming in and then it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130 
the glass coming in and then it
obviously<00:02:33.120> won't<00:02:33.269> land<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> recon<00:02:33.959> drone

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
obviously won't land on the recon drone

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
obviously won't land on the recon drone
you<00:02:34.650> see<00:02:34.799> I'm<00:02:34.920> shooting<00:02:35.310> where<00:02:35.459> I'm<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you see I'm shooting where I'm going to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.080 
you see I'm shooting where I'm going to
be<00:02:36.980> calling<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.940> would

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
be calling it in and then I would

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.039 
be calling it in and then I would
suggest<00:02:39.120> using<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.950> paint<00:02:41.220> mode<00:02:41.459> on<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:42.209> just

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
suggest using the paint mode on if just

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.990 
suggest using the paint mode on if just
for<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.920> make<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.220> easier<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.790> where

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
for to make it easier to see where

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.250 
for to make it easier to see where
you're<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.360> shoot<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.200> want

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
you're going to shoot it then you want

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.570 
you're going to shoot it then you want
to<00:02:46.350> put<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> recon<00:02:46.920> drone<00:02:47.160> where<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.400> coming

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
to put the recon drone where it's coming

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.830 
to put the recon drone where it's coming
in<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> am<00:02:49.019> simply<00:02:49.680> land<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.370> fucking

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
in then I am simply land the fucking

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.479 
in then I am simply land the fucking
Goliath<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.560> recon<00:02:52.920> dro<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> then<00:02:53.370> I'll

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
Goliath on the recon dro and then I'll

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.160 
Goliath on the recon dro and then I'll
be<00:02:53.580> sitting<00:02:53.850> up<00:02:53.910> for<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> air<00:02:54.570> now

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
be sitting up for there in the air now

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
be sitting up for there in the air now
you<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.470> ours<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> bit<00:02:56.250> high<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.730> throw<00:02:57.090> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
you see ours is a bit high so we throw a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.550 
you see ours is a bit high so we throw a
riot<00:02:57.510> shield<00:02:57.600> down

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
riot shield down

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.190 
riot shield down
which<00:02:58.910> doesn't<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.180> no<00:03:00.450> big<00:03:00.599> deal<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.080> on

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
which doesn't it's no big deal so on

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.930 
which doesn't it's no big deal so on
down<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.739> shielding<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.280> hop<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.489> onto<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
down right shielding and hop up onto the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.809 
down right shielding and hop up onto the
barrier<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.560> then<00:03:04.560> hop<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.860> onto<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.400> fucking

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
barrier or then hop up onto the fucking

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.360 
barrier or then hop up onto the fucking
Goliath<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:07.200> hop<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.709> onto<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.040> barrier

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
Goliath and then hop up onto the barrier

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.420 
Goliath and then hop up onto the barrier
which<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.319> really<00:03:10.980> not

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
which as you can see it's really not

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
which as you can see it's really not
that<00:03:11.489> high<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.330> uh<00:03:12.569> probably<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.680> barely

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
that high it's uh probably just barely

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.320 
that high it's uh probably just barely
out<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:14.370> reach<00:03:14.489> with<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> jump<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
out of your reach with a jump of the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.630 
out of your reach with a jump of the
collab<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.530> guys<00:03:16.650> are<00:03:16.709> outside<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.430> map

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
collab then you guys are outside the map

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.040 
collab then you guys are outside the map
and<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.060> get<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.510> map<00:03:18.690> with<00:03:18.900> all

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and you can get out of a map with all

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.830 
and you can get out of a map with all
your<00:03:19.290> buddies<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:20.310> run<00:03:21.030> around<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.599> do

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
your buddies and just run around and do

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.620 
your buddies and just run around and do
all<00:03:22.019> sorts<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.349> outside<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> map<00:03:23.040> stuff<00:03:23.630> but

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
all sorts of outside the map stuff but

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.080 
all sorts of outside the map stuff but
uh<00:03:24.660> we'll<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.769> uploading<00:03:25.980> more<00:03:26.220> out<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.819> maps

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
uh we'll be uploading more out of maps

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.690 
uh we'll be uploading more out of maps
using<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.170> technique<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.099> future<00:03:29.489> and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
using this technique in the future and

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
using this technique in the future and
if<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.870> an<00:03:31.019> in-depth<00:03:31.650> enough<00:03:31.950> tutorial

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
if this was an in-depth enough tutorial

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
if this was an in-depth enough tutorial
for<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.640> guys<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:33.390> can<00:03:33.540> upload<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> better

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
for you guys we can upload at a better

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.610 
for you guys we can upload at a better
tutorial<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.130> how<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.370> do<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:37.170> technique

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
tutorial on how to do the this technique

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.050 
tutorial on how to do the this technique
but<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:37.950> figured<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.489> was<00:03:38.519> kind<00:03:38.970> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
but we figured it was kind of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.840 
but we figured it was kind of
self-explanatory<00:03:39.450> as<00:03:40.200> long<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.580> yes<00:03:41.580> follow

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
self-explanatory as long as a yes follow

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.449 
self-explanatory as long as a yes follow
these<00:03:42.180> simple<00:03:42.450> steps<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.140> if<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.380> guys<00:03:43.530> still

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
these simple steps but if you guys still

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.949 
these simple steps but if you guys still
can't<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.849> then<00:03:45.090> we'll<00:03:45.599> be<00:03:45.720> more<00:03:45.900> than

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
can't get it then we'll be more than

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.830 
can't get it then we'll be more than
happy<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.530> upload<00:03:47.370> another<00:03:47.580> tutorial<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:48.810> you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
happy to upload another tutorial for you

guys but uh be working forward to more
out<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.260> maps<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.769> future<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.220> more

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
out of maps in the future and more

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.370 
out of maps in the future and more
techniques<00:03:54.000> we've<00:03:54.299> actually<00:03:54.450> got<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> lot<00:03:55.110> for

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
techniques we've actually got a lot for

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.009
