00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this is a nice angle a little different

this is a nice angle a little different
angle<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.299> Roberto's<00:00:06.299> flat-footed<00:00:06.750> pneus

angle about Roberto's flat-footed pneus
you<00:00:08.280> can<00:00:08.429> see<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.880> player<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.179> very<00:00:10.019> far

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
you can see that the player is very far

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.919 
you can see that the player is very far
away<00:00:10.610> and<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> Longo<00:00:12.030> does<00:00:12.240> come<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> little

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
away and the Longo does come a little

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.419 
away and the Longo does come a little
bit<00:00:13.110> further<00:00:13.380> than<00:00:13.620> he<00:00:13.740> normally<00:00:13.860> does<00:00:14.250> but

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
bit further than he normally does but

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060 
bit further than he normally does but
again<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.790> nearly<00:00:15.059> far<00:00:15.360> enough<00:00:15.890> he<00:00:16.890> should

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
again not nearly far enough he should

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.650 
again not nearly far enough he should
have<00:00:17.100> been<00:00:17.220> note<00:00:17.490> near<00:00:17.730> these<00:00:17.880> hash<00:00:18.150> marks<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
have been note near these hash marks to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
have been note near these hash marks to
give<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.990> player<00:00:19.890> boys<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> girls<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
give the player boys and girls the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.279 
give the player boys and girls the
illusion<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:22.130> he<00:00:23.130> has<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.550> deke<00:00:24.019> which<00:00:25.019> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
illusion that he has to deke which you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.349 
illusion that he has to deke which you
want<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.590> create<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> then<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:27.000> again<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
want to create and then you again you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.640 
want to create and then you again you
wait<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> player<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> give<00:00:28.170> out<00:00:28.260> here

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
wait for the player to give out here

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.109 
wait for the player to give out here
which<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.949> about<00:00:29.130> eight<00:00:29.310> feet<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> hash

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
which is about eight feet from the hash

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.759 
which is about eight feet from the hash
marks<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> back<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.500> quickly

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
marks and then you back up quickly

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
marks and then you back up quickly
quickly<00:00:32.070> quickly<00:00:32.390> but<00:00:33.390> you'll<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
quickly quickly but you'll see here

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
quickly quickly but you'll see here
Roberto<00:00:34.350> stop<00:00:34.680> skating<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.610> point

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
Roberto stop skating right at this point

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
Roberto stop skating right at this point
here<00:00:36.180> his<00:00:36.930> feet<00:00:37.230> will<00:00:37.380> no<00:00:37.500> longer<00:00:37.530> move<00:00:38.010> you'll

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here his feet will no longer move you'll

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
here his feet will no longer move you'll
see<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:38.940> glide<00:00:39.210> back<00:00:39.629> which

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
see that they just glide back which

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
see that they just glide back which
means<00:00:39.989> there's<00:00:40.500> no<00:00:40.559> speed<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> he's<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
means there's no speed and he's now

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
means there's no speed and he's now
flat-footed<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.170> his<00:00:43.770> feet<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.280> mud<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
flat-footed and his feet are in mud and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.049 
flat-footed and his feet are in mud and
he's<00:00:44.910> stuck<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.530> here

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
he's stuck and you can see right here

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
he's stuck and you can see right here
because<00:00:48.059> again<00:00:48.390> he<00:00:48.480> has<00:00:48.600> no<00:00:48.750> speed<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.770> makes

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because again he has no speed that makes

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.560 
because again he has no speed that makes
it<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.309> easy<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.760> players<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> move

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
it very easy for players to move

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.369 
it very easy for players to move
laterally<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.350> him<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.550> once<00:00:54.300> again<00:00:54.420> NHL

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
laterally on him and once again NHL

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.250 
laterally on him and once again NHL
goalies<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.420> guess<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.690> understand

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
goalies I guess they don't understand

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
goalies I guess they don't understand
and<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.219> goalies<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.760> understand

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and a lot of goalies don't understand

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.580 
and a lot of goalies don't understand
and<00:01:00.329> experts<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.930> understand<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and experts don't understand that the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
and experts don't understand that the
faster<00:01:02.129> you're<00:01:02.309> moving<00:01:02.640> backwards<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
faster you're moving backwards in this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
faster you're moving backwards in this
direction<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.379> faster<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> go<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
direction the faster you go this way the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.440 
direction the faster you go this way the
easier<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> move<00:01:07.110> laterally<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
easier it is to move laterally so the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
easier it is to move laterally so the
faster<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.530> way<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.189> makes<00:01:11.490> easier

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
faster you move this way it makes easier

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
faster you move this way it makes easier
to<00:01:12.180> push<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> move<00:01:13.430> laterally<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:15.150> these

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to push and move laterally to make these

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
to push and move laterally to make these
saves<00:01:15.689> when<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.080> try<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> DQ<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.549> when

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
saves when they do try to DQ but when

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
saves when they do try to DQ but when
you<00:01:17.820> stop<00:01:18.240> skating<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.020> luongo<00:01:19.500> has<00:01:19.650> done

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you stop skating like luongo has done

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.700 
you stop skating like luongo has done
here<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> result<00:01:21.290> he<00:01:22.290> doesn't

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
here then this is the result he doesn't

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.140 
here then this is the result he doesn't
know<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.130> he<00:01:23.280> panics<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.000> goes

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
know what to do he panics and just goes

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
know what to do he panics and just goes
down<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.770> he<00:01:25.799> can't<00:01:26.159> move<00:01:26.340> fast

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
down and now he can't move fast

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.240 
down and now he can't move fast
laterally<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.530> makes<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.100> easy

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
laterally and it just makes it very easy

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
laterally and it just makes it very easy
for<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> four<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.630> around<00:01:30.840> him<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
for the four just to go around him and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
for the four just to go around him and
slip<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> mean<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.729> that's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
slip it in I mean that's a that's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
slip it in I mean that's a that's
textbook<00:01:34.170> boys<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.009> girls<00:01:35.189> how<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> play<00:01:36.299> a

textbook boys and girls how to play a
breakaway<00:01:37.280> again<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:38.939> quickly<00:01:39.450> if

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
breakaway again one more time quickly if

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.990 
breakaway again one more time quickly if
you're<00:01:40.650> backing<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.820> up

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you're backing up you got to back up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
you're backing up you got to back up
quickly<00:01:42.710> once<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> player<00:01:44.040> gets<00:01:44.220> within

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
quickly once the player gets within

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.219 
quickly once the player gets within
about<00:01:44.700> eight<00:01:44.909> feet<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.630> luengo<00:01:45.930> should

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
about eight feet of you so luengo should

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
about eight feet of you so luengo should
have<00:01:46.320> started<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.770> near<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.040> hash<00:01:47.250> marks<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
have started out near the hash marks and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600 
have started out near the hash marks and
then<00:01:48.540> once<00:01:49.140> he's<00:01:49.380> once<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> player<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.399> where

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
then once he's once the player is where

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
then once he's once the player is where
I<00:01:50.909> guess<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.659> that's<00:01:51.810> shittin<00:01:52.320> right

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I guess I think that's shittin right

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
I guess I think that's shittin right
there<00:01:53.030> Luongo<00:01:54.030> should<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.270> almost<00:01:54.479> at<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there Luongo should be almost at the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.310 
there Luongo should be almost at the
hash<00:01:55.020> marks<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.710> call<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.189> hash<00:01:56.850> marks

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
hash marks here I call it the hash marks

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.719 
hash marks here I call it the hash marks
and<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.649> should<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.549> where<00:01:59.670> he

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and now he should this is where he

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
and now he should this is where he
should<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.060> out<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:00.659> by<00:02:00.960> these<00:02:01.170> hash

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
should be out here now by these hash

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.840 
should be out here now by these hash
marks<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.219> quick<00:02:02.430> quick<00:02:02.579> quick<00:02:02.700> quick

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
marks and then quick quick quick quick

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.370 
marks and then quick quick quick quick
quick<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> same<00:02:03.600> speed<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> players

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
quick at the same speed the players

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
quick at the same speed the players
going<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.700> makes<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.060> easier<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
going and then that makes it easier to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020 
going and then that makes it easier to
go<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.439> way<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:08.879> you'll

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
go this way or that way and then you'll

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
go this way or that way and then you'll
make<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> save<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.050> his<00:02:10.229> feet<00:02:10.619> stop

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
make the save but because his feet stop

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.490 
make the save but because his feet stop
moving<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.660> his<00:02:12.989> feet<00:02:13.230> are<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
moving as you can see his feet are not

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
moving as you can see his feet are not
moving<00:02:13.800> he's<00:02:13.920> flat-footed<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.700> again<00:02:15.540> it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
moving he's flat-footed and again it's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.890 
moving he's flat-footed and again it's
easy<00:02:16.410> for<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> player<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.130> go<00:02:17.370> around<00:02:17.670> him<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
easy for the player to go around him and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.780 
easy for the player to go around him and
actually<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.920> here's<00:02:20.100> another<00:02:20.310> thing<00:02:20.610> if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
actually and here's another thing if

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.700 
actually and here's another thing if
kids<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.690> stuck<00:02:21.900> flat-footed<00:02:22.410> say

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
kids you do get stuck flat-footed say

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.080 
kids you do get stuck flat-footed say
it's<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> game<00:02:23.100> situation<00:02:23.340> rather<00:02:23.850> than<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's a game situation rather than a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.850 
it's a game situation rather than a
penalty<00:02:24.360> shot<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.810> mean<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.710> get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
penalty shot I mean you do get

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.470 
penalty shot I mean you do get
flat-footed<00:02:26.250> don't<00:02:26.640> dive<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.180> upper

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
flat-footed don't dive with your upper

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600 
flat-footed don't dive with your upper

into<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> butterfly<00:02:30.630> position<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:32.070> cover<00:02:32.280> more

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
into a butterfly position you cover more

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.949 
into a butterfly position you cover more
net<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.600> his<00:02:33.720> arm

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
net as you can see it's just his arm

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
net as you can see it's just his arm
covering<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> net<00:02:34.590> right<00:02:34.770> now<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.700> he

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
covering the net right now so what he

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.010 
covering the net right now so what he
should<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.000> done<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.450> pushed<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:36.900> his

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
should have done is pushed with his
