type<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> gel<00:00:56.579> batteries<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
type of gel batteries so it has a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
type of gel batteries so it has a
separate<00:00:58.050> lead<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.800> runs<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.129> each<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
separate lead that runs to each and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
separate lead that runs to each and
every<00:00:59.640> battery<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> charges<00:01:00.870> them

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
every battery and charges them

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
every battery and charges them
independently<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.649> we've<00:01:02.100> had<00:01:02.250> problems<00:01:02.579> in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
independently and we've had problems in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.549 
independently and we've had problems in
the<00:01:02.730> past<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.600> batteries<00:01:04.019> not

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the past with you know batteries not

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
the past with you know batteries not
lasting<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.220> charging<00:01:05.549> properly<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
lasting and charging properly and we

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.280 
lasting and charging properly and we
think<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> solve<00:01:07.140> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
think that this is going to solve that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
think that this is going to solve that

that's<00:03:13.260> something<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:13.860> we<00:03:14.070> did<00:03:14.220> that's<00:03:14.370> not

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
that's something that we did that's not

that's something that we did that's not
screen<00:03:14.790> accurate<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.480> area<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.140> filled

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
screen accurate so this area is filled

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.250 
screen accurate so this area is filled
in<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.190> sealed<00:03:17.580> all<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.090> way<00:03:18.240> around<00:03:18.570> with

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
aluminum whereas in the real car this

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.320 
aluminum whereas in the real car this
wasn't<00:03:22.260> here<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.830> went<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.370> went<00:03:23.520> right<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.940> in

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
wasn't here it went it went right on in

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.680 
wasn't here it went it went right on in
and<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.770> been<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:26.550> area<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.480> the

doing a show and you're running all this

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.659 
doing a show and you're running all this
stuff<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:39.660> hours<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.080> hours<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:41.280> need<00:04:41.460> to<00:04:41.580> be

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
stuff for hours and hours you need to be

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.490 
stuff for hours and hours you need to be
able<00:04:41.759> to<00:04:41.880> start<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.300> car<00:04:42.509> so<00:04:43.110> by<00:04:43.229> separating

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
able to start the car so by separating

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.839 
able to start the car so by separating
that<00:04:43.919> battery<00:04:44.280> from<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.550> rest<00:04:44.699> of<00:04:44.759> the
