00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.799

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.790
 times a gringo lighter so cheap 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.239
 warm it up to work with 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:10.069
 warm up neatly 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.290
 gently heat it up so as not to 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.329

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.030
 damage it at all so that later it was 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.650

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.819

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:48.069
 so here is a good krepin here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.889

 daum final already repaired 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:30.340
 We take and neatly scotch generally 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.789
 scotch does not touch 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.909
 so that there are no prints there is a stream and here 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:43.349
 so neatly where the drive is like this 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:47.710
 so here so here so here so here and 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:52.020
 so here let's go a little something so here 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:58.750
 already for sure let's go like this 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:09.310

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.740
 it remains to transport it only to the working 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:25.319
 state for this we need to scotch 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.080
 and staples 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.569
 no staples do not interfere to scotch to 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.789
 Scotch finally dreamed of a disc to 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.279

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.020
