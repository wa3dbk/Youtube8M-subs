bit like a lot of stuff went up to three
that<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.840> largely<00:00:33.350> irrelevant<00:00:33.680> to<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> meta

it's kind of a win more card but um what

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.980 
it's kind of a win more card but um what
it<00:01:37.180> then<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.479> one<00:01:38.659> giants

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
it then we have the one giants

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.389 
it then we have the one giants
Wonderstone<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:39.770> used<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.009> be<00:01:40.130> at<00:01:40.189> three

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
Wonderstone this used to be at three

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.730 
Wonderstone this used to be at three
minutes<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:40.969> 01<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.170> because<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.409> doesn't<00:01:42.649> do

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
minutes it 01 just because it doesn't do

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.010 
minutes it 01 just because it doesn't do
that<00:01:42.950> much<00:01:43.009> for<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.369> deck<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.179> tanks<00:01:44.600> anything

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
that much for the deck it tanks anything

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.069 
that much for the deck it tanks anything
with<00:01:45.229> 2000<00:01:46.189> or<00:01:46.250> less<00:01:46.509> attack<00:01:47.509> i<00:01:47.719> guess<00:01:47.899> it

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
with 2000 or less attack i guess it

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.240 
with 2000 or less attack i guess it
takes<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.859> then<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:50.689> can<00:01:51.009> get<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.130> there

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
takes that and then it can get in there

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.609 
takes that and then it can get in there
for<00:01:52.399> 13<00:01:52.729> which<00:01:52.939> isn't<00:01:53.270> awful<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:54.499> we

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
for 13 which isn't awful but then we

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.230 
for 13 which isn't awful but then we
have<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.890> sort<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.219> counterpart<00:01:55.729> obnoxious

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
have it's sort of counterpart obnoxious

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.090 
have it's sort of counterpart obnoxious
Celtic<00:01:56.570> guard<00:01:58.630> above<00:01:59.630> 2000<00:02:00.380> basically<00:02:00.829> so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
Celtic guard above 2000 basically so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.469 
Celtic guard above 2000 basically so
because<00:02:01.460> usually<00:02:01.640> when<00:02:01.969> you're<00:02:02.149> wanting<00:02:02.420> to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
because usually when you're wanting to

because usually when you're wanting to
tank<00:02:02.749> an<00:02:02.899> attack<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.469> from<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:04.070> bigger

which<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:09.530> just<00:02:09.679> thought<00:02:09.770> was<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> little<00:02:10.190> bit

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
which I just thought was a little bit

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.440 
which I just thought was a little bit
better<00:02:10.490> than<00:02:10.729> uh<00:02:11.030> more<00:02:11.780> three<00:02:12.080> stores<00:02:13.450> anyway

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
better than uh more three stores anyway

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.809 
better than uh more three stores anyway
we<00:02:14.960> run<00:02:15.170> three<00:02:15.500> marshmallow<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.490> was

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
we run three marshmallow and now I was

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.370 
we run three marshmallow and now I was
at<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.390> i<00:02:17.420> made<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.630> DECA<00:02:17.840> for<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> now

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
at one when i made the DECA for and now

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.560 
at one when i made the DECA for and now
it's<00:02:18.530> at<00:02:18.620> three<00:02:18.830> um<00:02:19.160> some<00:02:19.940> archaeologists

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
it's at three um some archaeologists

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's at three um some archaeologists
tanks<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:21.980> guess

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
tanks for you and it can I guess

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.980 
tanks for you and it can I guess
potentially<00:02:22.730> do<00:02:22.850> up<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:22.970> three<00:02:23.090> thousand<00:02:23.660> and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
potentially do up to three thousand and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.350 
potentially do up to three thousand and
damage<00:02:24.290> between<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.010> three<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:25.400> I'll

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
damage between the three of them I'll

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.360 
damage between the three of them I'll
see<00:02:26.570> I'm<00:02:26.690> marshmallow<00:02:27.170> in<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:28.420> at<00:02:30.190> three<00:02:31.190> is

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
see I'm marshmallow in it at three is

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.100 
see I'm marshmallow in it at three is
kind<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.640> funny<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.330> helps<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.840> this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
kind of funny and it helps like this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.470 
kind of funny and it helps like this
deck<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.620> deck<00:02:33.800> alone<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.460> anyway<00:02:34.700> we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
deck in this deck alone but anyway we

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.300 
deck in this deck alone but anyway we
were<00:02:35.570> onto<00:02:35.690> kuriboh<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.440> even<00:02:36.650> more<00:02:36.680> tanking

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
were onto kuriboh just even more tanking

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.340 
were onto kuriboh just even more tanking
this<00:02:37.490> can<00:02:37.700> stop<00:02:38.210> over<00:02:38.360> decades<00:02:38.540> i<00:02:38.900> guess<00:02:39.140> i<00:02:39.230> can

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
this can stop over decades i guess i can

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.250 
this can stop over decades i guess i can
stop<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.800> attack<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.060> also<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.960> can<00:02:41.990> just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
stop one attack and also we can just

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
stop one attack and also we can just
make<00:02:42.650> anything<00:02:42.980> not<00:02:43.370> divert<00:02:43.700> battle<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.330> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
make anything not divert battle so it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.390 
make anything not divert battle so it's
good<00:02:45.430> wait<00:02:46.430> um<00:02:47.140> no<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.350> can't<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:48.830> it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
good wait um no it can't do that it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.040 
good wait um no it can't do that it
can't<00:02:49.670> do<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.420> can<00:02:50.570> just<00:02:50.720> tank<00:02:50.900> one

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
can't do that it can just tank one

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.650 
can't do that it can just tank one
attack<00:02:51.320> kuriboh<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.040> not<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> good<00:02:52.370> car<00:02:52.550> but

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
attack kuriboh is not a good car but

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.770 
attack kuriboh is not a good car but
it's<00:02:53.660> better<00:02:53.870> than<00:02:53.990> these<00:02:54.920> two<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:56.360> yeah<00:02:56.510> we

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's better than these two but yeah we

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.170 
it's better than these two but yeah we
both<00:02:56.930> stopped<00:02:57.290> IDK<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:57.830> yeah<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.520> kariba<00:02:58.940> we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
both stopped IDK so yeah that kariba we

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.520 
both stopped IDK so yeah that kariba we
all<00:02:59.300> know<00:03:00.130> um<00:03:01.130> then<00:03:02.090> we<00:03:02.270> run<00:03:02.450> out<00:03:02.720> two<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.410> each

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
all know um then we run out two of each

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.420 
all know um then we run out two of each
gadget<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.910> red<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.210> green<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:06.110> yellow<00:03:06.430> this

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
gadget to red to green to yellow this

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.400 
gadget to red to green to yellow this
maintains<00:03:08.000> card<00:03:08.450> advantage<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.020> your<00:03:09.170> Slifer

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
maintains card advantage so your Slifer

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.520 
maintains card advantage so your Slifer
is<00:03:09.800> beefier<00:03:10.250> basically<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.510> also<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.380> is

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
is beefier basically and also this is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.440 
is beefier basically and also this is
just<00:03:12.710> some<00:03:12.830> good<00:03:13.010> rank<00:03:13.220> for<00:03:13.430> some<00:03:13.850> makes<00:03:14.210> ring

just some good rank for some makes ring

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.020 
just some good rank for some makes ring
for<00:03:14.630> scenes<00:03:14.960> basically<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.620> heard<00:03:16.550> flossing
