00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so at the caliper I just got a bangle on

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.960 
so at the caliper I just got a bangle on
and<00:00:03.810> made<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.380> bracket<00:00:04.799> here<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
and made this bracket here and the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.179 
and made this bracket here and the
caliper<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.020> mounted<00:00:07.410> just<00:00:07.560> through<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
caliper is mounted just through the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:08.690 
caliper is mounted just through the
bolts<00:00:08.429> here

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
bolts here

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.089 
bolts here
oh<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.970> caliper<00:00:09.240> off<00:00:09.389> ebay<00:00:09.780> from<00:00:09.840> BMI<00:00:10.620> carts

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
oh this caliper off ebay from BMI carts

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.669 
oh this caliper off ebay from BMI carts
it<00:00:11.790> was<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.120> 150<00:00:12.780> bucks<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.320> ship<00:00:13.349> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
it was about 150 bucks to ship to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.470 
it was about 150 bucks to ship to
Australia<00:00:14.040> yeah<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> know<00:00:14.580> big<00:00:14.820> expensive<00:00:15.299> but

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
Australia yeah I know big expensive but

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.810 
Australia yeah I know big expensive but
the<00:00:16.170> AUD<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.279> USD<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> very<00:00:19.050> crappy<00:00:19.410> man

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
the AUD to USD is a very crappy man

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.130 
the AUD to USD is a very crappy man
anyway<00:00:20.820> I've<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> return<00:00:21.630> spring<00:00:22.020> here

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
anyway I've got a return spring here

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.240 
anyway I've got a return spring here
just<00:00:22.380> by<00:00:22.500> drilling<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.039> hole<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
just by drilling a little hole and

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.150 
just by drilling a little hole and
putting<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> spring<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.660> returns<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:26.010> only

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
putting a spring so this returns it only

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
putting a spring so this returns it only
has<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:26.550> down<00:00:26.730> quite<00:00:27.060> only<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.869> couple<00:00:28.590> of

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
has to go down quite only a couple of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.609 
has to go down quite only a couple of
mill<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.039> break<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> electrical

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
mill to break this is electrical

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
mill to break this is electrical
connector<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.189> usually<00:00:32.309> put<00:00:32.610> wires<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.059> there

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
connector you usually put wires in there

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
connector you usually put wires in there
and<00:00:33.390> crimp<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.940> bicycle

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and crimp them and this is a bicycle

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
and crimp them and this is a bicycle
brake<00:00:36.120> cable<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.719> running<00:00:36.960> through<00:00:37.110> here

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
brake cable that's running through here

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.420 
brake cable that's running through here
or<00:00:37.829> gear<00:00:38.160> cable<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.680> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.040> bulb<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
or gear cable and it's a little bulb it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.529 
or gear cable and it's a little bulb it
at<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> end<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.270> can't<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.690> through<00:00:47.539> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
at the end so it can't go through you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
at the end so it can't go through you
can't<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.289> yeah<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.710> can't<00:00:49.950> go

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
can't really see it but yeah it can't go

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
can't really see it but yeah it can't go
through<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.700> doesn't<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> very

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
through that it doesn't have to be very

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.900 
through that it doesn't have to be very
strong<00:00:51.690> yeah<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.440> won't<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.680> through<00:00:52.910> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
strong yeah just won't go through so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090 
strong yeah just won't go through so
like<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.239> said<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> gas<00:00:54.989> line<00:00:55.230> tubing<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
like I said this is gas line tubing and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
like I said this is gas line tubing and
that's<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> cable<00:00:56.820> runs<00:00:57.000> through<00:00:58.309> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's what the cable runs through the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.750 
that's what the cable runs through the
wheels<00:01:00.000> are<00:01:00.149> mounted<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.719> bearing<00:01:01.260> blocks

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
wheels are mounted with bearing blocks

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
wheels are mounted with bearing blocks
underneath<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.510> got<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> axle<00:01:04.080> made

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
underneath and I just got the axle made

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.640 
underneath and I just got the axle made
up<00:01:04.549> from<00:01:05.549> machine<00:01:05.939> shop<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.869> sprocket<00:01:07.260> hub<00:01:07.470> at

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
up from machine shop the sprocket hub at

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.730 
up from machine shop the sprocket hub at
the<00:01:08.460> hub<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.299> sprocket<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.780> got<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the hub and the sprocket I got from a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.390 
the hub and the sprocket I got from a
local<00:01:11.040> card<00:01:11.610> shop<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> wheels<00:01:14.189> are

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
local card shop and then the wheels are

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
local card shop and then the wheels are
mounted<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.060> washers<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> either<00:01:16.140> side

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
mounted just with washers on either side

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
mounted just with washers on either side
so<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.220> don't<00:01:17.400> hit<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> bearings<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.030> then

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so they don't hit the bearings and then

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.399 
so they don't hit the bearings and then
I<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.420> tightened<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.200> tight

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
I just tightened them very very tight

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
I just tightened them very very tight
you<00:01:19.680> usually<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> tighten<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.090> every

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you usually have to tighten them every

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.990 
you usually have to tighten them every
so<00:01:21.630> often<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.229> come<00:01:22.409> loose<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so often because they come loose the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.749 
so often because they come loose the
chair<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> normal<00:01:26.280> school<00:01:26.549> chair

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
chair just like a normal school chair

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.060 
chair just like a normal school chair
and<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.780> cut<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> legs<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.530> weld<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> onto

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and I just cut the legs in weld it onto

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670 
and I just cut the legs in weld it onto
the<00:01:29.250> frame<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.049> colored<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the frame and then I also colored the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.200 
the frame and then I also colored the
chair<00:01:31.920> black<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.400> some<00:01:32.610> plastic<00:01:32.820> paint<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
chair black with some plastic paint and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
chair black with some plastic paint and
the<00:01:36.210> throttle<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.869> set<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the throttle is set up like so so I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
the throttle is set up like so so I
remove<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> governor<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.500> kept<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
remove the governor but I kept the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
remove the governor but I kept the
governor<00:01:41.159> linkage<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.750> drew<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> little

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
governor linkage and I drew a little

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
governor linkage and I drew a little
hole<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:44.000> shooting<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.390> cover<00:01:45.960> here

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
hole in my shooting and my cover here

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.859 
hole in my shooting and my cover here
and<00:01:46.850> put<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> spring<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.840> my

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and put a spring from there to my

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
and put a spring from there to my
governor<00:01:49.380> linkage<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.220> governor

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
governor linkage and you governor

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
governor linkage and you governor
linkage<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.119> three<00:01:51.390> holes<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
linkage you have three holes and the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130 
linkage you have three holes and the
next<00:01:52.799> hole<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.100> put<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.640> arm<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> bus

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
next hole I put my arm this is a bus

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
next hole I put my arm this is a bus
school<00:01:55.579> brake<00:01:56.579> cable<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> racing<00:01:57.450> bike

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
school brake cable for a racing bike

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
school brake cable for a racing bike
because<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.320> thicker<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:58.829> bulb

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
because it's a bit thicker a little bulb

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
because it's a bit thicker a little bulb
bit<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> end<00:02:00.240> allows<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.259> can't<00:02:01.469> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
bit on the end allows it so it can't go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
bit on the end allows it so it can't go
through<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> hole<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> hole

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
through that hole so that's in the hole

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
through that hole so that's in the hole
there<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> next<00:02:04.740> hole<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.909> wire

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
there and then the next hole is a wire

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.740 
there and then the next hole is a wire
from<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> hole<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:07.979> butterfly<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.300> when

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
from that hole to the butterfly so when

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
from that hole to the butterfly so when
I<00:02:09.780> throw<00:02:09.989> it'll<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.920> will<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.910> push<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
I throw it'll it will then push that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.040 
I throw it'll it will then push that

a<00:02:57.760> zip<00:02:58.209> tied<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.570> there<00:02:59.700> there's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.820> bit<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.030> gap

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
a zip tied it there there's a bit of gap

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.630 
a zip tied it there there's a bit of gap
on<00:03:02.350> here<00:03:03.510> zip<00:03:04.510> tied<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.370> then<00:03:06.370> here

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
there's no gap so I had to drill a tiny

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.280 
there's no gap so I had to drill a tiny
little<00:03:08.620> hole<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.270> currently<00:03:11.080> see<00:03:11.230> if

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
little hole in there currently see if

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.500 
little hole in there currently see if
there's<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> tiny<00:03:11.739> little<00:03:11.920> hole<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.970> just

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
there's a tiny little hole that I just

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.940 
there's a tiny little hole that I just
drew<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.989> then<00:03:14.140> put<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> zip<00:03:14.739> tie<00:03:14.920> through

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
drew it and then put the zip tie through

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.220 
drew it and then put the zip tie through
and<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> cable<00:03:16.390> has<00:03:16.690> got<00:03:16.900> one<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.140> those

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and then the cable has got one of those

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.870 
and then the cable has got one of those
electric<00:03:17.560> connectors<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:18.310> got<00:03:18.459> double

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
electric connectors but it's got double

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.320 
electric connectors but it's got double
so<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.900> holds<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.440> really<00:03:21.100> good<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.489> then<00:03:22.209> I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
so it holds it really good and then I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.940 
so it holds it really good and then I
just<00:03:22.540> welded<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.930> nut<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.170> there<00:03:23.410> with<00:03:23.590> York<00:03:23.799> C

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
just welded a nut on there with York C

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.640 
just welded a nut on there with York C
and<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:25.360> got<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.570> return<00:03:25.870> spring<00:03:26.200> set<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.470> here

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and I got a return spring set up here

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.320 
and I got a return spring set up here
from<00:03:27.310> there<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.760> then<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> little<00:03:28.090> hole<00:03:28.299> in

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
from there and then a little hole in

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.380 
from there and then a little hole in
there<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:31.269> think<00:03:32.170> that's<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:33.000> yes<00:03:34.000> pretty

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
there and I think that's it yes pretty

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
there and I think that's it yes pretty
much<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.690> so<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.950> two<00:03:36.190> horsepower

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
much it so this is a two horsepower

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.840 
much it so this is a two horsepower
engine<00:03:37.709> I'll<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:38.920> put<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> air<00:03:39.340> filter<00:03:39.700> back

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
engine I'll just put the air filter back

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.400 
engine I'll just put the air filter back
on<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:41.160> I'll<00:03:42.160> give<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.459> run<00:03:43.079> I'll<00:03:44.079> try<00:03:44.350> to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
on and I'll give it a run I'll try to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.210 
on and I'll give it a run I'll try to
anyway<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:45.390> did<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> few<00:03:46.600> burnouts<00:03:47.079> Hosey<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
anyway I did a few burnouts Hosey I
