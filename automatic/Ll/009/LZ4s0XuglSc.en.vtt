00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.170
 With the expansion of the barbecue base flag 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.680
 Welcome to BBQPitBoys.com 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 Today we are going to make bacon beer can roast chicken 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 It’s very simple to do 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 I got a 5.5 pound chicken. 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 Already cleaned 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.090
 Of course 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 You still need some beer for this dish. 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.170
 Then come a 12-ounce can of beer or 18 ounces. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 You still need some bacon 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.740
 You still need some seasoning as a spread. 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.040
 I will smear it on the chicken later. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.010
 Ok, first of all, let's put some of our salt pepper garlic. 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.580
 Salt, pepper, garlic, 2 tbsp 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 Put a little red pepper powder 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.350
 Can come 2 tablespoons 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 We also got some chili powder 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 1 tbsp or so 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 Let's put a little Cayenne chili powder 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090
 Yeast half teaspoon 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 You can do what you want. 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 Can also be used off-the-shelf 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.930
 Or try this formula very well 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.120
 Ok 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 As I said, this is a 5.5 pound chicken. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.270
 I also got a shelf with a beer can. 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.770
 Very cheap 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.610
 You buy one 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.850
 Definitely easy to use to keep the chicken fixed 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.110
 You know everything. 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.420
 Then go buy it. 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 Next, take the plaster we made and sprinkle it on the chicken. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 Red color pepper powder inside the plaster 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 There is also chili powder that will give the chicken a very good color. 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.370
 Next, click on the oven. 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.770
 We have to make a ring of carbon fire 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.900
 This requires 2 fire barrels of carbon fire 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.250
 Are all lit up 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.870
 We have to be placed along the circumference of the grill 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.450
 Very simple 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.950
 We don’t use the grilling net above. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.570
 Because we need some space to cook chicken 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.550
 Then put it in the middle of the charcoal fire in the oven 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.170
 This is very good, right? 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 Next is Bacon. 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 Very simple 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.930
 Hang the bacon along the chicken neck 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.370
 Cover the whole chicken 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.100
 This helps the oil fill the body when cooking 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.170
 This chicken needs to be grilled for 2 hours. 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.710
 So bacon becomes a natural brush 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.100
 The same is true of the beer inside. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.870
 You must have done beer roast chicken 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.520
 If you haven’t tried Bacon 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.850
 You really have to give it a try. 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 Man 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.750
 Ok 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 Bacon has been hung up 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.190
 Beer is also put in 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.700
 We have to put it on the inverted pot 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.850
 Next poke the beer 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.770
 Poke a can of beer on a beer can with an old walnut knife 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.270
 Close the lid 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.270
 Oh man 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.820
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.450
 45 minutes passed 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.900
 We have to brush the chicken 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 How do you want to brush? 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.520
 But this is very simple 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.090
 Take a can of beer 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.500
 Pouring from the neck 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.900
 Oh, it’s really simple. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.250
 Ok 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.650
 Next 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.520
 This has been baked for 2 hours. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.920
 But we still have to look at the internal temperature of the chicken. 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.250
 Insert the thermometer next to the thigh or leg bone 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.910
 The thermometer reads 175°F (79°C) 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.310
 Very good, you can take it out. 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.520
 Let the chicken sit on the chopping board for 20 minutes 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.150
 I can cut the chicken now. 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.620
 Doing such a beer can roast chicken 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.250
 Hanging a few bacon on it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250
 Definitely juicy 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.250
 Oops 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.550
 Look at this juice, everything will come out. 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.050
 Oh man 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.490
 Did you smell it? It smells like a Guuud! 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.370
 as usual 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
 We are sorry for eating in front of you. 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.750
 But we call this the privilege of the master of barbecue. 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.200
 You still go to roast chicken yourself. 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.720
吼吼Guuud! 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.220
 Man 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.020
