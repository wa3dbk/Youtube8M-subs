 after having resisted the defense well 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.220
 Italian was going to crack the absence of 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.440
 players like Paris is annie and 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.150

 other test the first test in glass 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.280
 for this limerick player who has 34 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.500
 selections and after the transformation 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.240

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.429
 was the last kick of the 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:15.710
 part but the essential had been 

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:17.240
 reached for ireland which makes a big
