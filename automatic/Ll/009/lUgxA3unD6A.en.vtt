00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like I did dead center in front of the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
like I did dead center in front of the
garage<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.380> you're<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> shoot<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
garage and you're going to shoot out the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.930 
garage and you're going to shoot out the
front<00:00:33.180> two<00:00:33.420> tires<00:00:34.430> this<00:00:35.430> makes<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> journey

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
front two tires this makes the journey

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.110 
front two tires this makes the journey
basically<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> ramp<00:00:37.520> but<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.000> most

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
basically into a ramp but the most

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
basically into a ramp but the most
important<00:00:39.600> part<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> park<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.620> good

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
important part is to park it a good

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
important part is to park it a good
distance<00:00:41.040> away<00:00:41.600> far<00:00:42.600> enough<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> when

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
distance away far enough so that when

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
distance away far enough so that when
you<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.680> knocked<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.070> bike<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.969> bike

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you get knocked off your bike the bike

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.279 
you get knocked off your bike the bike
just<00:00:45.329> Falls<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> pick<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.140> up

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
just Falls you can pick it right up

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
just Falls you can pick it right up
without<00:00:46.680> getting<00:00:47.010> sucked<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> garage

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
without getting sucked into the garage

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.090 
without getting sucked into the garage
because<00:00:48.480> once<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> set<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.440> properly<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
because once you set it up properly you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.819 
because once you set it up properly you
never<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.730> move<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> journey<00:00:51.329> again

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
never have to move this journey again

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
never have to move this journey again
okay<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> new<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> coma<00:00:54.270> check<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
okay so now I got a new a coma check it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.920 
okay so now I got a new a coma check it
out<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> I'm<00:00:58.140> gonna<00:00:58.350> drive<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.190> out

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.880

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
and you see it fall right off the bike I

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.320 
and you see it fall right off the bike I
have<00:01:06.890> plenty<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.280> room<00:01:07.430> here<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:07.970> can<00:01:08.060> just

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
have plenty of room here so I can just

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.140 
have plenty of room here so I can just
pick<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.570> up<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.490> then<00:01:10.490> now<00:01:10.759> I'm<00:01:10.880> going<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.430 
pull over to the side and I'm gonna
order<00:01:13.430> an<00:01:13.759> adder<00:01:14.060> in<00:01:14.630> order<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.170> include

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
order an adder in order to include

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.410 
order an adder in order to include
increase<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.100> value<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.460> my<00:01:16.670> bike<00:01:19.420> basically

that with a rebel just to help move the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.760 
that with a rebel just to help move the
glitch<00:01:50.030> along<00:01:50.330> faster<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.380> i'm<00:01:51.470> just<00:01:51.500> going<00:01:51.710> to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
glitch along faster so i'm just going to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.290 
glitch along faster so i'm just going to
go<00:01:51.890> ahead<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.190> order<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.429> rebel<00:01:52.819> and<00:01:52.909> put<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.179> in
