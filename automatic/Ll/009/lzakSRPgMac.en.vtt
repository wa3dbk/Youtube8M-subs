a criticism that the Campagna kept on

though that's sort of fizzled out a
little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.600> mean<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> should<00:02:04.290> happen

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
story is very very simply played up

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.690 
story is very very simply played up
being<00:02:52.410> tom<00:02:52.620> mcrae<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.160> given<00:02:53.430> something<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
being tom mcrae was given something a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
being tom mcrae was given something a
bit<00:02:53.820> simple<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.870> worked<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.200> kind<00:02:55.380> of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bit simple it really worked out kind of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.440 
bit simple it really worked out kind of
well<00:02:55.680> there<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.070> no<00:02:56.100> defensive<00:02:56.910> body<00:02:57.090> which

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
well there was no defensive body which

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.240 
well there was no defensive body which
is<00:02:57.630> good<00:02:57.810> i<00:02:57.840> think<00:02:57.930> sometimes<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.710> don't

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
is good i think sometimes so you don't

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.830 
is good i think sometimes so you don't
need<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.760> during<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> doctor<00:03:00.450> who<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.690> just

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
need that during the doctor who you just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.930 
need that during the doctor who you just
need<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.290> story<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.130> get<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.460> with<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.790> that

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
need a story just to get on with in that

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.810 
need a story just to get on with in that
and<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:04.230> know<00:03:04.320> I've<00:03:04.410> watched<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.250> red<00:03:05.520> other

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
and you know I've watched the red other

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.330 
and you know I've watched the red other
people<00:03:06.120> sweet<00:03:06.300> saying<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.710> know<00:03:07.860> they

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
people sweet saying it was you know they

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270 
people sweet saying it was you know they
didn't<00:03:08.670> contain<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> self<00:03:09.450> story<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:10.020> which<00:03:11.010> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
didn't contain a self story on which is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.520 
didn't contain a self story on which is
good<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.180> contained<00:03:12.870> its<00:03:13.080> own<00:03:13.230> source

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
good because it contained its own source

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.350 
good because it contained its own source
story<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> classic<00:03:14.730> Doctor<00:03:15.060> Who<00:03:15.150> which

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
story like the classic Doctor Who which

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.000 
story like the classic Doctor Who which
is<00:03:15.510> actually<00:03:15.720> brilliant<00:03:16.140> figured<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.770> I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
is actually brilliant figured that I

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340 
is actually brilliant figured that I
think<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.730> tom<00:03:17.970> mcrae<00:03:18.180> did<00:03:18.600> borrow<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.050> couple

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
think that tom mcrae did borrow a couple

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.900 
think that tom mcrae did borrow a couple
of<00:03:19.500> elements<00:03:19.650> though<00:03:20.040> from<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> mine<00:03:20.490> Robert

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
of elements though from the mine Robert

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.400 
of elements though from the mine Robert
from<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.240> classic<00:03:21.630> her<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.260> that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
from the classic her and then and that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.990 
from the classic her and then and that
ain't<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.920> bad<00:03:22.950> thing<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.580> think<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.880> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
ain't a bad thing I think that is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.340 
ain't a bad thing I think that is
actually<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> really<00:03:24.570> really<00:03:24.780> good<00:03:24.959> finger

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
actually a really really good finger

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.810 
actually a really really good finger
when<00:03:25.500> he<00:03:25.560> put<00:03:25.830> it<00:03:25.920> forward<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> idea<00:03:26.760> is

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
when he put it forward and the idea is

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.940 
when he put it forward and the idea is
now<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.240> mean<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.020> a<00:03:28.050> wonderful<00:03:28.500> finger<00:03:28.770> just

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
now I mean it's a wonderful finger just

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.580 
now I mean it's a wonderful finger just
to<00:03:29.040> put<00:03:29.280> forward<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.790> have<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.209> say<00:03:30.590> really

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
to put forward that I have to say really

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.530 
to put forward that I have to say really
really<00:03:31.709> polished<00:03:32.190> together<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:33.000> just

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
who really put to the performances Rory

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.080 
who really put to the performances Rory
really<00:03:39.630> would<00:03:39.780> calculate<00:03:40.760> she's<00:03:41.760> really

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
really would calculate she's really

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.310 
really would calculate she's really
really<00:03:42.270> good<00:03:42.450> though<00:03:42.600> as<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.080> more

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
really good though as well it's more

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.830 
really good though as well it's more
their<00:03:43.740> performances<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.640> really<00:03:45.330> stand<00:03:45.630> out

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
their performances that really stand out

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.930 
their performances that really stand out
in<00:03:45.990> this<00:03:46.080> one<00:03:46.260> matt<00:03:46.470> still<00:03:47.040> does<00:03:47.340> really<00:03:47.730> well

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
in this one matt still does really well

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.790 
in this one matt still does really well
as<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> doctor<00:03:48.420> by<00:03:48.540> me<00:03:48.690> after<00:03:49.050> I've<00:03:49.200> imagine

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
as a doctor by me after I've imagine

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.890 
as a doctor by me after I've imagine
it's<00:03:50.370> more<00:03:50.520> their<00:03:51.060> performances<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.750> you're

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
it's more their performances that you're

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900 
it's more their performances that you're
more<00:03:52.020> focused<00:03:52.260> on<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.740> one<00:03:52.920> I'd<00:03:53.100> say<00:03:53.130> they

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
more focused on this one I'd say they

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.330 
more focused on this one I'd say they
really<00:03:54.420> pulled<00:03:54.959> in<00:03:55.170> really<00:03:55.740> quite<00:03:55.920> well<00:03:56.130> I

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
really pulled in really quite well I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.140 
really pulled in really quite well I
think<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.360> really<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:58.320> quite<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.830> episode

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
think it really is quite a good episode

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.310 
think it really is quite a good episode
however<00:04:00.150> though<00:04:00.270> not<00:04:00.510> my<00:04:00.690> favorite<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
however though not my favorite of the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.770 
however though not my favorite of the
series<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.860> still<00:04:02.160> belongs<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.390> doctor's

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
series it still belongs to the doctor's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.710 
series it still belongs to the doctor's
wife<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:05.459> good<00:04:05.640> man<00:04:05.850> goes<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> war<00:04:06.270> so<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
wife and the good man goes to war so I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.000 
wife and the good man goes to war so I
think<00:04:06.840> those<00:04:07.080> two<00:04:07.140> episodes<00:04:07.650> we're<00:04:07.770> still

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
think those two episodes we're still

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.890 
think those two episodes we're still
kind<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> bit<00:04:08.550> stronger<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.510> over

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
kind of like a bit stronger but over

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.479 
kind of like a bit stronger but over
