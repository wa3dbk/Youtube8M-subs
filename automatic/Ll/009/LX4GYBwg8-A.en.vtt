I<00:00:08.340> was<00:00:09.340> metal<00:00:09.610> detecting<00:00:10.150> in<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:11.320> field<00:00:11.590> and<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
I was metal detecting in a field and I

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.510 
I was metal detecting in a field and I
come<00:00:13.930> across<00:00:14.099> some<00:00:15.099> mole<00:00:15.880> hills<00:00:16.119> and<00:00:17.520> thought

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
come across some mole hills and thought

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.070 
come across some mole hills and thought
well<00:00:18.640> marvel<00:00:19.090> I'll<00:00:19.360> don't<00:00:19.570> normally<00:00:19.900> mail

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
detect mole hills so I decided well just

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.880 
detect mole hills so I decided well just
once<00:00:22.989> i'll<00:00:23.200> do<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:23.680> for<00:00:23.739> what<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:26.320> went<00:00:26.649> over
