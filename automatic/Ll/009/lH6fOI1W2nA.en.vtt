a sticky piston and then what you're

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.040 
a sticky piston and then what you're
gonna<00:00:15.290> want<00:00:15.470> to<00:00:15.530> do<00:00:15.680> is<00:00:15.980> just<00:00:16.220> dig<00:00:16.700> out<00:00:17.050> like

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
gonna want to do is just dig out like

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.410 
gonna want to do is just dig out like
one<00:00:18.290> by<00:00:18.440> seven<00:00:18.830> area<00:00:19.070> like<00:00:19.280> that<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:19.760> then

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
one by seven area like that and then

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.960 
one by seven area like that and then
skip<00:00:20.840> over<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.110> block<00:00:21.320> like<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.010> do<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
skip over a block like this and do the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.080 
skip over a block like this and do the
same<00:00:23.180> exact<00:00:23.450> thing<00:00:24.610> and<00:00:25.610> they're<00:00:25.730> gonna<00:00:25.850> fill

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
same exact thing and they're gonna fill

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.030 
same exact thing and they're gonna fill
it<00:00:26.210> up<00:00:26.270> with<00:00:26.420> sticky<00:00:26.900> pistons<00:00:27.290> facing<00:00:27.529> upwards

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:43.170 

then<00:00:34.040> cover<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:34.850> sticky<00:00:35.030> pistons<00:00:35.450> with<00:00:35.630> dirt

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.010 

then<00:00:44.180> you<00:00:44.270> want<00:00:44.420> you're<00:00:44.510> gonna<00:00:44.630> want<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.810> do<00:00:44.930> is

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
then you want you're gonna want to do is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.980 
then you want you're gonna want to do is
just<00:00:45.140> block<00:00:45.470> off<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.860> edges<00:00:46.100> like<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:46.990> you

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
just block off the edges like this you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.060 
just block off the edges like this you
don't<00:00:48.140> have<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.350> put<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.530> stairs<00:00:48.800> there<00:00:49.040> I

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
don't have to put the stairs there I

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.380 
don't have to put the stairs there I
just<00:00:49.220> think<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:49.610> makes<00:00:49.880> it<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.120> little<00:00:50.270> bit

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
just think it makes it a little bit

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.680 
just think it makes it a little bit
easier<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.780> get<00:00:50.900> up<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:52.340> then<00:00:52.600> you're<00:00:53.600> gonna

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
easier to get up and then you're gonna

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.720 
easier to get up and then you're gonna
need<00:00:53.810> some<00:00:54.020> water<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:57.470> just<00:00:58.070> fill<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.670> up

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
need some water and just fill that up

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.600 
need some water and just fill that up
with<00:00:58.880> water<00:00:59.530> they<00:01:00.530> need<00:01:00.740> a<00:01:00.770> half<00:01:00.980> block<00:01:01.340> just

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
with water they need a half block just

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.119 
with water they need a half block just
get<00:01:01.910> stone<00:01:02.780> slab<00:01:03.140> or<00:01:03.380> sandstone<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.950> side

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
get stone slab or sandstone the side

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.230 
get stone slab or sandstone the side
doesn't<00:01:04.430> really<00:01:04.549> matter<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:07.210> put<00:01:08.210> that

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
doesn't really matter and then put that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.960 
doesn't really matter and then put that
over<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.689> water<00:01:08.869> like<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.670> then<00:01:13.939> just

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
over the water like this and then just

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.880 
over the water like this and then just
you're<00:01:14.659> gonna<00:01:14.750> ignore<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.170> fertilize<00:01:15.680> this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
you're gonna ignore that fertilize this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.000 
you're gonna ignore that fertilize this
ground<00:01:16.189> right<00:01:16.280> here

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.740 

and<00:01:21.370> we'll<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.820> put<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.120> seeds<00:01:22.330> down<00:01:22.540> right

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
and we'll just put the seeds down right

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.060 
and we'll just put the seeds down right
now<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.260> when<00:01:23.500> we're<00:01:23.620> done<00:01:23.740> with<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.980> other

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
you're just gonna want to put a lever

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.930 
you're just gonna want to put a lever
right<00:01:32.050> there<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.890> now<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.700> get<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.820> the

right there and now I can get to the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.090 
right there and now I can get to the
redstone<00:01:34.330> part<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.110> just<00:01:35.800> want<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:35.980> go

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
redstone part so you just want to go

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.510 
redstone part so you just want to go
like<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.770> make<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.800> redstone<00:01:39.190> fail

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
like this and make a redstone fail

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460 
like this and make a redstone fail
coming<00:01:39.880> down<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:40.480> split<00:01:40.870> off<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.290> two

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
coming down and then split off in two

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.520 
coming down and then split off in two
directions<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:46.050> you're<00:01:47.050> going<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.440> just

directions and then you're going to just

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.790 
directions and then you're going to just
dig<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.980> two<00:01:48.460> by<00:01:48.970> seven<00:01:49.840> over<00:01:50.170> however<00:01:50.380> long<00:01:50.560> you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
dig a two by seven over however long you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.070 
dig a two by seven over however long you
made<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:54.100> here<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.670> then<00:01:55.570> get<00:01:55.930> some

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
made it down here and then get some

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.540 
made it down here and then get some
repeaters<00:01:56.470> and<00:02:00.690> place<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:02.110> and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
repeaters and place it like that and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.700 
repeaters and place it like that and
bring<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.670> redstone<00:02:04.090> down<00:02:04.380> all<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.590> way<00:02:05.650> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
bring the redstone down all the way to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.030 
bring the redstone down all the way to
the<00:02:05.890> end<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.990> do<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.200> same<00:02:08.440> exact<00:02:08.800> thing

the end and then do the same exact thing

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.110 
the end and then do the same exact thing
on<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> other<00:02:09.280> side

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.310 

all<00:02:17.120> right<00:02:17.300> now<00:02:17.450> where<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.720> gonna<00:02:17.810> need<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.170> do

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
all right now where you gonna need to do

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200 
all right now where you gonna need to do
is<00:02:18.590> just<00:02:18.950> if<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.340> made<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.640> like<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.940> long

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
is just if you made it like this long

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.680 
is just if you made it like this long
you're<00:02:20.960> gonna<00:02:21.080> want<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.320> put<00:02:21.410> repeaters<00:02:22.690> right

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
you're gonna want to put repeaters right

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.630 
you're gonna want to put repeaters right
there<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.440> right<00:02:24.710> there<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.160> reaches<00:02:25.520> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
there and right there so it reaches the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.050 
there and right there so it reaches the
end<00:02:25.990> now<00:02:26.990> let's<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.440> if<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.650> works<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.460> if

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
end now let's just see if it works so if

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.310 
end now let's just see if it works so if
we<00:02:29.180> press<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:31.660> shoots<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:32.960> that<00:02:33.110> that's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
we press this shoots up like that that's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.940 
we press this shoots up like that that's
perfect

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
perfect

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.520 
perfect
all<00:02:34.580> right<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.750> let's<00:02:35.780> MIT<00:02:36.230> let's<00:02:36.380> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
all right so now let's MIT let's just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.210 
all right so now let's MIT let's just
clean<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.130> little<00:02:37.160> bit<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.890> I'll<00:02:40.100> just

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
clean it up a little bit so I'll just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:56.890 
clean it up a little bit so I'll just
fast-forward<00:02:40.640> through<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.480> faster<00:02:55.900> all

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
fast-forward through this a faster all

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.870 
fast-forward through this a faster all
right<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:57.500> now<00:02:57.800> let's<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:58.040> see<00:02:58.310> if<00:02:58.340> how<00:02:58.760> it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
right so now let's just see if how it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.800 
right so now let's just see if how it
works<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.950> see<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.580> plant<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.940> seeds<00:03:02.210> I<00:03:04.810> was

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
works so see you plant the seeds I was

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.300 
works so see you plant the seeds I was
like<00:03:05.960> get<00:03:06.140> some<00:03:06.320> bone<00:03:06.500> meal<00:03:08.680> plan<00:03:09.680> sees<00:03:10.010> you

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
like get some bone meal plan sees you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.990 
like get some bone meal plan sees you
come<00:03:10.520> back<00:03:11.140> when<00:03:12.140> they're<00:03:12.380> like<00:03:12.590> done

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.510 

and<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.120> push<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.510> lever<00:03:22.280> shoots<00:03:23.280> up

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
and you push this the lever shoots up

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.850 
and you push this the lever shoots up
you<00:03:24.300> collect<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.780> these<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.650> cool

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
you collect all of these and a cool

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.320 
you collect all of these and a cool
thing<00:03:25.890> about<00:03:26.069> this<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.819> don't<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
thing about this is you don't have to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.130 
thing about this is you don't have to
like<00:03:27.680> re<00:03:28.680> fertilize<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.459> ground<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.870> right

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
like re fertilize the ground so right

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.340 
like re fertilize the ground so right
after<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.470> do<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:33.170> after<00:03:34.170> you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
collect it you just push it down put all

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.949

the<00:03:36.360> seeds<00:03:36.660> back<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:38.270> wait<00:03:39.270> for<00:03:39.480> them<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.600> grow

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the seeds back in wait for them to grow

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:40.520 
the seeds back in wait for them to grow
again

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
again

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
simple to make and then you can design

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.490
