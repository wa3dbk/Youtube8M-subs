00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.780
 hi everybody with you and today i am 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.660
 tell you how to update your and from 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.759
 in this case the device is on ios 8 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.320
 firmware was officially literally 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.200
 recently a couple of days ago 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 Grigory those who want can upgrade it 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.150
 and almost illegally so let's say 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.770
 as official it was only 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.100
 developers could well do it 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.810
 ordinary users downloading at the same time 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.309
 special firmware thing is that 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.250
 now the first thing to do is 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.950
 Download the newest version of aytyuns 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.590
 then we will have to download from this 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.990
 I will throw off the site in the description 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.820
 firmware for your device our 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.850
 case it is slower the most important thing 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.430
 To make the model fit the firmware for your 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 device models because valid 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.180
 let's move both your varieties 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.620
 the kind we are exactly the models you 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.360
 can learn on the back cover 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.489
 devices down there in small print 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 written some still osmosis 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.130
 the device of our case is 455 I already have it 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.200
 downloaded further we run it ourselves 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.869
 press the refresh button while 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.060
 clamping the left shift click and select 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 the file that we want to update our 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.359
 turn on it is on the desktop 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.399
 here about this one of abs I update to 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.469
 Sorry, I will not do this to anyone 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.090
 I do not advise because you can do 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.369
 from your device, be strong because 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.350
 all these devices require exactly 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.090
 developer account force upgrade 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.369
 questions like that with such a mentor you 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.929
 rather, do everything and either bricks or 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.999
 you make a device that will 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.219
 some time unsuitable but you can 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.899
 no problem and now walk on 71 one but 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.429
 if we allow firmware in my case, I 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.469
 I won't risk doing it at all 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.050
 because i am very suspicious 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.850
 call the firmware I wrote again 2780 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.230
 i don't want it was because if this 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.750
 did i rather make all bricks 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.730
 I heard a sound and you will not covet it either 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 do not not update your devices like 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.960
 methods how much you make either a brick 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.010
 or you might get something but it 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.380
 better not wait 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.150
 the official firmware version but here I am 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.080
 told how to update but to anyone it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.420
 I do not advise doing 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.890
 And in general, then Jackson themselves sign 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.890
 likes and like bets
