that were presented to him throughout
this<00:01:09.659> camp<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> coaching<00:01:10.950> staff

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this camp but i think the coaching staff

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.580 
this camp but i think the coaching staff
was<00:01:11.400> really<00:01:11.700> high<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.150> him<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.409> his

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
was really high on him and really his

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
was really high on him and really his
willingness<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.310> learn<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.850> he's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> guy<00:01:15.330> i

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
willingness to learn so he's a guy i

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.719 
willingness to learn so he's a guy i
think<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:15.990> stick<00:01:16.320> around<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:17.340> another

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
think is gonna stick around now another

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.300 
think is gonna stick around now another
defensive<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.509> Derrell<00:01:19.409> gavin's<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
defensive back Derrell gavin's out of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.880 
defensive back Derrell gavin's out of
boise<00:01:21.000> state<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:22.020> Jamar<00:01:22.350> Taylor<00:01:22.380> his

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
boise state now Jamar Taylor his

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.380 
boise state now Jamar Taylor his
teammate<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.490> most<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> pre-draft

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
teammate got most of the pre-draft

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
teammate got most of the pre-draft
attention<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:25.890> Gavin's<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
attention but I think Gavin's is a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.289 
attention but I think Gavin's is a
pretty<00:01:26.610> talented<00:01:26.880> player<00:01:27.390> he<00:01:28.380> missed<00:01:28.590> most<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
pretty talented player he missed most of

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
pretty talented player he missed most of
2011<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> knee<00:01:30.720> injury<00:01:30.900> after<00:01:31.409> three

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
2011 with a knee injury after three

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.450 
2011 with a knee injury after three
games<00:01:32.659> terrible<00:01:33.659> knee<00:01:33.750> injury<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.460> those

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
games terrible knee injury but those

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
games terrible knee injury but those
three<00:01:35.880> games<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.659> three<00:01:36.689> interceptions

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
three games he had three interceptions

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
three games he had three interceptions
so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> speaks

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so I think that's you know that speaks

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
so I think that's you know that speaks
volumes<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> guy<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.430> capable

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
volumes about what this guy is capable

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.929 
volumes about what this guy is capable
of<00:01:42.119> doing<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:43.110> 2012<00:01:43.920> he<00:01:44.100> had<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.610> equally

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of doing in 2012 he had an equally

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.929 
of doing in 2012 he had an equally
pretty<00:01:45.750> good<00:01:45.960> season<00:01:46.409> two<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> course<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
pretty good season two but of course you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.429 
pretty good season two but of course you
know<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.180> knee<00:01:48.479> injury<00:01:48.750> did<00:01:48.990> slow<00:01:49.259> him<00:01:49.409> down

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
know that knee injury did slow him down

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
know that knee injury did slow him down
I<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.369> he's<00:01:50.579> fully<00:01:50.820> recovered<00:01:50.909> we

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I think now that he's fully recovered we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.080 
I think now that he's fully recovered we
could<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.590> him<00:01:53.159> grow<00:01:53.610> into<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
could really see him grow into the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.990
