00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.489
 you start to work to drive and I know 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 that from this video many are going to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 take this video can not 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 interact with whistled in this case what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.390
 what we have to do is very simple 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.640
 we have to enter what is adjustments 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.909
 within adjustments we are going to enter the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.740
 option that is called general and in general 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.710
 when pressing it there is an option 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.060
 which is called grabbing and we press go and and 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.890

 account that spoken answers appear 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.990
 my data and raise to talk is to say 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.280
 so you can interact with the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.770
 microphone that is on the bottom 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.440

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.940
