training and he says for incline bench

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.740 
training and he says for incline bench
curls<00:00:27.230> incline<00:00:27.680> bicep<00:00:28.070> curls<00:00:28.340> what<00:00:29.060> angle<00:00:29.570> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.779 
curls incline bicep curls what angle of
bench<00:00:30.019> should<00:00:30.410> use<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.130> is<00:00:31.460> it<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> same

thanks<00:00:35.960> alright<00:00:36.920> good<00:00:37.190> question<00:00:37.730> and

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
thanks alright good question and

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.960 
thanks alright good question and
personally<00:00:39.379> I<00:00:39.410> like<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:39.890> use<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.370> steeper

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
personally I like to use a steeper

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.140 
personally I like to use a steeper
incline<00:00:41.150> for<00:00:42.100> incline<00:00:43.100> bicep<00:00:43.549> curls<00:00:43.909> than<00:00:44.120> I

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
incline for incline bicep curls than I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.930 
incline for incline bicep curls than I
would<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:44.449> an<00:00:44.960> incline<00:00:45.379> bench<00:00:45.409> press<00:00:45.979> and<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
would for an incline bench press and the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.630 
would for an incline bench press and the
reason<00:00:47.239> for<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.900> because<00:00:48.489> when<00:00:49.489> you're

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
reason for this is because when you're

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.910 
reason for this is because when you're
doing<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:50.089> bicep<00:00:50.360> curl<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:51.409> don't<00:00:51.619> need<00:00:51.769> to

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
doing a bicep curl you don't need to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.000 
doing a bicep curl you don't need to
over<00:00:52.309> stretch<00:00:52.549> your<00:00:53.210> biceps<00:00:53.750> we<00:00:54.409> over<00:00:54.739> stretch

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
over stretch your biceps we over stretch

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.770 
over stretch your biceps we over stretch
anything<00:00:55.400> is<00:00:55.549> just<00:00:55.790> increasing<00:00:56.390> your<00:00:56.420> risk<00:00:56.659> of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
anything is just increasing your risk of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.990 
anything is just increasing your risk of
injury<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.350> just<00:00:57.830> want<00:00:57.979> a<00:00:58.159> moderate<00:00:58.640> stretch

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
injury you just want a moderate stretch

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500 
injury you just want a moderate stretch
so<00:00:59.619> slightly<00:01:00.619> angled<00:01:01.280> back<00:01:01.460> from<00:01:02.089> an<00:01:02.299> upright

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so slightly angled back from an upright

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.229 
so slightly angled back from an upright
bench<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:03.199> plenty<00:01:03.680> does<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.670> allow<00:01:04.970> your

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
bench is plenty does that allow your

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.330 
bench is plenty does that allow your
arms<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.720> travel<00:01:06.200> slightly<00:01:06.590> past<00:01:06.830> your<00:01:07.070> torso

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
arms to travel slightly past your torso

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.160 
arms to travel slightly past your torso
and<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.760> pulley<00:01:08.030> stretch<00:01:08.390> up<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.659> biceps<00:01:09.049> in

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and a pulley stretch up the biceps in

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.450 
and a pulley stretch up the biceps in
the<00:01:09.229> bottom<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.920> don't<00:01:10.100> need<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.400> it

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
the bottom you don't need to have it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.450 
the bottom you don't need to have it
weigh<00:01:10.960> hyper-extended<00:01:12.100> because<00:01:13.100> that's<00:01:13.280> just

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
weigh hyper-extended because that's just

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.880 
weigh hyper-extended because that's just
again<00:01:13.850> increasing<00:01:14.509> your<00:01:14.570> risk<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.899> injury<00:01:15.079> so

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
again increasing your risk of injury so

and show you exactly how to self

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.399 
and show you exactly how to self

more strain on the shoulder joint and
it's<00:01:53.179> not<00:01:53.329> really<00:01:53.479> gonna<00:01:53.689> do<00:01:53.899> anything<00:01:54.469> as<00:01:54.679> far

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's not really gonna do anything as far

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.830 
it's not really gonna do anything as far
as<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.189> biceps<00:01:55.579> are<00:01:55.700> concerned<00:01:56.030> because<00:01:56.179> once

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
as the biceps are concerned because once

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.169 
as the biceps are concerned because once
your<00:01:56.990> arms<00:01:57.350> are<00:01:57.590> straight<00:01:57.829> that's<00:01:58.249> basically

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
your arms are straight that's basically

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.580 
your arms are straight that's basically
it<00:01:59.270> has<00:01:59.359> much<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.719> a<00:01:59.810> stretch<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.289> you're<00:02:00.409> going

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it has much of a stretch as you're going

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.080 
it has much of a stretch as you're going
to<00:02:00.679> get<00:02:00.829> in<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.189> biceps<00:02:01.609> so<00:02:01.700> there's<00:02:01.969> really

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
to get in the biceps so there's really
