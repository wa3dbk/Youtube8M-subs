ground all you need to do is pull the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
ground all you need to do is pull the
left<00:00:42.450> analog<00:00:42.629> stick<00:00:42.840> backwards<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> you'll

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
left analog stick backwards and you'll

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760 
left analog stick backwards and you'll
stop<00:00:44.370> gliding<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> sky<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.559> very

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
stop gliding up into the sky it is very

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
stop gliding up into the sky it is very
easy<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.850> also<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.180> performed

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
easy there it can also be performed

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.439 
easy there it can also be performed
upside<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> honest<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.270> isn't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
upside down and to be honest this isn't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.619 
upside down and to be honest this isn't
much<00:00:54.690> harder<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.530> looks<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.300> much<00:00:57.300> cooler

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
much harder and it looks so much cooler

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900 
much harder and it looks so much cooler
all<00:00:58.620> we've<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> rotate<00:00:59.579> your

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
all we've got to do is rotate your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.689 
all we've got to do is rotate your
character<00:01:00.329> 180<00:01:00.989> degrees<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.190> making<00:01:02.489> sure

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
character 180 degrees but making sure

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.189 
character 180 degrees but making sure
that<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> wheels<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.329> still<00:01:03.660> facing<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that the wheels have still facing the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
that the wheels have still facing the
same<00:01:04.350> direction<00:01:05.030> kind<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> fucking<00:01:06.570> odd<00:01:06.750> for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
same direction kind of fucking odd for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
same direction kind of fucking odd for
car<00:01:07.380> gliding<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.159> need<00:01:08.340> loads<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> speed<00:01:09.180> so

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
car gliding you need loads of speed so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.429 
car gliding you need loads of speed so
you're<00:01:09.570> probably<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you're probably going to want to do it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.289 
you're probably going to want to do it
on<00:01:10.560> single<00:01:10.979> player<00:01:11.100> using<00:01:11.700> Franklin<00:01:12.090> special

on single player using Franklin special
ability<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> am<00:01:13.830> doing<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:15.270> soon

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
ability like I am doing now and as soon

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
ability like I am doing now and as soon
as<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> hit<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> ramp<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> need<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> do

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
as you hit the ramp all you need to do

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
as you hit the ramp all you need to do
is<00:01:17.280> push<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> car<00:01:17.909> forward<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> left

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
is push the car forward using the left

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
is push the car forward using the left
analog<00:01:19.439> stick<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.689> trying<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.840> best

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
analog stick like this trying your best

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
analog stick like this trying your best
to<00:01:22.140> keep<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.470> car<00:01:22.680> under<00:01:22.799> control<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.420> can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
to keep a car under control as you can

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
to keep a car under control as you can
see<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.020> makes<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.409> car<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.770> flying<00:01:26.159> much

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
see this makes your car go flying much

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
see this makes your car go flying much
further<00:01:27.119> than<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.570> normally<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.770> seems

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
further than it would normally it seems

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
further than it would normally it seems
simple<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.759> trust<00:01:30.390> me<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.170> difficult

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
simple but trust me is pretty difficult

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
simple but trust me is pretty difficult
without<00:01:32.310> gliding<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> same<00:01:33.720> amount

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
without gliding but with the same amount

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
without gliding but with the same amount
of<00:01:34.140> speed<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> even<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.400> half<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
of speed you don't even go half the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
of speed you don't even go half the
distance<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> I'll<00:01:37.350> flag<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.770> Boise<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.250> you'll

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
distance so I'll flag in Boise if you'll

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.750 
distance so I'll flag in Boise if you'll
do<00:01:38.579> some<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.909> stunts

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760
