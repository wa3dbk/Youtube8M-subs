you the phone fits you can see here I've
got<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.340> 3800<00:01:29.340> extended<00:01:29.939> battery<00:01:30.329> with<00:01:30.540> some

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
got the 3800 extended battery with some

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.850 
got the 3800 extended battery with some
carbon<00:01:31.710> wrapping<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:33.170> just<00:01:34.170> slop<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
carbon wrapping on it just slop that in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
carbon wrapping on it just slop that in
there<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.689> fits<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.900> there

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
there as you can see fits in there

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.429 
there as you can see fits in there
perfectly<00:01:38.900> obviously<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.960> will<00:01:40.020> fit<00:01:40.259> without

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
perfectly obviously it will fit without

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.539 
perfectly obviously it will fit without
this<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.100> well<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> take

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
this as well you probably have to take

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
this as well you probably have to take
cases<00:01:44.939> off<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.450> fit<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.259> can

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cases off to fit it in because you can

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.270 
cases off to fit it in because you can
see<00:01:46.909> there's<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.899> room<00:01:49.500> around<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
see there's not much room around the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.940 
see there's not much room around the
sides<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.570> dock<00:01:53.390> but<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.799> see

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
sides of this dock but as you can see

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
sides of this dock but as you can see
holds<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> phone<00:01:56.579> nicely<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.149> quite<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
holds the phone nicely it's quite a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.730 
holds the phone nicely it's quite a
steep<00:01:58.320> angle<00:01:59.299> but<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.200> always<00:02:01.350> offset

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
steep angle but you could always offset

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
steep angle but you could always offset
that<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> didn't<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.579> too

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that if you didn't really like it too

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.080 
that if you didn't really like it too
much<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.509> tilt<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.610> dock<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.939> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
much you just tilt the dock up like this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.580 
much you just tilt the dock up like this
it<00:02:06.930> doesn't<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.409> any<00:02:07.799> rubber<00:02:08.700> feet<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.720> it
