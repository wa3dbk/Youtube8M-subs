Hello everybody! Now we’re in the Valve office where

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:22.824
the first day of group stage of the International

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:27.319
tournament is held. I’ll make a little review of

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.214
gaming zone. Unfortunately it won’t be the review

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.403
of the whole office, but I’ll make it on Tuesday or

00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:38.094
Wednesday, because it’s forbidden to walk

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:39.945
everywhere you want. There lots of cool stuff, as

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.837
you can see these printed ones. Here you can see a

00:00:42.837 --> 00:00:48.536
very famous person – Fill Coul, he came to

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:51.049
Ukraine to make film about Dendi, and you can read in my blog

00:00:51.049 --> 00:01:00.176
about it. Here is the storage for every team’s devices.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:04.974
Every team has its own box where it can keep its printed devices.

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:08.287
And every team has its own SSD drive,

00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:12.138
where there are all necessary settings, so they don’t

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.678
need to make settings for every new computer, do they

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:16.852
can just connect their drive and everything will be ready.

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:22.732
Here’s also free food, lots of interesting stuff, like nuts, seeds,

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:30.485
chocolates which you can eat. If it’s finished,

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.091
so here’s even more of them.

00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:37.240
Usually here is Valve’s cafeteria, where everybody

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.533
has a meal, but now it serves as playing zone. There’s a large

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:50.047
stream, you can see our pizza for lunch,

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:46.732
Here’s a small press zone and we can see here.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:59.683
-“Hi!”  And here’s the room for media and managers. Manager

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:06.112
s can’t enter the rooms where players are working, so players are

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.048
doing their stuff without them. 
Manager stream room. Here are all of them. 
This is Zhou which has won the game. 

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:19.719
Here’ you can see lots of interesting

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:41.444
things, including prizes Aegis and the 2nd one with a cool figure Axe. In

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:54.819
addition here’s such a courier. 

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:12.016
