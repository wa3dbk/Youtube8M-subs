00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.139
 yes hello and welcome to the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.990
 fair in friedrichshafen on the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.860
 eurobike where we give you the news 2014 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.630
 want to introduce 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.310
 At the booth of sram I not only have 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.420
 found great products but also 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.090
 an old known one 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.539
 thorsten wilhelm did a good job 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.160
 beautiful and thorsten will me the whole 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.239
 explain the news that exists now 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.400
 at the new sandforce i saw 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.080
 the brake has virtually unchanged the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.940
 Of course, I already know them at the 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.449
 Thorsten attacks there are some 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.820
 changes 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.059
 this time going on exactly so first time 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.000
 more is our new force forced to 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.129
 we now go to 11 8 special feature 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.890
 The ship is completely new 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.170
 shifter you have a pleasant feeling 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.570
 It was a bigger bank where you stop 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.460
 You really can not slip over 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.530
 can now what we already at all 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.059
 Groups of us were the founder and 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.490
 get closer to the brake lever 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.530
 but this time with a bus where it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.630
 really fine tuned nicely after 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.000
 front comes where it stops for girls 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.580
 or just for guys like me with little ones 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 short fingers better on the donors 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.000
 the brake come that is the special 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.250
 the ergonomics are here 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.040
 so decisive the visually the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.970
 almost like the red shift 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.230
 we already all know the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.320
 professional area is already used 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.390
 It is almost like world but it is said 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.070
 then it is almost exactly like the red 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 it is a bit heavier 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.820
 there are just no titanium screws in it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.230
 but otherwise it's really like that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.150
 red we have here too we call that 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.050
 zero going that means we move the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.720
 ship 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.540
 Never and the cable would have direct train 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.640
 the switching train has direct voltage and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 have a direct motion also behind 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.390
 on the trailer so immediately in action 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.070
 yes is great then must be addressed 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.930
 the raider sayings rear derailleur 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.540
 that we have here in the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.900
 So execution Reifler the there's also 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.570
 again in long with up to 32 chains 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.380
 wrestling behind and the big feature 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.910
 very big news here demand 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.200
 throwers you can also with the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.770
 explain because there is already a lot 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.830
 technology in it 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.360
 we call that your technology is coming 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.600
 probably from the sport of sailing 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.790
 the special here is that you if you are 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.440
 Switch on the front of a large sheet 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 or not on the small plate anymore 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 readjust but he only switches 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.330
 once and during the switching process connects 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
 itself or or turns the derailleur 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.570
 slightly oblique that is he goes 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.720
 actually this movement of 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.490
 pendulum movement minimum rotation during 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.380
 the election process outwards so that the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.730
 chain after that never never writes 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.440
 so big you can drive small small 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.150
 were made into a position for the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.670
 werder and that at 11 8 behind 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.250
 you never would have grind on 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.930
 derailleurs it runs quite clean and you 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.170
 you switch over quickly because we are 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 have also again tuned in 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.190
 we also have rear derailleur 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.290
 ceramic ball bearings in there that is the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.470
 circuit is insanely quiet is one 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 completely new switchgear and also front 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.380
 from the chain leaves 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.740
 let's take the ixs headed comes out 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.780
 the mountain bike technology where we what 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.850
 new is not completely carbon 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.650
 but only the curves of the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.840
 carbon and that's just another 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.660
 work more stable then easier 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.950
 with an aluminum spyder and have the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.570
 special feature that we with the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.270
 chaining here the switching process 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.520
 You can see it too much stiffer 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.740
 the chainring so what more stability 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.330
 and have specified the switching process 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.310
 that means with the medallion technology 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.860
 that you really only have to and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.200
 downshift must hit the chain 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.450
 immediately on the right pinion and what 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.060
 the extremely fast switching process 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.800
 For me it is one in itself 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.540
 optimized unit that is the one of 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.450
 now maybe an old scrape 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.100
 Compact Google has been there though 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.870
 possible only the thrower and maybe 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.340
 but ideally to take 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.620
 one equips completely 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.720
 because it's just perfect 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.460
 works perfectly so it is 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.380
 tuned so you could the 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.390
 Mile in the left of the switchgear 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.270
 you could take but everything up front 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.680
 is with chain derailleur and just the same 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.110
 chaining is for each other 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.940
 for both of us agreed that is at 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.930
 the dome quickly back up because 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.000
 we can switch faster 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.040
 of course, there is the same 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.480
 in compact so with 50 34 10 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.450
 basically also important in 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.600
 the thrower integrated catcher so 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.160
 this little particle something screwed 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.380
 is screwed on very well too 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.450
 that it just explained here with only one 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.510
 do not screw the chain with it 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.880
 next falls and very important in the 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.820
 wavelight just for the more hobbymäßig 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.889
 on the go are big puzzles in 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.080
 which gradings are the 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.689
 are the ones to have at the big one 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.789
 it is good from 11 to 32 puzzles 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.639
 tuned that you are a really good one 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.729
 but you can also switch 12 to 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.949
 So if you do not want a cock , there is 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.900
 even from 12 high out there there are all 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.689
 all possibilities you can also with 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.999
 one with a big cage so with 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.340
 our live live system also 928 he 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:19.860
 driving sick is also great but you 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.580
 can be around 32 only with a long one 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.620
 kate then you have to stop it differently 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.710
 while he was so for the mountain tours yes 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.879
 like former sprinters have stopped 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.129
 not so high up a mountain 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.139
 That's why the 32 seats are certainly closed 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.819
 recommend as well as the expertises of 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.550
 thorsten every year, thank you 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.270
 and, of course , the tram force trend 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.270
 Thank you
