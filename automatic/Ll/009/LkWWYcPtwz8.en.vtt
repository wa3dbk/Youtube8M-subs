00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.730
 you read a lot of sulfur 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.700
 plus hear this server is not pvp like 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.390
 no cork and immediately available pvp 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.410
 but here it is 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.399
 as always we have beautiful spawn beautiful 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:45.340

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:08.560
 work why did they put this man 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.369
 they are even less effective than you 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.369
 going to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 remember that the players just killed him 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.000
 that cop abide 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.509
 kills so on it's awful 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.509
 a more eternal kingdom comes 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:41.229
 we have a plate type 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
 seat type 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.790
 so link the plugin will perform 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.910

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.530
 plug lut and this head 30 tenants 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.150
 happen 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.789
 hard shock 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:15.900
 First, not all boards are used not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.659
 ruffak 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.730
 and visible 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.590
 no it didn't work out make them their bodies 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.900
 shooting boats they now put here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.739
 nameplates 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.739
 Trusevich incomprehensible 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:59.510
 breen portal appeared which they 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:03.680
 destroyed okay let's write kids 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 tarkett stark here is basically normal 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.129
 Kyivstar but he meant like you're not 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.859
 tell the Christmas trees exchange and do not say, and they 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:18.049
 do not call it that he is not on you 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:20.019
 remember from spawn and then all sorts of nuances 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.900
 there is no sense 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.450
 for some reason enchantment instead of them 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.639
 very fit if by architecture 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.959
 I would be Russified for this hour 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:40.219
 one of the horns we do not understand what is visible 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.730
 turnout in which we calm down the portal 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.730
 shop 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:55.260
 as always it is a maze and we have arranged 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:59.520
 again in these notches why are they why 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:07.370
 stupid grooves they damn well add decor 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.370
 but also uncomfortable redstone where 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.300
 drawing 1 to 70 seems to me too much 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.520
 can ok well as 8 as always 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.340
 write in the comments under the video or one 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:28.370
 py server is not so blogs 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.370
 Ares cargo at least I do not see food 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:36.470
 sublime and scores were fried fish 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.470
 bent 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:47.170
 yes cheap table autumn if here 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.100
 Jobs something very cheap all over 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.330
 nothing to wear this 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:59.280
 and so you happen we go over here 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.280
 here you are some strange place 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.890
 appeared in hell for whose 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:10.150
 puzzles why are there trees here and what are you 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.510
 beautiful here is not even taken 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.510
 got it 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.670
 but here at least to develop but do not know 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.290
 why such a portal 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:31.120
 here i am on myself whether start damn actually i 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:35.200
 I do not really like such servers in which 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.160
 make everything easy right away at least 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.210
 this server plus is a restart and one more time 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:47.220
 Igor and on this perhaps I finish 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:51.160
 I at the end of the movie say it 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.940
 personally my opinion every person can 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.960
 my opinion and other people should not 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.250
 succumb if they want this opinion 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.760
 just already forgot exactly something but still i 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.510
 I told you that this is only my opinion and 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:17.880
 insert you give in to him as always 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:17.880
 Well, with you there was silentip and all for now
