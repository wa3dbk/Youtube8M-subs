00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 for me 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.440
 in the video this week we're going to do 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.500
 a garland of pennants like this 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.680
 it has 13 different pennants 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.950
 Fabric colors are achieved both 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.810
 ahead as well as behind the part of 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.570
 up are subject to each other by a 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.650
 well and between each one we have left a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.650
 inch of difference 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.230
 to the extremes we have left a good 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.870
 piece of good and will hold a rope 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 that allows us to give our best in both 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.440
 extreme as in the other and nothing is very 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.880
 easy we can make it as long as 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.690
 we want to add more or less 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.129
 pennants is in particular has 13 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 and in a moment we can have it 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.430
 prepared if you like and you are interested 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 know it 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.800
 we will need pieces of cloth cut in 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.290
 triangle with the shape of the lid 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.270
 for every piece that remains put life 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.270
 we will need two pieces of tiles 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.000
 x 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 for cats triangle 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.040
 the same fabric tone 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.040
 rope 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.180
 10 tape 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.299
 that has the measure would have the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.729
 garland a little longer and some 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.320
 scissors of these that has the edge of 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.110
 pizza and cut out the fabrics from 9 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.190
 Francisca 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.410
 the materials 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.420
 we're going to be doing the biznaga and what 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.430
 what we have to do is face the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.190
 back with the back of 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.590
 the triangles that will form that go 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.440
 to form the garland in this case reverse 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.080
 of the cloth 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.080
 we face with the reverse of the other fabric 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.770
 we hold with some pins 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.450
 and we go to the sewing machine 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.270
 and we have to sew this side 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.430
 and this side 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.740
 we can spend all of the wine we start 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.800
 here we finish we arrived here turn and 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.319
 we continue or stitch here until the end and 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.659
 then it will be here until the end 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.549
 so this we have to do with 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.650
 each of the fabric that will 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.450
 form the line if we want it to have 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.340
 ten more line after pennants 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.340
 so let's put them 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.730
 and we already have and in all the pennants 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.859
 in a seam with the backs 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.230
 faced the two longest parties 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.700
 of the triangle the top is 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.600
 necessary to own the then we have 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.780
 left open 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.330
 and now we're going to continue counting on 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.350
 the scissors are these that have the edge of 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.380
 chalk and that when you cut that leaves it in chalk 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.970
 all over the three of the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.130
 pennants the part that in the parts 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.460
 that we have gone we cut them with scissors 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.460
 chalks 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.120
 that's how it's going to stay like that in a triangle 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.470
 to help the fabric does not take off and 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.720
 that is still 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.040
 and a nicer finish to make the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.200
 pennant 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 so I cut to slide all the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.439
 edges of all the flags and when 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.439
 we have it we started to assemble it 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.629
 cut the sewn zig zag edges 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.610
 we have as many as 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.940
 we want it to be the length of the 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.400
 sleeve 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.310
 and now what we are going to do is with the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.310
 pyramid we have a class 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.930
 We can plant the plant in half this 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.990
 will facilitate the work we iron 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.240
 all half 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.020
 and what I'm going to do is add some 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.030
 pieces of rope 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.240
 at the ends of the 10 that are going to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.360
 allow to hang it from blocks of 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.259
 where I decide to put them then nothing 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.259
 in Little pieces 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.970
 such a thing 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.910
 and what I 'm going to do the end of 10 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.190
 I'm going to fold it a bit like that 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.440
 in and then in the middle 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.800
 and here in this half I'm going to put the 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.800
 ropes 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:11.899
 a little bit and I'm going to put this part 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.569
 He topped forward and backward and 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:17.919
 then I start to conserve everything 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.919
 it would be fine and then and closing 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.709
 then I will leave as a space 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.019
 of about two three four five six seven 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:29.339
 inches and in the seventh inch I'm going to 

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:29.339
 start putting the pennants 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.510
 I put it here 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:41.720
 aligned with the center of 10 and over here 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.430
 we can not hold with a pin and for 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.680
 here is where we are going to go sewing 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.370
 when we reach the end we have as 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.199
 firm 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.860
 the next pennant we put it to 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.860
 continuation 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.410
 it projects us then and we continue 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.150
 sewing or we can leave a space of 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.310
 the pennants I'm going to leave between 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.350
 pennant and pennant the space of a 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.080
 inch I like more how it looks 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.190
 so I'm riding pennants 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 well you are having until we get there 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.630
 at the end and when we get to the end 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.250
 we leave again a space of 7 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.230
 inches from the last for the interim 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.180
 and we go back to sew in the way that you 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.370
 said other pieces of string 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.060
 so let's go to the machine and go 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.060
 counting the garland 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.500
 and we have sewn all the garland 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.300
 At the beginning we have left a piece of 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.979
 good about 7 inches without sewing 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.960
 At the beginning we added a piece of 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.330
 rope to be able to tie it well and what 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.280
 I was telling you at the beginning that we have to 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.470
 Bend 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.290
 the good is inward we sew here a 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.040
 little bit and then we're taking everything 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.040
 along the well 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.710
 the flags when the 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:05.689
 we are introducing in the good we are going 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.429
 catching 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.409
 and between each pennant and pennant 

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:11.650
 we have left an inch of 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:15.300
 separation 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.300
 all all all 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.849
 and nothing is to get to the end 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:22.849
 we repeat the process 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.670
 7 inches apart 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.800
 we have caught the 10 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.800
 here a little so that the rope is 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:39.860
 well attached and nothing will have ready the 

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:42.169
 garland to decorate a room 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.409
 for a party for you all that 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.409
 we want
