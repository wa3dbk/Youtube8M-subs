00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
out and I they already made the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
out and I they already made the
announcement<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.120> PTR<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:49.110> down

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
announcement the PTR is going down

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.880 
announcement the PTR is going down
tomorrow<00:00:50.390> January<00:00:51.390> night<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.649> going

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
tomorrow January night so that's going

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
tomorrow January night so that's going
to<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.100> ahead<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.550> down<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.940> PTR<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.600> be

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to go ahead and go down the PTR will be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.950 
to go ahead and go down the PTR will be
closed<00:00:55.129> now<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.430> imagine<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:57.780> an

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
closed now I imagine that if there's an

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
closed now I imagine that if there's an
announcement<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> maintenance<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
announcement for the maintenance that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
announcement for the maintenance that
it's<00:00:59.910> probably<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.620> panch

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's probably going to be for the panch

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's probably going to be for the panch
coming<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.690> all<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:03.989> forward<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
coming so we can all look forward to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
coming so we can all look forward to
that<00:01:04.860> next<00:01:05.100> Tuesday<00:01:05.700> I've<00:01:06.390> been<00:01:06.570> farming<00:01:06.990> up

that next Tuesday I've been farming up
quite<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.710> testing<00:01:08.520> quite<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
quite a bit testing quite a bit on the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.130 
quite a bit testing quite a bit on the
PTR<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.619> we've<00:01:11.340> done<00:01:12.090> our<00:01:12.119> research<00:01:12.270> we've<00:01:12.900> got

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
PTR so we've done our research we've got

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
PTR so we've done our research we've got
everything<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> place<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.909> guys<00:01:15.119> are

still around because I know that this is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
still around because I know that this is
a<00:01:17.220> pretty<00:01:17.490> slow<00:01:17.759> time<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> diablo

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
a pretty slow time for the diablo

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
a pretty slow time for the diablo
community<00:01:19.320> especially<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> PTR<00:01:20.400> going

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
community especially with the PTR going
