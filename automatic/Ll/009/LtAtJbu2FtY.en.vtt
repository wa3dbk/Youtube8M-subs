started clapping how about instead of

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.220 
started clapping how about instead of
giving<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.880> number<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.600> stars<00:03:33.870> let's<00:03:34.079> give<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
giving it number of stars let's give it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.780 
giving it number of stars let's give it
a<00:03:34.320> percentage<00:03:34.829> like<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.640> rate

a percentage like if I was just to rate
the<00:03:35.910> first<00:03:36.090> half<00:03:36.299> I'd<00:03:36.540> probably<00:03:36.690> give<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:36.959> like

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
the first half I'd probably give it like

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.610 
the first half I'd probably give it like
75<00:03:37.860> seventy-eight<00:03:38.549> percent<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:39.510> overall<00:03:39.810> the

whole movie I probably give it I don't
know<00:03:42.660> maybe<00:03:42.780> sixty<00:03:43.290> five<00:03:43.500> percent<00:03:43.950> at<00:03:44.160> most<00:03:46.220> mm
