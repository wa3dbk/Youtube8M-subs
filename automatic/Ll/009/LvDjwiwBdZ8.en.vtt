another<00:05:10.250> machine<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:11.210> stresses<00:05:11.660> each<00:05:12.050> test

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
another machine that stresses each test

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.870 
another machine that stresses each test
season<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.400> finally<00:05:13.970> fair<00:05:15.639> so<00:05:16.639> here

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
season so it's finally fair so here

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.570 
season so it's finally fair so here
we're<00:05:17.150> seeing<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.690> actual<00:05:18.110> trace<00:05:18.710> for<00:05:19.490> the

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
we're seeing the actual trace for the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.700 
we're seeing the actual trace for the
force<00:05:19.910> things<00:05:20.300> submitted<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.139> the<00:05:21.229> material

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
force things submitted to the material

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.350 
force things submitted to the material
in<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.950> machine<00:05:22.280> in<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.849> event<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.210> an

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
in the machine in the event of an

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.779 
in the machine in the event of an
accident<00:05:23.539> rider<00:05:24.500> coming<00:05:24.620> off<00:05:24.979> a<00:05:25.010> motorcycle

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
accident rider coming off a motorcycle

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.650 
accident rider coming off a motorcycle
and<00:05:25.940> a<00:05:26.510> very<00:05:26.870> sudden<00:05:27.460> large<00:05:28.460> force<00:05:29.000> is<00:05:29.330> often

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
and a very sudden large force is often

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.810 
and a very sudden large force is often
subjected<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.620> scene

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.610 

on<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.060> monitor<00:05:35.420> here<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.780> can<00:05:35.990> see<00:05:36.230> the

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
on the monitor here you can see the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.340 
on the monitor here you can see the
force<00:05:36.920> read<00:05:37.550> out<00:05:37.730> that<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.360> seam<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:39.260> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
force read out that the seam and the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.040 
force read out that the seam and the
material<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.920> being<00:05:40.220> subjected<00:05:41.000> to<00:05:41.180> the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
material is being subjected to the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.900 
material is being subjected to the
thousand<00:05:42.590> Newton's<00:05:42.920> on<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:43.280> scale<00:05:43.580> here

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
thousand Newton's on the scale here

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.810 
thousand Newton's on the scale here
equates<00:05:44.570> roughly<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.260> 500<00:05:45.860> pounds<00:05:46.010> of<00:05:46.280> force

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
equates roughly to 500 pounds of force

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.000 
equates roughly to 500 pounds of force
so<00:05:47.330> we're<00:05:47.480> looking<00:05:47.600> for<00:05:47.960> that<00:05:48.110> as<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.620> minimum

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
so we're looking for that as the minimum

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.820 
so we're looking for that as the minimum
standard<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:49.610> we<00:05:49.760> require<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.810> here<00:05:51.350> in<00:05:51.680> this

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
standard that we require so here in this

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.160 
standard that we require so here in this
case<00:05:52.220> this<00:05:52.460> sample<00:05:52.970> broke<00:05:53.180> above<00:05:53.660> that<00:05:53.870> so

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
case this sample broke above that so

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.690 
case this sample broke above that so
we've<00:05:54.350> exceeded<00:05:54.770> our<00:05:55.070> own<00:05:55.280> in-house
