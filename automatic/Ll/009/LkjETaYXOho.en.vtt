00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 

now<00:01:00.210> let's<00:01:00.360> see<00:01:00.540> if<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.899> take<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.370> camera<00:01:02.420> pick

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
now let's see if I take the camera pick

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
now let's see if I take the camera pick
it<00:01:03.540> up

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it up

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.170 
it up
see

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
see

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.660 
see
that's<00:01:07.630> got<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> bubble<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.410> it

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
that's got a bubble in it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's got a bubble in it
why<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:10.330> kind<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.540> reflecting<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.200> from<00:01:11.350> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
why it's kind of reflecting it from the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.100 
why it's kind of reflecting it from the
outside<00:01:11.830> but

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
outside but

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.760 
outside but
it<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:14.390> fully<00:01:15.390> functional<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.080> accurate<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it is fully functional very accurate I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.340 
it is fully functional very accurate I
actually<00:01:17.010> use<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:17.760> my<00:01:17.880> job<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
actually use this on my job and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.060 
actually use this on my job and the
satellite<00:01:19.860> biz<00:01:24.620> bounced<00:01:25.620> around<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:26.010> little

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
satellite biz bounced around a little

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.250 
satellite biz bounced around a little
bit<00:01:26.250> okay<00:01:28.820> very<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.000> accurate<00:01:30.450> has<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> number

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
bit okay very very accurate has a number

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.690 
bit okay very very accurate has a number
of<00:01:31.290> different<00:01:31.590> features<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> has<00:01:32.670> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
of different features on it has a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
of different features on it has a
rotating<00:01:33.180> mark<00:01:33.990> ring<00:01:34.260> so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.620> can<00:01:34.860> set

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
rotating mark ring so you can set

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.570 
rotating mark ring so you can set
bearings<00:01:36.020> if<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.710> navigation<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
bearings if using it for navigation and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.460 
bearings if using it for navigation and
inside<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> course<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:41.010> very<00:01:41.640> dirty<00:01:41.970> but

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
inside of course is a very dirty but

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.760 
inside of course is a very dirty but
very<00:01:43.640> very<00:01:45.560> good<00:01:47.240> signaling<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.770> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
very very good signaling there and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
very very good signaling there and
there's<00:01:50.160> little<00:01:50.310> marks<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> side<00:01:51.210> here

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
there's little marks on the side here

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.469 
there's little marks on the side here
for<00:01:52.310> making<00:01:53.310> sure<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
for making sure you get it back in and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
for making sure you get it back in and
it<00:01:54.630> locks<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:55.050> securely<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.070> in

it locks very securely and that's in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.060 
it locks very securely and that's in
