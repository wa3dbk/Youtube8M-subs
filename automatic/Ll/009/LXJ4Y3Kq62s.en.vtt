00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you're trying to promote and when I was

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.149 
you're trying to promote and when I was
thinking<00:02:00.450> about<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.320> had<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
thinking about this I had to think of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.160 
thinking about this I had to think of
the<00:02:02.189> movie<00:02:02.610> Inception<00:02:02.969> most<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.049> have

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the movie Inception most of you have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.959 
the movie Inception most of you have
probably<00:02:04.200> seen<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.100> movie<00:02:05.369> Inception<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
probably seen the movie Inception and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.270 
probably seen the movie Inception and
you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> moment<00:02:07.649> where<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> main

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you know that moment where the main

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.630 
you know that moment where the main
character<00:02:08.819> implants

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
character implants

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.630 
character implants
into<00:02:10.149> his<00:02:10.270> wife's<00:02:10.509> mind<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.370> idea

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
into his wife's mind and that this idea

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760 
into his wife's mind and that this idea
becomes<00:02:13.240> her<00:02:13.540> reality<00:02:14.110> which<00:02:14.319> makes<00:02:14.590> her

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
becomes her reality which makes her

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.670 
becomes her reality which makes her
somewhat<00:02:15.220> crazy<00:02:15.430> well<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> exactly<00:02:17.410> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
somewhat crazy well this is exactly the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
somewhat crazy well this is exactly the
same<00:02:17.890> thing<00:02:18.130> implants<00:02:18.850> an<00:02:18.940> ID<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.630> spread

such and I applaud those who do probably
more<00:02:56.590> than<00:02:56.739> half<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.130> good<00:02:57.340> intentions<00:02:57.940> but

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
more than half of good intentions but

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.479 
more than half of good intentions but
it's<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.900> other<00:02:59.050> bad<00:02:59.380> half<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.890> gets<00:03:00.160> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
it's the other bad half that gets the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.259 
it's the other bad half that gets the
most<00:03:00.640> reaction<00:03:01.420> by<00:03:01.989> what<00:03:02.410> they<00:03:02.560> write<00:03:02.830> and

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
most reaction by what they write and

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.390 
most reaction by what they write and
probably<00:03:04.269> by<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.050> use<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.260> all<00:03:05.680> caps<00:03:06.010> as<00:03:06.250> well

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
probably by the use of all caps as well
