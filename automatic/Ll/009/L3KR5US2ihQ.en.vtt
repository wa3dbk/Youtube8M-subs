00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.490
 [Music] 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.240
 when this other video also shows 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 not only when the train hits the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.860
 collective but also how much when it gives 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 against the other train that comes from front 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.539
 is a security camera in the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.680
 station that shows the arrival to this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.789
 train the collective 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.619
 [Music] 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.099
 and how they collide after two trains of 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.099
 front 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.180
 and that shows that the impact was also 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.070
 strong among the 22 trains declared as 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.260
 these afternoons these good afternoon I 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.070
 I was seeing the faces well in clear 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.370
 that the collective does not take the train almost 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.820
 in the middle or I already had a good part 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.409
 of the roads this had happened 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.479
 a lot of the ways I want to say yes 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:01.700
 because in the image that was known yesterday 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:05.120
 passengers wherever 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.030
 and yes, there are people who are 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.130
 leaving other auxiliary here can not 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.520
 leave the windows so easily 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.070
 I did not want to say yesterday the image that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.620
 spread throughout the day it was the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.670
 impression that the impact occurs 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.130
 this image of this image also of 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.290
 a security camera of the station 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.510
 in sample because the machinists were 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.080
 beaten we are of natural punch 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.900
 strong clear it looked yesterday then 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.290
 it seemed rather that it was only the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 trunk of the collective in which there was 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.520
 past and just that part is what 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.310
 the train runs over but here we see 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.350
 clarity that almost hits them and let's see 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.910
 almost half of the collective is almost the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.830
 half had already passed the 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.780
 collective and there we see the shock of 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.390
 in front of the two trains 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.610
 thank goodness that one was with very little 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.530
 tav speed just coming out and when 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.410
 the other was decreasing his 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.670
 because it came and then what we just 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.010
 to see newly desperate people 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.450
 coming out as they could from the train gives the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.770
 feeling that the collective is left with 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020
 this image that the barrier was 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.850
 low because the train was stopped at 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.470
 station and do not look for the other side 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.280
 for the right they are impressed to their 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.819
 right gives the impression that 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.610
 It was 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.930
 but we keep another image 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.930
 others in the image you will see 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 all these images have the judge 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.670
 ercolini who understands in this case was 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.670
 federal 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.160
 and good 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.290
 there we see again the impact on singing 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.620
 first with the collective and then between 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 the three 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.430
 life here another different image d 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.630
 each jump of the cameras placed in 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.400
 the station is very well is not 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.560
 stopped the train is arriving is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 arriving if it's really coming not 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.010
 We did not get any of the trains 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 stopped 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.260
 [Music] 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.330
 and it has some speed and there it looks 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.370
 how it turns on it goes back 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.240
 how people run because they do not know what 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.580
 It will happen 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.800
 I heard the impact are distracted not 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.960
 pay attention first see that a train 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.530
 comes normally and there they feel the 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.750
 terrible impact Ricardo one looks at the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:34.170
 images and becomes even more aware of what 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 that has passed a lucky series of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.410
 unpredictability and imprudence that 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.950
 end with this unfortunate result 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.270
 so many dead and so much would it slow down the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.860
 collective does not grab nearly half 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.870
 up space space mass but not 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 he wants not brakes exact passes slowly 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.530
 but this brakes is possible as I said 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.390
 well what happens what good here 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.770
 driver of the collective is dead that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.209
 is looking for the other side but of 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.070
 every way you are looking for pulled there 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.260
 what to see and the train is an alternative 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.150
 for the season and that he believes that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.740
 train will be stopped there that what 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.600
 grab almost in half I exist with this 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.520
 because the image of yesterday that the only one of 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.170
 yesterday you could not appreciate 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.180
 where was the place but also now 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.829
 thinking that the train that comes in 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.170
 movement and that will pay in the 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.329
 station gave the bus driver 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.910
 he speculated that insurance was being prepared and 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.060
 if it did not stop good because it crosses the same 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.580
 [Music] 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:37.390
 also this other image here in the other 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.540
 train can see also clearly is 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.210
 as the train intersects with the impact to 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.600
 the other track and that is where occurs the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:52.530
 23 of your own and you are going to contract another 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.530
 3 there is not a person and in the 10 below 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.560
 Well I think one to despair 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.560
 you do not know what can happen
