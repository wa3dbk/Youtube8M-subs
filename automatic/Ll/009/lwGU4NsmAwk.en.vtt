00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
different from their main game so I like

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
missions that I'll go back through them

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
missions that I'll go back through them
with<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.829> less<00:00:56.129> experienced<00:00:56.640> scored

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.730 

okay<00:01:04.480> i<00:01:04.510> don't<00:01:04.930> think<00:01:05.199> these<00:01:05.470> guys<00:01:05.530> have

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
okay i don't think these guys have

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.640 
okay i don't think these guys have
suppresses<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:06.820> it's<00:01:07.030> gonna<00:01:07.630> be<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.840> bit<00:01:08.110> harder

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
suppresses so it's gonna be a bit harder

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.530 
suppresses so it's gonna be a bit harder
to<00:01:08.680> do<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.190> but<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.760> think<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.120> don't<00:01:10.360> think

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
to do this but I think I don't think

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.720 
to do this but I think I don't think
I've<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:11.050> don't<00:01:11.410> think<00:01:11.890> any<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.190> them<00:01:12.370> are<00:01:12.490> like

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
I've I don't think any of them are like

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I've I don't think any of them are like
specialist<00:01:13.390> weapons<00:01:13.750> either<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.510> ship

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
specialist weapons either so it is ship

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:32.480 
specialist weapons either so it is ship
we<00:01:17.230> should<00:01:17.410> okay

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.620 

so<00:01:33.490> one<00:01:33.640> thing<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:33.910> really<00:01:34.060> like<00:01:34.330> about<00:01:34.360> this

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
so one thing I really like about this

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.110 
so one thing I really like about this
game<00:01:34.870> is<00:01:34.900> that<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.530> can<00:01:36.340> set<00:01:36.910> like<00:01:37.090> a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
game is that you can set like a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.960 
game is that you can set like a
destination<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.740> can<00:01:38.920> redirect<00:01:39.280> points

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
destination and you can redirect points

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.040 
destination and you can redirect points
on<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:41.460> unit's<00:01:42.460> path<00:01:42.760> or<00:01:43.060> whatever<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.960> you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
on the unit's path or whatever so you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.070 
on the unit's path or whatever so you
let<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.290> phone<00:01:47.500> again<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:48.070> head<00:01:48.220> over<00:01:48.460> here<00:01:48.729> I

let the phone again to head over here I

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.200 
let the phone again to head over here I
can<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.229> that<00:01:50.380> but<00:01:51.280> say<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:51.610> want<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.880> hand<00:01:52.060> her

usually I'm fairly good at it but that

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.000 
usually I'm fairly good at it but that
was<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> bit<00:02:33.450> bad<00:02:33.659> because<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.379> just<00:02:34.439> lost<00:02:34.739> two

was a bit bad because I just lost two

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.759 
was a bit bad because I just lost two
soldiers<00:02:35.359> in<00:02:36.359> one<00:02:36.719> phase<00:02:36.989> from<00:02:37.889> there<00:02:39.769> they

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
soldiers in one phase from there they

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.050 
soldiers in one phase from there they
look<00:02:41.099> more<00:02:41.510> conservatively

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.190 

I'm<00:02:49.060> not<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.569> use<00:02:49.660> any<00:02:49.810> different

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
I'm not going to use any different

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.050 
I'm not going to use any different
places<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.830> don't<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.459> do<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:51.910> some

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
places I don't like to do that for some

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.440 
places I don't like to do that for some
reason<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.390> feel<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:52.810> cheating<00:02:54.330> get<00:02:55.330> my

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
reason I feel like it's cheating get my

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.270 
reason I feel like it's cheating get my
FPS<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.050> dropping<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.590> can't<00:02:56.830> really<00:02:57.010> work

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.479 
that's actually worried because I just
going<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:14.410> add<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.709> four<00:03:15.310> yes<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:17.319> I'll<00:03:17.920> get

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
going to add like four yes so I'll get

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.500 
going to add like four yes so I'll get
this<00:03:18.670> finished

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.320 

just<00:03:24.720> quickly<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.470> cans<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.069> think<00:03:26.330> that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
just quickly as I cans and I think that

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.759 
just quickly as I cans and I think that
bad<00:03:27.510> enough<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:29.599> can't<00:03:30.599> tell<00:03:30.810> if<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.019> fixed

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
bad enough I can't tell if it's fixed

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:40.930 
bad enough I can't tell if it's fixed
yeah

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.790 

one<00:03:41.690> thing<00:03:41.840> I'm<00:03:41.930> not<00:03:42.110> sure<00:03:42.290> about<00:03:42.410> in<00:03:42.650> this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
one thing I'm not sure about in this

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.820 
one thing I'm not sure about in this
getting<00:03:43.220> as<00:03:43.850> if<00:03:44.030> once<00:03:44.300> they<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:45.170> seeing<00:03:45.680> you

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
getting as if once they like seeing you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.160 
getting as if once they like seeing you
once<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:46.700> then<00:03:46.940> move<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:47.930> don't

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
once if you then move and they don't

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.930 
once if you then move and they don't
spot<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.680> whether<00:03:48.920> or<00:03:49.070> not<00:03:49.280> they<00:03:49.460> still<00:03:49.760> know

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
spot you whether or not they still know

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.470 
spot you whether or not they still know
where<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.240> are<00:03:51.610> it's<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.760> bit<00:03:52.910> like<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.240> know
