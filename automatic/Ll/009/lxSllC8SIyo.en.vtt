00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and he sees the nexus go down so he's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230

nothing here even with perfect micro

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.120 
nothing here even with perfect micro

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
coming in first she's canceling the gas

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.810 
coming in first she's canceling the gas
Siri<00:02:14.380> tries<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:15.100> around<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> zoo

Siri tries to get around but the zoo

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.530 
Siri tries to get around but the zoo
things<00:02:16.180> up<00:02:16.360> better<00:02:16.660> oh<00:02:17.050> man<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.160> probes

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
things up better oh man the probes

things up better oh man the probes
losing<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.630> fight<00:02:19.690> pretty<00:02:20.140> badly<00:02:20.410> here<00:02:20.800> I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
losing this fight pretty badly here I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.410 
losing this fight pretty badly here I
have<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.130> say<00:02:21.340> yeah<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.240> be

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
have to say yeah this is gonna be

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210 
have to say yeah this is gonna be
absolutely<00:02:22.570> horrible<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.440> potting<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.890> guys

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
absolutely horrible for potting you guys

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
absolutely horrible for potting you guys
got<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> decent<00:02:24.700> trade<00:02:25.210> off<00:02:25.360> because<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
got a decent trade off because the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
got a decent trade off because the
drones<00:02:25.990> aren't<00:02:26.170> open<00:02:26.500> position<00:02:26.800> but

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
drones aren't open position but

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
drones aren't open position but
everything<00:02:27.190> else<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.340> gonna<00:02:27.460> get<00:02:27.640> cleaned<00:02:27.820> up

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
everything else is gonna get cleaned up

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
everything else is gonna get cleaned up
and<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.210> think<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.570> might<00:02:28.750> actually<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.200> game

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
and I think you might actually see game

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.170 
and I think you might actually see game
you're<00:02:30.190> gonna<00:02:30.280> try<00:02:30.490> going<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:30.880> pilot

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you're gonna try going for that pilot

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.610 
you're gonna try going for that pilot
for<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> delicates<00:02:31.930> out<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.350> should<00:02:32.530> be

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
for the delicates out but it should be

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.290 
for the delicates out but it should be
out<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.890> time<00:02:33.160> gonna<00:02:33.820> make<00:02:33.970> things<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.210> little

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
out in time gonna make things a little

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.750 
out in time gonna make things a little
bit<00:02:34.450> easier<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:35.440> our<00:02:35.530> potting<00:02:36.010> but<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.550> many

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
bit easier to our potting but so many

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730 
bit easier to our potting but so many
surgeons<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.420> main<00:02:37.630> base<00:02:37.840> yeah<00:02:38.230> zealot

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
surgeons in the main base yeah zealot

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.230 
surgeons in the main base yeah zealot
already<00:02:39.010> taken<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> lot<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.460> damage<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:40.060> he's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240

already taken a lot of damage here he's
trying<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> credibly<00:02:40.750> out<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.020> second<00:02:41.560> one<00:02:41.680> here

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
trying to credibly out a second one here

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.260 
trying to credibly out a second one here
maybe<00:02:42.100> if<00:02:42.250> he<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.460> get<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.640> second<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.150> out

maybe if he can get that second one out

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.970 
maybe if he can get that second one out
he<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.870> good<00:02:44.080> but<00:02:44.140> he<00:02:44.320> has<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.680> keep<00:02:44.800> this
