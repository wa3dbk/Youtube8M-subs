00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.270 
skin tones I think this is something
that<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.110> should<00:02:03.140> definitely<00:02:03.470> add<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.159> your

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
that you should definitely add to your

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.910 
that you should definitely add to your
collection<00:02:04.399> she's<00:02:05.119> nowhere<00:02:05.450> near<00:02:05.659> as<00:02:06.320> dark<00:02:06.710> as

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
collection she's nowhere near as dark as

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.729 
collection she's nowhere near as dark as
I<00:02:07.130> am<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:08.360> looks<00:02:08.539> great<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.840> her<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
I am and it looks great on her and it

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.440 
I am and it looks great on her and it
also<00:02:09.890> looks<00:02:10.190> great<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.580> these<00:02:10.759> look<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.300> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
also looks great on these look in the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.540 
also looks great on these look in the
description<00:02:11.600> box<00:02:12.230> below<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.890> will<00:02:13.069> put<00:02:13.310> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
description box below I will put a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.460 
description box below I will put a
discount<00:02:14.209> code<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.690> there<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.870> think<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.350> gives

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
discount code and there I think it gives

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.590 
discount code and there I think it gives
you<00:02:15.620> fifteen<00:02:16.040> percent<00:02:16.370> off<00:02:16.549> in<00:02:16.880> addition<00:02:17.239> to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
you fifteen percent off in addition to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.130 
you fifteen percent off in addition to
free<00:02:17.810> shipping<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.580> think<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.600> retails

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
free shipping so I think this retails

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.080 
free shipping so I think this retails
for<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.500> nineteen<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:22.190> twenty<00:02:22.220> dollars<00:02:22.819> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
for like nineteen or twenty dollars and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.009 
for like nineteen or twenty dollars and
i<00:02:23.150> ended<00:02:23.450> up<00:02:23.540> paying<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.380> 15<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.400> um

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
i ended up paying I think 15 for it um

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.350 
i ended up paying I think 15 for it um
but<00:02:27.019> i'll<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.470> whatever<00:02:27.910> discounts<00:02:28.910> as<00:02:29.030> i<00:02:29.209> can
