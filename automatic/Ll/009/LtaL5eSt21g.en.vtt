00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
new truck for about three weeks and I

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.160 
new truck for about three weeks and I
didn't<00:01:29.950> realize<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:31.270> was<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.630> bad<00:01:31.810> as<00:01:31.870> it

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
didn't realize that it was as bad as it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.310 
didn't realize that it was as bad as it
was<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:33.610> tire<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:34.120> actually<00:01:34.600> going<00:01:34.780> like<00:01:35.050> this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
was my tire was actually going like this

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.700 
was my tire was actually going like this
when<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.560> drove<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.900> because<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.380> don't<00:01:38.440> know

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
when I drove but because I don't know

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.930 
when I drove but because I don't know
excessive<00:01:39.100> speeds<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:41.320> anything<00:01:41.500> like<00:01:41.740> that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
excessive speeds or anything like that

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.300 
excessive speeds or anything like that
it<00:01:42.940> was<00:01:43.060> kind<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.300> hard<00:01:43.480> for<00:01:43.600> me<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.840> notice

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it was kind of hard for me to notice

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.680 
it was kind of hard for me to notice
especially<00:01:45.310> since<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.970> tire<00:01:46.210> was<00:01:46.480> still

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
especially since the tire was still

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.399 
especially since the tire was still
turning<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.290> circle<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.740> not<00:01:47.860> flat<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:49.409> went

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
turning in a circle and not flat I went

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.160 
turning in a circle and not flat I went
down<00:01:50.620> had<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.340> rim<00:01:51.490> checked<00:01:51.960> okay<00:01:52.960> that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
down had the rim checked okay that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.380 
down had the rim checked okay that
wasn't<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.500> problem<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.850> when<00:01:54.940> I<00:01:55.030> started

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
wasn't the problem so when I started

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.960 
wasn't the problem so when I started
reading<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:57.040> know<00:01:57.159> different<00:01:57.550> things<00:01:57.580> what

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
reading you know different things what

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.050 
reading you know different things what
key<00:01:58.150> causes<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.690> happen<00:01:59.080> wheel<00:01:59.770> bearings<00:02:00.310> took

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
key causes to happen wheel bearings took

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.289 
key causes to happen wheel bearings took
the<00:02:01.150> wheel<00:02:01.300> bearings<00:02:01.630> out<00:02:01.810> replaced<00:02:02.260> them

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the wheel bearings out replaced them

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.830 
the wheel bearings out replaced them
still<00:02:04.299> wobbly<00:02:04.870> so<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.680> said<00:02:06.220> well<00:02:06.840> maybe

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
still wobbly so I said well maybe

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.559 
still wobbly so I said well maybe
there's<00:02:08.080> something<00:02:08.259> wrong<00:02:08.470> with<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.799> axle<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
there's something wrong with the axle so

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.500 
there's something wrong with the axle so
I<00:02:10.599> took<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.019> axle<00:02:11.500> down<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> machine<00:02:13.269> shop

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
I took this axle down to a machine shop

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.309 
I took this axle down to a machine shop
and<00:02:15.870> yep<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:18.190> been<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.720> guy<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.110> bought

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
and yep it's been the guy that I bought

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.140 
and yep it's been the guy that I bought
the<00:02:20.470> truck<00:02:20.680> from<00:02:20.980> who<00:02:21.489> I'm<00:02:21.580> not<00:02:21.760> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> name

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the truck from who I'm not going to name

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.600 
the truck from who I'm not going to name
because<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.750> would<00:02:22.870> be<00:02:22.989> wrong<00:02:23.170> uh<00:02:23.530> he<00:02:24.340> didn't

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
because that would be wrong uh he didn't

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610 
because that would be wrong uh he didn't
tell<00:02:24.760> me<00:02:24.879> about<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.540> probably<00:02:25.959> wouldn't

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
tell me about this I probably wouldn't

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.530 
tell me about this I probably wouldn't
have<00:02:26.739> bought<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> truck<00:02:27.310> if<00:02:27.970> I'd<00:02:28.239> had<00:02:28.360> known

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
have bought the truck if I'd had known

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.570 
have bought the truck if I'd had known
because<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.349> been

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
because it's been

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.540 
because it's been
pain-in-the-butt<00:02:30.150> replacing<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.780> axle<00:02:31.550> not

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
pain-in-the-butt replacing this axle not
