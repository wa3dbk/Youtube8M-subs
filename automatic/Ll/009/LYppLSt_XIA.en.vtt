00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of a new experience that I think we all

handle<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.489> that

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
handle really well I think that that

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
handle really well I think that that
they<00:01:01.859> ask<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.399> questions<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.059> had<00:01:03.300> the

right<00:01:03.660> answers<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.220> end<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
right answers and I think the end of the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.039 
right answers and I think the end of the
day<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> show<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.659> kick-ass
