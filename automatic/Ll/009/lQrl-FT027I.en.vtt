greenies a man so this is a mud crab

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
greenies a man so this is a mud crab
trap<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.400> we've<00:00:14.519> got<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.719> course

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
trap that we've got here and of course

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.640 
trap that we've got here and of course
you<00:00:15.960> need<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.170> bait

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
you need to bait

you need to bait
so<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> barramundi<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:17.760> on

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so the barramundi is going to go on

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
so the barramundi is going to go on
there<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.330> want<00:00:18.449> where<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.750> we

there so what do you want where do we
need<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.050> tie<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.650> greenie<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.220> reckon<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
need to tie that greenie you reckon to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
need to tie that greenie you reckon to
this<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> bottom<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.410> where

can<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> their<00:00:37.320> side

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
can go to their side

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
can go to their side
okay<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.390> lead<00:00:39.750> end<00:00:39.930> only

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
okay because we want that lead end only

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.709 
okay because we want that lead end only
where<00:00:40.379> those<00:00:40.530> funnels<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:41.129> okay<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.540> it'll

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
where those funnels are okay and it'll

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.770 
where those funnels are okay and it'll
come<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:44.059> yeah<00:00:45.090> we'll<00:00:45.480> put<00:00:45.660> him

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
come right in there yeah we'll put him

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
come right in there yeah we'll put him
in<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> water<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.530> give<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.100> couple<00:00:47.489> hours

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
in the water and give it a couple hours

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.549 
in the water and give it a couple hours
and<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.090> how<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.300> got<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and see how we got here we go so this

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.860 
and see how we got here we go so this
won't<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:50.039> back<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> close<00:00:51.210> him<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.570> so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
won't this bit back up I close him up so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
won't this bit back up I close him up so
thread<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.530> through<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:54.420> far<00:00:54.570> as

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
thread that through and then as far as

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.740 
thread that through and then as far as
tides<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.680> putting<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> traps<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.750> if

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
tides go for putting the traps out if

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
tides go for putting the traps out if
you're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> leave<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:59.059> the<00:01:00.059> summer

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you're going to leave them the summer

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.209 
you're going to leave them the summer
time<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> guess<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> find<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> place

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
time I guess it's good to find a place

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
time I guess it's good to find a place
that<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.579> still<00:01:02.820> access<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.420> low<00:01:03.600> tide<00:01:03.930> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that you can still access on low tide so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
that you can still access on low tide so
you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.519> but

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you can get in and get them but but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
you can get in and get them but but
somewhere<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> floods<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.439> those<00:01:07.619> crabs

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
somewhere where it floods up those crabs

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.320 
somewhere where it floods up those crabs
will<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> shallows<00:01:08.760> certainly

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
will come up into the shallows certainly

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
will come up into the shallows certainly
at<00:01:09.420> nighttime<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.990> food<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.560> very

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
at nighttime and food right and very

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.320 
at nighttime and food right and very
shallow<00:01:11.189> water<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.580> her<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> little

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shallow water on her if you get a little

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
shallow water on her if you get a little
lighter<00:01:12.479> towards<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:13.080> dangerous<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
lighter towards pretty dangerous to do

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.539 
lighter towards pretty dangerous to do
in<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.770> part<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> world<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.460> going

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in this part of the world you're going

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.890 
in this part of the world you're going
to<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.820> eaten<00:01:15.000> by<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> bit

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to get eaten by so I think it's a bit

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
to get eaten by so I think it's a bit
bigger<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.619> they'll<00:01:16.770> come<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
bigger but they'll come right up in the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
bigger but they'll come right up in the
shallows<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.000> need<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> set<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> set<00:01:19.140> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
shallows you need to set that set that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
shallows you need to set that set that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
trap in an area Creek mouths are really

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
trap in an area Creek mouths are really
good<00:01:21.600> green<00:01:22.259> depends<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:22.890> part<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> the

good green depends on what part of the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
flights are just sitting on the surface

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.649 
flights are just sitting on the surface
and<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.820> got<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.570> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
let's sort of thing but you guys put

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
let's sort of thing but you guys put
them<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> trees<00:01:30.420> yeah<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:31.710> because

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
them in the trees yeah that's because

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.100 
them in the trees yeah that's because
the<00:01:32.220> Crocs<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.790> hang<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the Crocs do hang around where all the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
the Crocs do hang around where all the
muddies<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.460> pots<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
muddies are in the pots and they like to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
muddies are in the pots and they like to
play<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.990> these<00:01:37.140> floats<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.490> can't

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
play with these floats and then we can't

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340 
play with these floats and then we can't
find<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.150> our<00:01:39.299> pots<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.200> they've

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
find where our pots are because they've

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
find where our pots are because they've
written<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.400> throw<00:01:41.640> them<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
written a bit so we throw them up in the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
written a bit so we throw them up in the
trees<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:43.470> lot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> people<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.100> realize

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
trees and a lot of people don't realize

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.600 
trees and a lot of people don't realize
the<00:01:44.759> main<00:01:45.060> type<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.600> mud<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.619> sorry<00:01:46.950> crocodile

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the main type to mud for sorry crocodile

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.510 
the main type to mud for sorry crocodile
is<00:01:47.820> mud<00:01:48.149> crap<00:01:48.439> I<00:01:49.439> thought<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.100> were<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> main

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is mud crap I thought you were the main

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
is mud crap I thought you were the main
sort<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> instigator<00:01:51.600> when<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.840> came<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sort of instigator when it came to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
sort of instigator when it came to
eating<00:01:52.229> mud<00:01:52.439> crabs<00:01:52.710> made<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> Crocs<00:01:53.460> even

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
eating mud crabs made but the Crocs even

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.359 
eating mud crabs made but the Crocs even
a<00:01:53.729> bit<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.939> our<00:01:54.149> drivers<00:01:54.630> work<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:55.439> well<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
a bit of our drivers work up well and

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.590 
a bit of our drivers work up well and
I've<00:01:56.490> seen<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.939> things<00:01:57.119> chewed<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> bits

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I've seen these things chewed to bits

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.179 
I've seen these things chewed to bits
and<00:01:57.899> bits<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> foam<00:01:58.380> floating<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.070> river

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and bits of foam floating down the river

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.410 
and bits of foam floating down the river
and<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.579> obviously<00:01:59.939> where<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> crops

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and that's obviously where the crops

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.389 
and that's obviously where the crops
have<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.960> got<00:02:01.200> whole<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.310> we've

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
have have got whole of them so so we've

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
have have got whole of them so so we've
got<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.640> bait<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.329> our<00:02:03.479> trap<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
got our bait and this is our trap so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.780 
got our bait and this is our trap so
that<00:02:04.140> goes<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> bottom<00:02:05.670> layer

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that goes to the to the bottom layer

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.719 
that goes to the to the bottom layer
like<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> that's<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.489> entrance<00:02:08.489> doors

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
like so and that's our entrance doors

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
like so and that's our entrance doors
there<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> crab<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> come<00:02:10.020> off

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there so that crab is going to come off

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.350 
there so that crab is going to come off
hopefully<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:11.160> catch<00:02:11.489> some<00:02:11.730> my<00:02:11.849> wife's<00:02:12.150> near

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hopefully we catch some my wife's near

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.350 
hopefully we catch some my wife's near
time<00:02:12.540> difference

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
time difference

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.300 
time difference
but<00:02:13.810> you're<00:02:14.560> going<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.710> come<00:02:14.890> along<00:02:15.100> there

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
but you're going to come along there

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
but you're going to come along there
pushes<00:02:15.910> way<00:02:16.060> through<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.600> then<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.900> flap

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
pushes way through and then that flap

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.870 
pushes way through and then that flap
sort<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.470> closes<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.400> see<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.550> flap

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
sort of closes up you can see that flap

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.850 
sort of closes up you can see that flap
shuts<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:19.870> he's<00:02:19.960> inside<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.710> very

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
shuts so when he's inside it's a very

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.410 
shuts so when he's inside it's a very
difficult<00:02:21.070> friend<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.550> come<00:02:21.700> back<00:02:21.940> out<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
difficult friend to come back out you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.700 
difficult friend to come back out you
can<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> one's<00:02:22.990> close<00:02:23.230> right<00:02:23.500> together

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
can see that one's close right together

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.960 
can see that one's close right together
so<00:02:24.190> we're<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> slide<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.820> through

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so we're going to slide it in through

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.670 
so we're going to slide it in through
there<00:02:25.150> sit<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.510> there<00:02:25.690> we've<00:02:26.230> got<00:02:26.350> our<00:02:26.500> top

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
there sit in there we've got our top

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
there sit in there we've got our top
door<00:02:26.860> open<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.520> it's<00:02:27.610> pinned<00:02:27.940> shut<00:02:28.210> with

door open here and it's pinned shut with

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.440 
door open here and it's pinned shut with
this<00:02:29.050> little<00:02:29.320> gadget<00:02:29.740> at<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> side<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.240> if<00:02:31.360> we

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this little gadget at the side so if we

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.670 
this little gadget at the side so if we
do<00:02:31.570> any<00:02:31.780> crabs<00:02:32.050> we<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.410> simply<00:02:32.650> open

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
do any crabs we can just simply open

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280 
do any crabs we can just simply open
that<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.100> extract<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.910> crabs<00:02:34.180> either<00:02:34.900> rebate

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
that up extract the crabs either rebate

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.770 
that up extract the crabs either rebate

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
it or if the baits still pretty good we

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.150 
it or if the baits still pretty good we
can<00:02:37.900> put<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.140> back<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.440> well<00:02:38.710> make<00:02:38.860> them<00:02:38.890> Scalf

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
can put it back in well make them Scalf

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.330 
can put it back in well make them Scalf
honest<00:02:39.490> puts<00:02:39.730> my<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.910> spot<00:02:40.209> let's<00:02:40.510> go

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390 

just<00:02:46.340> agree<00:02:47.349> so<00:02:48.349> they<00:02:48.380> hold<00:02:48.680> creeks<00:02:49.069> coming

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
just agree so they hold creeks coming

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.270 
just agree so they hold creeks coming
out<00:02:49.550> here<00:02:49.760> right<00:02:49.940> run<00:02:50.480> out<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.099> like<00:02:52.250> a
