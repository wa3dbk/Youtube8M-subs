non-invasive<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.420> mean<00:03:10.600> like<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.810> little<00:03:11.170> bit

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
non-invasive I mean like a little bit

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.890 
non-invasive I mean like a little bit
honors<00:03:11.650> nature<00:03:12.010> no<00:03:12.400> downtime<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.780> your

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
honors nature no downtime so and your

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.050 
honors nature no downtime so and your
skin<00:03:14.140> feels<00:03:14.380> baby<00:03:14.770> small<00:03:15.190> baby<00:03:15.730> smooth

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
skin feels baby small baby smooth

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.330 
skin feels baby small baby smooth
afterwards<00:03:16.600> it's<00:03:16.870> fantastic<00:03:17.709> looks<00:03:18.130> great

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
afterwards it's fantastic looks great

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.160 
afterwards it's fantastic looks great
okay<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.000> what<00:03:19.150> about<00:03:19.300> safety<00:03:19.630> over<00:03:19.989> here

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
okay so and what about safety over here

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.690 
okay so and what about safety over here
to<00:03:20.290> know<00:03:20.650> something<00:03:21.070> that's<00:03:21.250> done<00:03:21.459> by<00:03:21.670> a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
to know something that's done by a

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.490 
to know something that's done by a
physician<00:03:22.150> we're<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.170> talk<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.350> little

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
physician we're going to talk a little

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.750 
physician we're going to talk a little
bit<00:03:23.680> about<00:03:23.830> all<00:03:23.980> therapy<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.640> do<00:03:24.730> a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
bit about all therapy and just do a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.580 
bit about all therapy and just do a
couple<00:03:24.940> pulses<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.870> an<00:03:26.019> ultrasound

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
couple pulses this is an ultrasound

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.290 
couple pulses this is an ultrasound
based<00:03:26.860> technology<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.550> can<00:03:27.640> see<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.060> like

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
based technology you can see just like

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.479 
based technology you can see just like
what<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:29.050> do<00:03:29.260> when<00:03:29.530> we're<00:03:29.709> monitoring<00:03:30.160> a

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
what we do when we're monitoring a

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.640 
what we do when we're monitoring a
baby's<00:03:30.820> progress<00:03:31.150> during<00:03:31.630> pregnancy<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.500> can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
baby's progress during pregnancy you can

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.699 
baby's progress during pregnancy you can
see<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.920> ultrasound<00:03:33.010> device<00:03:33.700> up<00:03:33.940> here<00:03:34.269> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
see the ultrasound device up here and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.860 
see the ultrasound device up here and
it's<00:03:35.709> used<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.550> penetrate<00:03:37.120> down<00:03:37.360> below<00:03:37.690> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
it's used to penetrate down below the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.420 
it's used to penetrate down below the
skin<00:03:38.200> down<00:03:38.530> below<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.950> fat<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.340> our

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
skin down below the fat to our

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.699 
skin down below the fat to our
connective<00:03:39.880> tissue<00:03:40.120> which<00:03:40.780> becomes<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.500> little

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
connective tissue which becomes a little

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770 
connective tissue which becomes a little
bit<00:03:41.830> more<00:03:41.980> saggy<00:03:42.430> over<00:03:42.850> time<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.450> going

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
bit more saggy over time and that going

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.650 
bit more saggy over time and that going
to<00:03:43.870> happen<00:03:44.140> yeah<00:03:44.440> yeah<00:03:44.709> skin<00:03:45.070> laxity<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.940> we'll

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
to happen yeah yeah skin laxity so we'll

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.030 
to happen yeah yeah skin laxity so we'll
show<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.050> couple<00:03:47.200> pulses<00:03:47.680> here<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:47.920> can

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
show you a couple pulses here you can

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.770 
show you a couple pulses here you can
see<00:03:48.220> I've<00:03:48.370> marked<00:03:48.730> her<00:03:48.940> where<00:03:49.150> we<00:03:49.180> treat<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.570> in

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
see I've marked her where we treat it in

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.050 
see I've marked her where we treat it in
the<00:03:49.900> neck<00:03:50.140> area<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.040> cheek<00:03:51.310> area<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.910> also

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the neck area the cheek area and also

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060 
the neck area the cheek area and also
around<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.510> brows<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.989> lift<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.320> brows<00:03:53.530> lift

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
around the brows to lift the brows lift

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.460 
around the brows to lift the brows lift
the<00:03:54.220> jawline<00:03:54.489> lift<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.150> neck<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.810> we'll<00:03:56.320> do

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
the jawline lift the neck and we'll do

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.020 
the jawline lift the neck and we'll do
one<00:03:56.709> pulse<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:57.550> so<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.670> can<00:03:57.820> get<00:03:57.970> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
one pulse here just so you can get a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.530 
one pulse here just so you can get a
sense<00:03:58.300> of<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.620> this<00:03:59.739> is<00:03:59.800> no<00:04:00.519> down<00:04:00.850> time<00:04:01.150> it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
sense of it but this is no down time it

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.559 
sense of it but this is no down time it
takes<00:04:01.780> about<00:04:02.019> an<00:04:02.290> hour<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.650> do<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.360> it's<00:04:04.360> just

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
takes about an hour to do and it's just

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.059 
takes about an hour to do and it's just
all<00:04:04.750> these<00:04:04.900> little<00:04:05.140> lines<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.620> typical

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
all these little lines a typical

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.340 
all these little lines a typical
procedure<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:06.910> about<00:04:07.090> 600<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.750> 800<00:04:07.930> of

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
procedure we do about 600 to 800 of

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.270 
procedure we do about 600 to 800 of
these<00:04:08.500> pulses<00:04:08.950> which

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
these pulses which

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.040 
these pulses which
call<00:04:09.520> lines<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.060> over<00:04:10.270> about<00:04:10.360> three<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.840> six

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
call lines and over about three to six

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.990 
call lines and over about three to six
months<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.500> causes<00:04:11.800> collagen<00:04:12.280> generation<00:04:12.819> and

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
months it causes collagen generation and

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.880 
months it causes collagen generation and
tightening<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.600> skin<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.560> this<00:04:14.740> is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
tightening of the skin so and so this is

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.500 
tightening of the skin so and so this is
something<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.459> would<00:04:15.610> do<00:04:15.819> every<00:04:16.209> say

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
something that you would do every say

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.180 
something that you would do every say
three<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.750> six<00:04:17.049> months<00:04:17.109> or<00:04:17.470> you<00:04:17.620> do<00:04:17.769> one<00:04:17.980> time

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
three to six months or you do one time

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.370 
three to six months or you do one time
in<00:04:18.370> goods<00:04:18.519> on<00:04:18.700> its<00:04:19.000> FDA<00:04:19.419> approved<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> year

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
in goods on its FDA approved for a year

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.080 
in goods on its FDA approved for a year
you<00:04:20.530> probably<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> little<00:04:21.489> longer<00:04:21.639> out<00:04:21.940> of

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
you probably get a little longer out of

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.520 
you probably get a little longer out of
it<00:04:22.240> but<00:04:22.389> I<00:04:22.510> always<00:04:22.660> talk<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.110> patients<00:04:23.260> about

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
it but I always talk to patients about

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.629

constantly fighting aging so there's a

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.750 
constantly fighting aging so there's a
little<00:04:26.680> bit<00:04:26.830> kind<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.250> like<00:04:27.340> getting<00:04:27.490> oil
