the find one if you want depending on
what<00:00:43.469> sort<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> tree<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.280> usually<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
what sort of tree I usually get a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
what sort of tree I usually get a
mixture<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> light<00:00:45.960> green<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.700> dark

mixture of the light green and the dark

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.680 
mixture of the light green and the dark
room<00:00:49.129> these<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> 32<00:00:50.969> ounce<00:00:51.000> bottles

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
room these are the 32 ounce bottles

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
room these are the 32 ounce bottles
there<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.260> eight<00:00:52.920> nine<00:00:53.430> dollars<00:00:53.879> depends

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
there about eight nine dollars depends

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
there about eight nine dollars depends
where<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.629> them<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.230> usually<00:00:55.949> then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
where you get them from I usually then

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
where you get them from I usually then
mix<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> those<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.620> ice

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
mix the two of those into just a of ice

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.760 
mix the two of those into just a of ice
cream<00:00:59.190> container<00:01:00.109> there'll<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.140> enough<00:01:01.500> there

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
cream container there'll be enough there

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.719 
cream container there'll be enough there
to<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.899> probably<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.170> 400<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.339> trees

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to do probably about 400 of these trees

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
to do probably about 400 of these trees
so<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.780> economical<00:01:07.610> get<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> little

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
so they're very economical get a little

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
so they're very economical get a little
bit<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.750> white<00:01:09.960> blue<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.760> some<00:01:11.760> water<00:01:12.170> so

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
this does that be a bit messy but

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.160 
this does that be a bit messy but
doesn't<00:01:52.110> matter<00:01:52.229> ok<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.189> once<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.640> done
