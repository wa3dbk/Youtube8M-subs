00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
called liquid white and this is quite an
important<00:00:17.100> step<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> whole<00:00:17.880> painting

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
important step for the whole painting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.140 
important step for the whole painting
and<00:00:18.840> I've<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.160> done<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.939> don't

really want to see me painting white
onto<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.189> white<00:00:23.430> canvas<00:00:24.109> but<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.650> must<00:00:25.859> do

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is you must scrub it in people think

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
is you must scrub it in people think
that<00:00:28.410> you're<00:00:28.590> painting<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.039> wall<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that you're painting a wall it's not the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
that you're painting a wall it's not the
case<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.170> need<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.439> scrub<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.130> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
case at all you need to scrub it in and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.970 
case at all you need to scrub it in and
the<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.239> trick<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.710> put<00:00:34.890> your

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the little trick is you just put your

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
the little trick is you just put your
fingers<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.840> see

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
fingers on I don't know if you can see

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.280 
fingers on I don't know if you can see
that<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> camera<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.790> thing

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
that in the camera but it's just thing

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.770 
that in the camera but it's just thing
like<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> thumbprint<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> once<00:00:42.390> you've<00:00:42.570> done

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
like a thumbprint so once you've done

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.130 
like a thumbprint so once you've done
that<00:00:43.700> we're<00:00:44.700> gonna<00:00:44.760> paint<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> seascape<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that we're gonna paint the seascape and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we're gonna paint the seascape and
so<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so you need to just have a little bit of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.439 
so you need to just have a little bit of
masking<00:00:48.809> tape<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.800> horizon<00:00:50.520> take

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
masking tape just for your horizon take

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
masking tape just for your horizon take
a<00:00:51.480> brush<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.230> lazier<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> crimson<00:00:53.280> we're<00:00:53.640> gonna

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a brush a lazier in crimson we're gonna

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.869 
a brush a lazier in crimson we're gonna
have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> sunset<00:00:55.879> crisscross

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
have a little bit of a sunset crisscross

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.200 
have a little bit of a sunset crisscross
stroke<00:00:57.770> you<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> balanced

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stroke you don't want it to be balanced

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
stroke you don't want it to be balanced
you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.989> perfect

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you don't want it to be perfect

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.890 
you don't want it to be perfect
nature<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> higgledy-piggledy<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.840> I<00:01:06.840> think

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
nature is higgledy-piggledy and I think

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140 
nature is higgledy-piggledy and I think
crisscross<00:01:07.590> strokes<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.430> create<00:01:08.760> quite<00:01:09.000> an

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
crisscross strokes can create quite an

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.410 
crisscross strokes can create quite an
ethereal<00:01:09.750> effect<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> sky<00:01:11.150> take<00:01:12.150> some

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
ethereal effect with the sky take some

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.770 
ethereal effect with the sky take some
Mountain<00:01:12.900> mixture<00:01:14.240> just<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.720> on

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
Mountain mixture just get that on

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.460 
Mountain mixture just get that on
underneath<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> bright

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
underneath this is going to be a bright

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
underneath this is going to be a bright
painting<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.740> those<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.150> me

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
painting and those people that know me

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.039 
painting and those people that know me
know<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.900> bright<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> Mountain<00:01:24.869> makes

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
know that I'm bright so Mountain makes

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
know that I'm bright so Mountain makes
let's<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.460> we're

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
let's get it on there and then we're

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
let's get it on there and then we're
going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.479> some<00:01:27.840> phthalo<00:01:28.290> blue<00:01:28.610> just

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
going to get some phthalo blue just

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.670 
going to get some phthalo blue just
start<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> corners<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.320> trick

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
start in the corners that's the trick

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.020 
start in the corners that's the trick
with<00:01:31.920> phthalo<00:01:32.430> blue<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:34.530> looks<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.100> strange

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
with phthalo blue it looks a bit strange

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
with phthalo blue it looks a bit strange
at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> moment<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.049> rainbow<00:01:37.740> ish<00:01:37.950> but

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
