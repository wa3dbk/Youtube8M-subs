00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.020
 Today we are going to prepare Valencian horchata 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.349
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.259
 to make the horchata are 250 grams of 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.889
 Tigernuts 1 liter of cold water and 125 grams 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.430
 of sugar and we already have the sugar 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.430
 Tigernuts and water 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.760
 Now we take an empty bowl and go to 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.970
 add the tiger nuts 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.750
 next we are going to add water 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 until covering them this process is for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 hydrate the tiger nuts we will leave them in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.250
 soak for 24 hours and we will 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:47.910
 change the water every 8 is to say three 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 times after 24 hours the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.300
 we wash if we drain them well and this is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 the result that we will have obtained now 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.180
 we take the tigernuts and we are going to put them 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.739
 in a bowl to which we are going to add 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.739
 250 milliliters of cold water 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 I do not think so 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.640
 now with the help of a blender we are going 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.000
 to crush until you get a good dough 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 fine 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.899
 now you will see the texture that owes you 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.179
 staying the next step is not necessary 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.009
 but I like to let it marinate in the 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.570
 refrigerator for two hours so that it 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.570
 He nods the flavor 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.630
 After this time we take the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.610
 Tigernuts and let's add the 750 ml of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.330
 remaining waters and with the help of 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.330
 we will remove it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
 yes 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 once we have it, we will take a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.520
 cotton strainer and we're going to strain 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.310
 It can be done with another type of colander 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.140
 but I recommend the cotton strainer 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.769
 since I will assure you jce that is not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.769
 no group 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.860
 once we have it well drained these 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.370
 are the remains of tiger nut that are going to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 which are going to be discarded 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.170
 now once we have the horchata 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.819
 let's add the sugar and let's 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.819
 stir until dissolved 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.220
 and now we can serve it well 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.220
 cool 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.010
 and we will have our delicious 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.230
 typical chufa of tigernut from ValÃ¨ncia 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.099
