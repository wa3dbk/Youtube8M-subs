actually<00:01:16.530> an<00:01:16.590> added<00:01:16.860> value<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.810> lastly<00:01:18.810> is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
actually an added value there lastly is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.310 
actually an added value there lastly is
the<00:01:19.290> actual<00:01:19.650> locating<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> springs<00:01:21.320> we

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the actual locating on the springs we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.100 
the actual locating on the springs we
