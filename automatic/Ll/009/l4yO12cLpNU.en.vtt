00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.419
 decides on this in general 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.670
 assembly 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.670
 I think that we are just oooh cold and snow 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.399
 to 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.579
 don't see success 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.139
 continue to work 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 made kovtun 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.470
 however transplant, I think it's bad 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.310
 he is a great football player 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.829
 but we decided for ourselves what we need 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.529
 homeless 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.449
 never say never 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.449
 for communication and joint concert 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.590
 what you need fakes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950
 providers 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 but we had several joint 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.680
 concerts 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 during the festival father 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580
 and in preparation 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.870
 let's say the festival 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.780
 such a question that is about the return 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.650
 he gave up 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.700
 I will not say that they were aria musicians on 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.720
 just in case 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 producers before the concert gave up and what about 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.900
 that is, literally the next home and where 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.300
 do 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.240
 and then which 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.730
 gruel formally talking to him 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.010
 second i tried 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.280
 exposure chapter 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 and maybe 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.300
 I am glad of the possibility of it 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.820
 return by you 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.540
 but I received no answer 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.000
 based on the fact that he does not know 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 but what is it 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.490
 no need at this stage 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.450
 masters it is written 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 then when people start and therefore 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.570
 to explain issues 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.090
 after settling in Moscow 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.360
 I can tell you that in the waters either 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.710
 vitali and vladimir 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.970
 in childhood this is a big party 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700
 they are completely different in character 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.479
 n 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.930
 m tell you how 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.770
 we are spheres of influence of the group why am I also in 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.960
 Enganche principle displeased 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.640
 it is endowed that is vitalia can 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.970
 answer for the creative quota 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.210
 component yes 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.680
 m 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.050
 for Ukraine may be more 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.360
 he knows how difficult 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.350
 other direction the same fate can 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.609
 pinpoint 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 that is, and each of them is roaming 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.119
 strong enough family 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.909
 After all, if any 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.549
 such characteristics I want to be there under 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.409
 the leadership of Dmitry Tabachnik fist on 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:23.680
 table and
