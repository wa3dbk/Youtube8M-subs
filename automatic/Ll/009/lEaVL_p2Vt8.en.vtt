00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.800
 the tower bar emptied here the depth of everything 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.140

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.830
 bad kitchen on two or three meters like 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.810
 We are going to bite the sky 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.720
 move side well as closer to 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.930
 fairway to a greater depth of 6 meters 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.420
 on example 8, we will find whether we are going there 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 we lived about a kilometer not 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.009
 pity legs came here now to these here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 fishermen are not approximately paradise 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.229
 caponiers in what and what they also sit 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 In general, we got to the spread 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.990
 before this crowd but in general we came out 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.009
 from there, that is, there is a car here 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.780
 this here is a hill 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:20.480
 but what can't you do for rm but you 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.480
 still every fish is an adventure 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.489
 someone's classic fishing situation 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.879
 one caught come on come on come on 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.560
 drilled the axes of the body four people we 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.080
 Now let's see all there cook 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 why not we won't stay 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.620
 to the side 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.670
 here 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.819
 yes and here 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.540
 pecked spat I think it's clear who 's about 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.540
 splash 2 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.190
 and 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780
 but 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:05.139
 so what everyone is starting to gather 

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:10.799
 time 5 hours and we still have to go well somewhere 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.799
 an hour probably if not more 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.339
 our catch is basically 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:20.909
 humble well although you no longer need me 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:26.889
 I think that it is quite enough 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:30.479
 Well, and all anglers refueling with 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.479
