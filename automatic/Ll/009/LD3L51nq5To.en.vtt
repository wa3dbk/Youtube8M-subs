00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
a rock star name I can't use in chair

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.450 
a rock star name I can't use in chair
next<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.750> me<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.320> had<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> baseball<00:00:34.800> accident

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
next to me I had had a baseball accident

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
next to me I had had a baseball accident
my<00:00:35.579> nose<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:36.030> whacked<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.440> face<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
my nose was whacked out of my face and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.910 
my nose was whacked out of my face and
as<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.149> waiting<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.809> overheard<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
as I was waiting I overheard in the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
as I was waiting I overheard in the
other<00:00:41.070> room<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.390> rock<00:00:42.540> star<00:00:42.780> had

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
other room that the rock star had

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.520 
other room that the rock star had
apparently<00:00:43.969> snorted<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.149> much<00:00:45.300> cocaine<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
apparently snorted so much cocaine that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
apparently snorted so much cocaine that
it<00:00:46.649> ain't<00:00:46.860> through<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> septum<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.420> had

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it ain't through the septum and they had

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.970 
it ain't through the septum and they had
to<00:00:48.690> put<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> Teflon<00:00:49.350> implant<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.890> were

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
to put a Teflon implant they were

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.850 
to put a Teflon implant they were
discussing<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.520> Teflon<00:00:51.059> implant<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> good

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
discussing a Teflon implant is that good

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
discussing a Teflon implant is that good
if<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> small<00:00:53.610> enough<00:00:53.910> area<00:00:54.270> whether<00:00:54.539> from

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
if it's a small enough area whether from

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.529 
if it's a small enough area whether from
trauma<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.620> whatever<00:00:56.120> usually<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.239> try<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
trauma or whatever usually we'll try and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
trauma or whatever usually we'll try and
rearrange<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> septum<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.859> there

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
rearrange the septum that's there

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
rearrange the septum that's there
because<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.399> much<00:00:59.550> better<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> your

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
because it's much better to have your

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760 
because it's much better to have your
own<00:01:00.149> tissues<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:01.109> it'll<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:01.559> care<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
own tissues then it'll take care of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.080 
own tissues then it'll take care of
themselves<00:01:01.980> better<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
themselves better you don't have to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
themselves better you don't have to
flaunt<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> frying<00:01:03.840> pan<00:01:03.960> yes<00:01:04.710> both<00:01:05.640> system

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
flaunt from a frying pan yes both system

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260 
flaunt from a frying pan yes both system
provide<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.689> ya<00:01:07.380> foreign<00:01:07.710> body<00:01:07.860> too<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.119> we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
provide for ya foreign body too so so we

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.500 
provide for ya foreign body too so so we
were<00:01:09.390> talking<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.840> building<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.350> noses

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
were talking about building up noses

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.820 
were talking about building up noses
yeah<00:01:12.510> sometimes<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.049> build<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.439> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
yeah sometimes we do build them up so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
yeah sometimes we do build them up so
like<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> typical<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.240> Ryan<00:01:15.960> apply<00:01:16.170> say<00:01:16.320> it

like a typical and Ryan apply say it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
like a typical and Ryan apply say it
will<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.710> someone<00:01:17.280> who<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.729> very<00:01:18.689> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
will do for someone who has very little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
will do for someone who has very little
fullness<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.680> area<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.070> four<00:01:20.340> asian<00:01:20.790> or

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fullness in this area be four asian or

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
fullness in this area be four asian or
whatever<00:01:21.780> ethnicity<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:23.009> want<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> build<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
whatever ethnicity we want to build that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
back up the bridge sometimes it's too

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.140 
back up the bridge sometimes it's too
much<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> local<00:01:26.400> tissue<00:01:26.549> somebody

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
much to use the local tissue somebody

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.780 
much to use the local tissue somebody
else<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.570> would<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.810> willing<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.259> ask<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.700> know

else I would be willing to ask you know
eventually<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.630> able<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> off

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
eventually we will be able to get it off

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
eventually we will be able to get it off
the<00:01:31.229> shelf<00:01:31.350> there's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> research

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the shelf there's a lot of research

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819 
the shelf there's a lot of research
being<00:01:33.270> done<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.720> tissue<00:01:33.930> modeling<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.650> being

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
being done in tissue modeling and being

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
being done in tissue modeling and being
able<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> grow<00:01:35.369> implants<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> could

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
able to grow implants that you could

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
able to grow implants that you could
actually<00:01:36.900> pick<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.890> shake<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> want

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
actually pick the shake that you want

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.550 
actually pick the shake that you want
and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:38.820> populate<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.840> cartilage<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and then populate it with cartilage and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
and then populate it with cartilage and
then<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> body<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.329> about

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then put that in the body that's about

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
then put that in the body that's about
too<00:01:42.750> far<00:01:42.960> off<00:01:43.110> well<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.890> isn't<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
too far off well I know this isn't the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
too far off well I know this isn't the
subject<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> our<00:01:44.850> discussion<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.570> are

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
subject of our discussion but they are

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.920 
subject of our discussion but they are
doing<00:01:45.960> face<00:01:46.729> transplants<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.880> sure<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
doing face transplants for sure but of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.469 
doing face transplants for sure but of
course<00:01:49.110> rejection<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> biggest

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
course rejection is one of the biggest

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.630 
course rejection is one of the biggest
writing<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.630> cartilages<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't<00:01:53.549> get

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
writing about cartilages it doesn't get

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
writing about cartilages it doesn't get
rejected<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.299> easily<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.290> sort<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
rejected very easily so it's sort of a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
rejected very easily so it's sort of a
privilege<00:01:55.979> substance<00:01:56.460> okay<00:01:56.939> um<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.600> brought

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
privilege substance okay um we brought

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.209 
privilege substance okay um we brought
some<00:01:57.990> pictures<00:01:58.110> before<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> after<00:01:58.920> pictures

some pictures before and after pictures
let's<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> roll<00:01:59.790> those<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.299> certainly<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
let's go to roll those and certainly it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
let's go to roll those and certainly it

that's a nose job this is nothing like
the<00:02:30.420> goals<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.900> want<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.410> look<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.950> was

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the goals we want it to look like it was

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.190 
the goals we want it to look like it was
always<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.580> right<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.299> course<00:02:33.480> okay

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
always like that right of course okay

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.979 
always like that right of course okay
and<00:02:34.440> next<00:02:34.620> picture<00:02:35.299> very<00:02:36.299> similar<00:02:36.660> notice<00:02:36.870> is

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and next picture very similar notice is

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.430 
and next picture very similar notice is
a<00:02:37.019> combination<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.849> nose<00:02:38.849> job<00:02:39.090> rhinoplasty

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
a combination of nose job rhinoplasty

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
a combination of nose job rhinoplasty
with<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> chin<00:02:40.830> implant<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.060> reason<00:02:42.209> for

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
with a chin implant and the reason for

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.940 
with a chin implant and the reason for
that<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.720> again<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> make<00:02:43.680> sure<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
that is again I like to make sure the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.650 
that is again I like to make sure the
proportions<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.579> face<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.970> right<00:02:45.150> her

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
proportions of the face are right her

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.900 
proportions of the face are right her
chin<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.079> back<00:02:46.260> behind<00:02:46.470> her<00:02:46.799> lips<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.730> is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
chin is back behind her lips and this is

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.370 
chin is back behind her lips and this is
able<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> way<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> bring<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> chin<00:02:49.079> forward

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
able a way to bring the chin forward

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.199 
able a way to bring the chin forward
with<00:02:49.650> an<00:02:49.799> implant<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.060> also

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
with an implant and then that also

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.089 
with an implant and then that also
balances<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.780> nose<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.319> decreases<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
balances the nose so it decreases the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.559 
balances the nose so it decreases the
projection<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> tip<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> nose<00:02:54.329> by

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
projection of the tip of the nose by

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.000 
projection of the tip of the nose by
making<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.079> chin<00:02:55.260> come<00:02:55.440> forwards<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.829> little

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
making the chin come forwards a little

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.949 
making the chin come forwards a little
bit<00:02:56.129> okay<00:02:56.519> but<00:02:56.670> there's<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:57.090> implant<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
bit okay but there's no implant in the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.170 
bit okay but there's no implant in the
nose<00:02:58.110> right<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.670> win<00:02:59.819> down<00:03:00.000> yeah

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
nose right that just to win down yeah

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.670 
nose right that just to win down yeah
I've<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.450> taken<00:03:00.599> down<00:03:00.900> some<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.440> bone

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
I've just taken down some of that bone

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.619 
I've just taken down some of that bone
and<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.250> cartilage<00:03:02.519> that's<00:03:02.790> that's

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
and some of the cartilage that's that's

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.449 
and some of the cartilage that's that's
holding<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> skin<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.799> nose<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.190> for

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
holding the skin of the nose up for

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.309 
holding the skin of the nose up for
words<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.540> tip<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:06.989> didn't<00:03:07.260> have

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
words and at the tip really didn't have

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.410 
words and at the tip really didn't have
to<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.620> too<00:03:07.829> much<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.819> reduce<00:03:09.120> some<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
to do too much just reduce some of the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.789 
to do too much just reduce some of the
cartilage<00:03:09.660> there<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.079> blended<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.680> with

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
cartilage there so that blended in with

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.110 
cartilage there so that blended in with
the<00:03:10.860> doors<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.340> since<00:03:11.579> we've<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:11.790> talking

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the doors and since we've been talking

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.390 
the doors and since we've been talking
about<00:03:12.209> implants<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.470> what<00:03:13.680> material<00:03:14.280> is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
about implants and what what material is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
about implants and what what material is
in<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.609> chin<00:03:14.819> there<00:03:15.420> are<00:03:15.540> two<00:03:15.720> main<00:03:15.989> implants

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
in the chin there are two main implants

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.900 
in the chin there are two main implants
that<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.769> use<00:03:16.889> one<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> silicon<00:03:17.760> implant

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
that we use one is a silicon implant

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
that we use one is a silicon implant
it's<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.389> solid<00:03:18.569> it's<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.350> something<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it's a solid it's it's not something I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.009 
it's a solid it's it's not something I
can<00:03:19.769> leak<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.850> solid<00:03:21.000> implant<00:03:21.420> any<00:03:21.900> other

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
can leak it's a solid implant any other

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.990 
can leak it's a solid implant any other
is<00:03:22.139> more<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> Teflon<00:03:22.920> it's<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.310> it'll

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
is more like a Teflon it's it it'll

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.309 
is more like a Teflon it's it it'll
actually<00:03:24.120> allow<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.420> body<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.750> grow<00:03:25.019> into<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
actually allow the body to grow into it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.140 
actually allow the body to grow into it
and<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.010> next<00:03:26.040> picture<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.970> is

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and the next picture here and this is

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.270 
and the next picture here and this is
someone<00:03:27.389> who<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:28.049> just<00:03:28.230> did<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.380> chin<00:03:28.620> so

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
someone who we just did the chin so

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.860 
someone who we just did the chin so
again<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.639> balance<00:03:29.940> out<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.060> nose<00:03:30.329> I've<00:03:30.660> left

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
again to balance out the nose I've left

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.059 
again to balance out the nose I've left
the<00:03:30.989> nose<00:03:31.139> alone<00:03:31.410> even<00:03:31.620> though<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.920> nose

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
the nose alone even though the nose

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.259 
the nose alone even though the nose
looks<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.370> little<00:03:32.489> different<00:03:32.639> between<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.150> two

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
looks a little different between the two

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.789 
looks a little different between the two
it<00:03:33.420> does<00:03:33.630> look<00:03:33.660> different<00:03:34.019> it's<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.709> because

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
it does look different it's like because

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.530 
it does look different it's like because
the<00:03:34.980> proportion<00:03:35.519> has<00:03:35.639> changed<00:03:36.030> okay<00:03:36.480> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the proportion has changed okay so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300 
the proportion has changed okay so
really<00:03:37.049> I'll<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.620> or<00:03:37.739> two<00:03:37.919> patients

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
really I'll have one or two patients

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.470 
really I'll have one or two patients
here<00:03:38.459> will<00:03:38.549> come<00:03:38.700> in<00:03:38.849> because<00:03:39.299> they're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
here will come in because they're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.879 
here will come in because they're
concerned<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> size<00:03:40.230> their<00:03:40.440> nose<00:03:40.650> and

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
concerned with the size their nose and

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.280 
concerned with the size their nose and
we'll<00:03:41.459> work<00:03:41.669> on<00:03:41.849> their<00:03:41.970> chin<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.660> their<00:03:43.139> nose

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
we'll work on their chin and their nose

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620 
we'll work on their chin and their nose
this<00:03:43.440> fine<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.190> all<00:03:44.340> illusion<00:03:44.700> really

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
this fine so it's all illusion really

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.599 
this fine so it's all illusion really
there<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.900> no<00:03:46.049> allusion<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.560> yes<00:03:46.829> because

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
there is no allusion to it yes because

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:48.920 
there is no allusion to it yes because
the<00:03:47.760> proportions<00:03:48.269> matter<00:03:48.480> more<00:03:48.750> than<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
the proportions matter more than the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.259 
the proportions matter more than the
absolute<00:03:49.079> size<00:03:49.579> are<00:03:50.579> there<00:03:50.790> certain<00:03:50.970> things

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
absolute size are there certain things

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.610 
absolute size are there certain things
that<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:51.630> do<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.019> don't<00:03:52.200> involve

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
that you can do that don't involve

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.379 
that you can do that don't involve
surgery<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.370> change<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:54.000> shape<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.359> nose

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
surgery to change the shape of the nose

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.360 
surgery to change the shape of the nose
ring<00:03:54.660> or<00:03:54.870> pretty<00:03:55.049> much<00:03:55.109> there<00:03:55.919> are<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.250> it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
ring or pretty much there are and it's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.830 
ring or pretty much there are and it's
interesting<00:03:56.549> cuz<00:03:56.760> I've<00:03:56.849> had<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> few<00:03:57.329> emails

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
interesting cuz I've had a few emails

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.509 
interesting cuz I've had a few emails
just<00:03:58.019> recently<00:03:58.530> about<00:03:58.769> non-surgical

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
just recently about non-surgical

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.430 
just recently about non-surgical
rhinoplasty<00:03:59.579> which<00:04:00.329> seems<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.049> an<00:04:01.169> oxymoron

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
rhinoplasty which seems like an oxymoron

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.930 
rhinoplasty which seems like an oxymoron
I<00:04:01.739> me<00:04:01.829> because<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.069> rhinoplasty<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.700> an

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
I me because of rhinoplasty is an

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.599 
I me because of rhinoplasty is an
operation<00:04:03.500> well<00:04:04.500> what<00:04:04.739> people<00:04:05.040> are<00:04:05.160> doing<00:04:05.310> is

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
operation well what people are doing is

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.550 
operation well what people are doing is
for<00:04:05.910> small<00:04:06.239> bumps<00:04:06.690> or<00:04:06.810> divots<00:04:07.169> on<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.380> nose

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
for small bumps or divots on the nose

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
for small bumps or divots on the nose
actually<00:04:08.310> using<00:04:08.579> a<00:04:08.639> filler<00:04:08.880> like<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.299> use<00:04:09.480> for

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
actually using a filler like we use for

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.599 
actually using a filler like we use for
some<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.139> wrinkles<00:04:10.470> around<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.430> nose

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
some of the wrinkles around the nose

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.000 
some of the wrinkles around the nose
around<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:12.000> mouth<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.169> we<00:04:13.260> can<00:04:13.410> replace<00:04:13.769> some

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
around the mouth so we can replace some

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.920 
around the mouth so we can replace some
areas<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.430> there's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.819> little<00:04:14.940> trauma<00:04:15.209> with<00:04:15.900> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
areas if there's a little trauma with a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.599 
areas if there's a little trauma with a
filler<00:04:16.289> it's<00:04:16.919> probably<00:04:17.070> not<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.519> be

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
filler it's probably not going to be

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.370 
filler it's probably not going to be
permanent<00:04:17.880> at<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.359> point<00:04:18.630> there<00:04:19.109> are<00:04:19.140> some

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
permanent at this point there are some

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.360 
permanent at this point there are some
that<00:04:19.530> are<00:04:19.590> permanent<00:04:20.039> but<00:04:20.099> I'm<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.250> little

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
that are permanent but I'm a little

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.470 
that are permanent but I'm a little
worried<00:04:20.640> about<00:04:20.760> putting<00:04:20.969> hard

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
worried about putting hard

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.720 
worried about putting hard
for<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.810> nose<00:04:21.990> that<00:04:22.590> may<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> road<00:04:23.070> or<00:04:23.280> cause

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
for the nose that may a road or cause

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.400 
for the nose that may a road or cause

trouble well because the bottom light it

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.290 
trouble well because the bottom light it
is<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.560> functioning<00:04:26.220> part<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.820> body<00:04:26.970> right
