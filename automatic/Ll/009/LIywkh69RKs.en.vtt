00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.380
 this event this year the elected officials have also not franois robin have 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.910
 obviously we have a great 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.920
 r1 the organization believes in the medical level they are 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:11.959
 not a lot 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.759
 it's mostly two brothers fell into the business moment that's 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.810
 especially to do 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.599
 1-2 then dokÃ© verdonck cd super doctors there is one who is emergency 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.550
 specialists 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.220
 and then his brother who is the twin brother of whom we never know 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.300
 addresses 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.529
 let's do the best 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 earthquakes and so his two brothers who manages all the relief that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.739
 are there so a doubt forgot to dose him nurses et cetera ireland 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.710
 makes a great family so it's given to them at the site made a car 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.520
 in the field 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.600
 this is what makes the helicopter available yes 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.540
 in europe the urgency here is a little story to tell this is school 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.140
 land and made available to the media we are therefore happy with you and 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.320
 faked photographs 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.629
 this obviously proved his priorities 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.090
 security is 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.980
 the effectiveness of the relief incidentally look at the fact that no evacuation 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.600
 we're looking at how it's going at the version I'm doing very well 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.100
 she informed mme marois 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 it is possible 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 at 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 close to 2000 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.500
 that's what called authoritarian 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.280
 so did not have a heart complaint 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420
 now i hope i will prove myself 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 after others 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.520
 avoid addiction for a long time so here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.500
 I do not hold league 1 berkine for my right bush which he passes because the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 left lung 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.960
 very quickly 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 in the device no meeting jean whitemanche will do nothing he did not 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.040
 given many predictions but by the time you compile the ispa 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.800
 it's normal because he panicked in his jacket 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.750
 ok so for us it's a patient who must not have pretty job sites 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.160
 transferred 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.949
 on the hospital with the surgical structures certainly 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 because of a clavicle fracture this year 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.689
 there is no vital failure for the moment interpretation 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.019
 on the other hand, it is necessary to have a good structure and possibly a scanner 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.090
 yes you do the medical team on the roads against number 920 541 points
