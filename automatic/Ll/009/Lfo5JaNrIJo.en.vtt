00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
the Burmese python is an invasive

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.420 
the Burmese python is an invasive
species<00:00:21.930> found<00:00:22.290> in<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.530> Everglades

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
species found in the Everglades

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.090 
species found in the Everglades
it's<00:00:24.029> quite<00:00:24.300> an<00:00:24.420> opportunistic<00:00:24.960> feeder<00:00:25.410> loves

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
it's quite an opportunistic feeder loves

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.940 
it's quite an opportunistic feeder loves
birds<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.420> recent<00:00:27.990> studies<00:00:28.020> indicate<00:00:28.410> that

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
birds and recent studies indicate that

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.939 
birds and recent studies indicate that
it's<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.670> eating<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> bird<00:00:30.330> eggs<00:00:30.949> they

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
it's actually eating the bird eggs they

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
it's actually eating the bird eggs they
also<00:00:32.129> like<00:00:32.580> small<00:00:33.059> mammals<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.780> are

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
also like small mammals and are

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:51.810 
also like small mammals and are
especially<00:00:34.199> fond<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.980> rodents

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.240 

in<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.030> instance<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.870> Python<00:00:54.590> killed<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:55.040> rat

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
in this instance a Python killed a rat

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.850 
in this instance a Python killed a rat
and<00:00:55.550> during<00:00:56.329> all<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.660> commotion<00:00:56.860> it

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
and during all the commotion it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.490 
and during all the commotion it
attracted<00:00:58.370> another<00:00:58.579> Python<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.660> scent<00:01:00.320> of

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
attracted another Python the scent of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.470 
attracted another Python the scent of
the<00:01:00.680> rat<00:01:00.890> gets<00:01:01.280> all<00:01:01.460> over<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.970> first<00:01:02.210> snake

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
the rat gets all over the first snake

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.450 
the rat gets all over the first snake
and<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.809> second<00:01:03.230> snake<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.070> second

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
and the second snake and the second

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.789 
and the second snake and the second
snake<00:01:04.699> comes<00:01:04.970> in<00:01:05.210> there<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.600> eat<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.810> rat<00:01:06.200> but

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
snake comes in there to eat the rat but

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.430 
snake comes in there to eat the rat but
because<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.940> scent<00:01:08.210> getting<00:01:08.960> all<00:01:09.140> over

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
because of the scent getting all over

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.770 
because of the scent getting all over
both<00:01:09.619> snakes<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.729> actual<00:01:11.090> prey<00:01:11.390> becomes

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
both snakes the actual prey becomes

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.350 
both snakes the actual prey becomes
indistinguishable<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.490> they're<00:01:14.149> just

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
indistinguishable so they're just

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.200 
indistinguishable so they're just
coiling<00:01:14.990> around<00:01:15.080> each<00:01:15.530> other<00:01:15.860> trying<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.790> find

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
coiling around each other trying to find

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:51.320 
coiling around each other trying to find
this<00:01:17.450> phrase

the head of the smaller one will prevent

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.480 
the head of the smaller one will prevent
it<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.060> breathing<00:01:57.660> within<00:01:58.590> 30<00:01:58.830> minutes<00:01:59.130> the

it from breathing within 30 minutes the
smaller<00:01:59.790> snake<00:02:00.120> will<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> dead<00:02:01.130> when<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
smaller snake will be dead when the
