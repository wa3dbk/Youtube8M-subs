cold<00:01:16.539> well<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.410> suppose<00:01:18.039> that<00:01:18.100> he<00:01:18.399> has<00:01:18.550> taken

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940

some<00:01:18.970> aspirin<00:01:19.539> or<00:01:19.660> Tylenol<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.590> time<00:01:20.890> okay

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
some aspirin or Tylenol at one time okay

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
so we will need a co AG profile and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.210 
so we will need a co AG profile and
liver<00:01:24.820> function<00:01:25.149> studies<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:26.020> possibly<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.619> CT
