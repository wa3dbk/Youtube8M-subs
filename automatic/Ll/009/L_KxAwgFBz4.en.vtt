is bauxite it's a new or and it's what
you<00:00:15.120> need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.599> craft<00:00:15.929> most<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.440> these<00:00:16.529> things

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
you need to craft most of these things

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.790 
you need to craft most of these things
now<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.160> looks<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.520> similar<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> iron<00:00:18.800> but

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
now it looks very similar to iron but

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
now it looks very similar to iron but
has<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> few<00:00:20.279> differences<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.000> can't<00:00:21.300> mine<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
has a few differences you can't mine it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.009 
has a few differences you can't mine it
with<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> stone<00:00:22.320> pickaxe<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.010> need<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:24.019> iron

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
with a stone pickaxe you need an iron

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.150 
with a stone pickaxe you need an iron
pickaxe<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> -<00:00:26.119> also<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.900> will<00:00:28.050> only<00:00:28.199> spawn<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pickaxe to - also it will only spawn in

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.530 
pickaxe to - also it will only spawn in
extreme<00:00:29.730> hills<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.330> forest<00:00:31.320> biomes<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.540> when

it<00:00:33.660> does<00:00:33.840> born<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> those<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.710> only<00:00:34.860> be

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
it does born in those it will only be

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
it does born in those it will only be
above<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.880> level<00:00:36.090> 41<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:36.899> level<00:00:37.260> 41<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> above

aluminium<00:01:27.750> ingot

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
aluminium ingot

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
aluminium ingot
fits<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.250> nicely<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.390> gonna

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
fits on there nicely now we're gonna

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.880 
fits on there nicely now we're gonna
bash<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.079> our<00:01:31.350> hammer

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
bash it with our hammer

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.969 
bash it with our hammer
we<00:01:32.759> should<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.270> three<00:01:34.020> animations<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
we should get three animations is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
we should get three animations is
probably<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.090> slower<00:01:36.390> than

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
probably going to be a bit slower than

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.100 
probably going to be a bit slower than
the<00:01:36.810> making<00:01:37.619> pokeballs<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.880> bases<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the making pokeballs or bases and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
the making pokeballs or bases and
eventually<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.950> should<00:01:41.009> go<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.850> nice

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
eventually it should go into a nice

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.539 
eventually it should go into a nice
little<00:01:42.420> square<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.530> four<00:01:43.950> little

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
little square like that with four little

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.100 
little square like that with four little
white<00:01:44.850> corners<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:45.689> how<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.899> know

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
white corners and that's how you know

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.749 
white corners and that's how you know
it's<00:01:46.259> done<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.149> aluminium<00:01:48.360> plate

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
it's done and that is an aluminium plate

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.210 
it's done and that is an aluminium plate
lovely<00:01:50.780> I'll<00:01:51.780> move<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.409> master<00:01:52.799> walls<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.130> the

previous videos if you want to speed up
that<00:02:16.709> time<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.730> put<00:02:17.909> efficiency<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.629> your

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that time you can put efficiency on your

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.350 
that time you can put efficiency on your
hammer<00:02:18.989> or<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.190> use<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> diamond<00:02:20.730> hammer<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.110 
hammer or you can use a diamond hammer a
better<00:02:22.049> grade<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.830> material<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.819> your<00:02:23.970> hammer

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
better grade of material on your hammer
