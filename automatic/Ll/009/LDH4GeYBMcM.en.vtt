shedding<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.880> around<00:00:33.059> four<00:00:34.020> months<00:00:34.380> when

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
shedding I think around four months when

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920 
shedding I think around four months when
Jana<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.890> four<00:00:35.130> months<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.520> believe<00:00:35.750> it<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Jana was four months I believe it just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
Jana was four months I believe it just
started<00:00:37.260> shedding<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.160> crazy<00:00:38.820> because

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
started shedding like crazy because

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.430 
started shedding like crazy because
during<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:39.960> pregnancy

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
during your pregnancy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.799 
during your pregnancy
you<00:00:40.920> don't<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.640> shed<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.660> know

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you don't really shed you you know

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
you don't really shed you you know
you're<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.100> hair<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you're all this all the hair that you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
you're all this all the hair that you
didn't<00:00:44.820> shed<00:00:45.000> during<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.570> pregnancy

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you're basically shedding afterwards so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.970

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
four months and it stopped around six

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.110 
four months and it stopped around six
