improvement on both nowadays is a big

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.740 
improvement on both nowadays is a big
advantage<00:03:01.129> because<00:03:04.419> instead<00:03:05.419> of<00:03:05.480> creating

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
advantage because instead of creating

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.409 
advantage because instead of creating
two<00:03:05.900> cameras<00:03:06.290> new<00:03:06.470> lenses<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.299> would<00:03:08.299> have

created one camera one lens and people

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.309 
created one camera one lens and people
have<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.989> benefits<00:03:12.319> of<00:03:12.439> both<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:14.200> right<00:03:15.200> now

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319
