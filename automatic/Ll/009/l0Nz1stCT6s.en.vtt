shoulder muscles up here than their

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.589 
shoulder muscles up here than their
chest<00:04:06.199> muscles<00:04:06.680> how<00:04:07.400> they<00:04:07.579> develop<00:04:08.120> develop

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
chest muscles how they develop develop

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.469 
chest muscles how they develop develop
them<00:04:08.720> properly<00:04:09.109> if<00:04:09.319> they're<00:04:09.470> attached<00:04:09.889> there

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479

but<00:04:12.129> especially<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.370> lump<00:04:13.729> sticking<00:04:14.090> out

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
but especially that lump sticking out

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.120 
but especially that lump sticking out
like<00:04:14.389> their<00:04:14.569> shoulders<00:04:15.290> they're<00:04:15.470> like<00:04:15.769> I

don't see how the hell that worked but
it<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:18.979> be<00:04:19.070> interesting<00:04:19.220> if<00:04:19.669> they<00:04:19.789> made<00:04:19.940> a

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
it would be interesting if they made a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
won't do either they'll just because

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.970 
won't do either they'll just because
they<00:04:33.750> shouldn't<00:04:33.930> reuniting<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> birdies
