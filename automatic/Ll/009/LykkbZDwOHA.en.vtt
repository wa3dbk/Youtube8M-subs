00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
you should try moving forward as much as

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.190 
you should try moving forward as much as
Kevin<00:02:12.400> until<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.820> fall<00:02:13.060> off<00:02:13.270> then<00:02:14.020> you'll

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
jumping so now I'm going to have to look

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080 
jumping so now I'm going to have to look
forward<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.770> I'm<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.160> right<00:02:27.640> under<00:02:27.940> this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
forward so that I'm not right under this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.210
