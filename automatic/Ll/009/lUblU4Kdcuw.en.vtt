00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.230
 concerning rhythmic writing it's up to 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.740
 say the ones I just spoke to you about 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.629
 in writing concretely on a partition 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.210
 that denotes to that place after the 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.859
 key there you also called mind 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.199
 from here and there you have the writing 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.140
 rhythmic was the indication of rhythm 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.560
 announced a binary rhythm since my 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.130
 four is a multiple of 2 or so 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.329
 we have 2 4 1 or down while 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.220
 want to shoot 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.260
 what does he mean the first site says 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.559
 the number of notes we will have in a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.160
 measure and second indicates the duration of 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.770
 each note 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.870
 so the first case so told us 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.579
 so there are four notes and the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.710
 second 4 tells us that each of 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 these notes is a black so basically 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.609
 in every measure we will have a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.160
 equivalent not necessarily but we 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.929
 will have the equivalent of 4 black then you 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.079
 see who if we do not have blacks nahd 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.300
 and whites white but if you count 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.449
 good of white did four times gold 4 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.600
 black it's also four times so 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.920
 and he sees arriving at four times paf on 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.500
 has a bar of measures that tells us 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 that we change measurements then there is 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.160
 other types of writing there are by 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 example 3 4 so these three blacks in 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.470
 each measure so three times in 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.310
 every measure here is a movement 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.720
 ternary a movement of valls 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.900
 so these indications will help us 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.540
 in the next lessons to be determined 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.340
 the type of accompaniment among others 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.730
 that we can use for the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.130
 piece 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.090
 we also have ratings of this 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.150
 kind 3-2 so here it's 3 so three 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.390
 notes but the 2 voltage is over 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.660
 blacks these are whites so we have 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.070
 three blanket each measure so 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.110
 three whites kind 5 million it's 6 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 time by measure then we can have 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 also also notations 6.8 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.220
 with 1.6 above to 8 below the cid 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.470
 ten years that there is so if they note by 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.810
 measure but the 8 tells us that his 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.680
 notes hard so it's a half time this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.920
 are eighth notes 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
 we will see that in the game will be 3 6 8 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 so so crooked suicide half time it 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.310
 actually corresponds to three times then 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.990
 why noted 3 6 8 rather +34 since 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.290
 basically 3.4 it's three times 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.560
 by measure 6.8 so these are more of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.240
 philosophical type nuances 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 it tells us if the piece is more 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.670
 intense more rhythmic more joyous and that's 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.300
 then a way of telling us 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.100
 convenience 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.820
 I will use innovation very often 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.220
 in quarters 3 4 4 4 but this can happen 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.750
 that I use rossi am all but not 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.700
 you do not let this type of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.590
 notation is purely formal here 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.250
 it does not really interest them 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 to interest 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.890
 finally to spend time in the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.370
 kind of lesson that I propose maybe 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.320
 in a lesson but far more distant 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 I will tell you more about it but 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.940
 there it is useless for you to know 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.940
 the whole bottom of the thing
