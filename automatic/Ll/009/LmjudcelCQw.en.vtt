helps<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.689> support<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.230> lymphatic<00:00:22.680> system<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
helps to support the lymphatic system so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
helps to support the lymphatic system so

you can remove the stick and just use
the<00:00:38.010> brush<00:00:38.250> without<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> stick<00:00:39.320> sometimes<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the brush without the stick sometimes it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
the brush without the stick sometimes it
comes<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.010> stick<00:00:41.309> attached<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.940> then

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
comes with the stick attached so then

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
comes with the stick attached so then
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.750> use<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> stick<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:43.800> either

you can use it with the stick but either

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270 
you can use it with the stick but either
way<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> doesn't<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.760> matter<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> here's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
way it doesn't really matter so here's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700 
way it doesn't really matter so here's
the<00:00:47.460> routine<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.090> recommend<00:00:48.960> based<00:00:49.440> on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the routine that I recommend based on

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.279 
the routine that I recommend based on
what<00:00:50.219> supports<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> lymphatic<00:00:51.180> system<00:00:51.289> so

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
what supports the lymphatic system so

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.459 
what supports the lymphatic system so
I'm<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> without<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> stick<00:00:54.469> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
I'm going to use it without the stick so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.750

lymph node removal this is for a healthy
system<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.200> ideally<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> boost<00:01:53.429> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
system and it's ideally to boost the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
system and it's ideally to boost the
immune<00:01:53.820> system<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.289> just<00:01:55.560> start<00:01:55.860> at<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
immune system so you just start at the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.440 
immune system so you just start at the
sole<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.549> foot<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
sole of your foot you're not going to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.960 
sole of your foot you're not going to
see<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.080> video<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.729> then

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
see that in this video but you just then

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.990 
see that in this video but you just then
come<00:02:00.240> up<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.860> stroke<00:02:01.860> from<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.399> ankle<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
come up and stroke from your ankle to

to seven times covering the whole fine

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.740 
to seven times covering the whole fine
and<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.519> want<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> repeat<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
other side then as you get to the trunk

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.900 
other side then as you get to the trunk
aspect<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.500> body<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> come

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
aspect of the body you want to come

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.620 
aspect of the body you want to come
around<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.540> kind<00:02:24.540> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
around here but but and you go kind of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.880 
around here but but and you go kind of
like<00:02:24.780> you're<00:02:24.959> doing<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> little<00:02:25.290> dance<00:02:25.560> you're

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
like you're doing a little dance you're

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.070 
like you're doing a little dance you're
coming<00:02:26.160> around<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> front<00:02:27.000> because<00:02:27.900> your

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
coming around to the front because your

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.530 
coming around to the front because your
lymph<00:02:28.380> nodes<00:02:28.680> live<00:02:29.130> in<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> really

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
lymph nodes live in here so you really

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.180 
lymph nodes live in here so you really
want<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> lymph<00:02:31.290> flow<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:32.069> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
want to get the lymph flow going in that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.039 
want to get the lymph flow going in that
direction<00:02:33.110> then<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.440> come<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.830> your<00:02:34.950> abdomen

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
direction then you come to your abdomen

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.990 
direction then you come to your abdomen
hold<00:02:37.049> yourself<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:37.799> higher<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.820> go

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
hold yourself a little higher and you go

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.449 
hold yourself a little higher and you go
around<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.170> motion<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.890> digestive

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
around in the motion of the digestive

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.610 
around in the motion of the digestive
system<00:02:41.489> which<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.510> down<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.810> descending

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
system which is down the descending

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.789 
system which is down the descending
across<00:02:43.829> up<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> sending<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.019> across<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
across up the a sending and across the

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.050 
across up the a sending and across the
trevor<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> clock<00:02:49.910> Venice<00:02:50.910> is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
trevor so kind of like a clock Venice is

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
trevor so kind of like a clock Venice is
the<00:02:51.269> probably<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> part<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.579> most

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the probably the part that is the most

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.210 
the probably the part that is the most
important<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.359> my<00:02:54.510> opinion<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.140> that's<00:02:55.769> when

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
important in my opinion and that's when

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.069 
important in my opinion and that's when
you're<00:02:56.370> coming<00:02:56.700> from<00:02:56.850> your<00:02:57.120> hip<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.930> your

you're coming from your hip to your

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.370 
you're coming from your hip to your
armpit<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.519> is<00:02:59.700> a<00:03:00.049> closest<00:03:01.049> limp

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
armpit because this is a closest limp

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.949 
armpit because this is a closest limp
station<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.340> main<00:03:02.519> drain<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.630> want<00:03:03.870> to
