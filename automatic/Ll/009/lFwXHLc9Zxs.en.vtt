00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Long ago, in the distant year 2013, exactly on September 17 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.120
 we released GTA V on PS3 and Xbox 360. There was no end to the joy of the players. 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 Big world, cool heroes, beautiful graphics - a miracle, honey, peanuts. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.700
 People were running around Los Santos like a janitor, in the second and second. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.420
 Nobody could jump on us! Competition plowed. Reviews 97/100! 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.780
 Then we reheated the cutlet - GTA V on PS4 and Xbox One. 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.100
 But they are obscene - FPP mode, even better graphics, details, drawing ranges. Resistance well! 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.920
 Of course PC'towcy, fajujas without cash, just licked the title through the glass, because their version we did not. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.900
 But stick with them, hajs with consoles must agree. On YT movies from multi games to flush out a lot. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.860
 In order for the game to not get bored, we add new content, eg on the occasion of holidays, there was snow everywhere. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 And the computer people just hit the desk with anger. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.520
 "Bravo Rockstar, bravo" - write on the forums "give more on consoles, and overeat us!" 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600
 The time has come to silence them and let them play the game from last year and a half - we have set the premiere! 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.060
 We agreed that we will give the version even better than on PS4 and XOne on January 27, let them have it. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.540
 But you know what will we give away ?! 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.600
 We moved it two months later, on March 24! 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 PCs xD 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 PCs: D 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.420
 And a month before the premiere - again !! This time on ... April 14! 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.660
 Pecetowcy! 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.080
 Morons were ordered in November already ... 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.740
 Already through the eyes of the imagination they saw it together playing with colleagues ... 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 Omen even supposedly looked for people to the team. 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.900
 He would like to have such a team for multi as Rock assembled with Seto, Grabą and Yuuhim and what? 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.195
 And egg! 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.620
 Durny paź was already taking leave in February to make videos from GTA record, and now let him wait until Easter. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.060
 Under the news about the first postponement of the premiere - almost 5,700 comments. 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.780
 Pecetowcy! 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.220
 And to make the shit bigger, we have long talked about "Heist" 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.100
 or "robberies" in 4 people - consoles will get it on March 10, in a few days! 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.680
 Let the PCs still out of jealousy for one and a half months. 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.560
 After all, we can not do so that "Heist" will be released everywhere on the same day, huh? 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900
 Okay, seriousness. 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 We feel guilty about the situation ... 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.880
 that's why we will add free 300k of virtual cash to people with preorders (only 60 EURO on Steam) ... 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.520
 and to the plebs without hajsu we gave 11 new screenshots! 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.380
 Let them look at these details, these explosions, beautiful chiaroscuro. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.020
 They just need 11 pictures for 7 weeks of waiting, perfectly calculated. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.580
 Pecetowcy! 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.900
 And that it would be even better ... 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.740
 ...best... 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.940
 ... we've made so many billions that it's just as good ... 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300
 ... we can write for a month that we are moving the premiere! 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.260
 They will fire all over the internet, and we will calmly start doing this conversion ... 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.200
 because so far we are just drinking hajs from 4 consoles! 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.835
 You have not started yet ?! 

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:12.315
 Well, no, no!
