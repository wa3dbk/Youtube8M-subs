total eclipse on a sudden seen mainly
from<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> Arctic<00:00:16.410> regions<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.340> somewhere<00:00:17.640> in

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
from the Arctic regions so somewhere in

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.840 
from the Arctic regions so somewhere in
the<00:00:17.850> Arctic<00:00:18.180> Circle<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.750> Siberia<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.520> eclipse

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the Arctic Circle in Siberia the eclipse

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
the Arctic Circle in Siberia the eclipse
will<00:00:20.880> occur<00:00:21.000> at<00:00:21.330> midnight<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> Sun<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
will occur at midnight but the Sun is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.960 
will occur at midnight but the Sun is
still<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:22.949> horizon<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.640> time<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.850> year

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
still about horizon at this time of year

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.589 
still about horizon at this time of year
hence<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.170> midnight<00:00:25.920> eclipse<00:00:26.359> here<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
hence a midnight eclipse here is the

regions and see what's been going on we
should<00:00:51.899> talk<00:00:52.050> 24<00:00:52.230> seems<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> decaying<00:00:53.129> as

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
should talk 24 seems to be decaying as

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
should talk 24 seems to be decaying as
it<00:00:53.489> approaches<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> northwest<00:00:54.390> limb<00:00:54.600> but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it approaches the northwest limb but

it approaches the northwest limb but

behind this group of the number it is
yet<00:01:08.520> yeah<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.210> yet<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.659> sun<00:01:09.869> spots

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
yet yeah and we have yet more sun spots

yet yeah and we have yet more sun spots
coming<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> Northeast<00:01:10.890> limb<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.610> of

them is very large it's probably that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
them is very large it's probably that

the last few days region 12 26 has shown
some<00:01:18.420> interesting<00:01:18.840> developments<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
some interesting developments and the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
some interesting developments and the
sunspot<00:01:20.700> group<00:01:20.729> 12<00:01:21.150> 27<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> region<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> the

juice to see Flair that I talked about

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
juice to see Flair that I talked about
just<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.479> few<00:01:24.630> minutes<00:01:24.900> ago<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> perhaps<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just a few minutes ago now perhaps you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.800 
just a few minutes ago now perhaps you
can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> dilemma<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.479> trying<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
can see the dilemma of those trying to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
can see the dilemma of those trying to
use<00:01:27.930> sunspot<00:01:28.350> number<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> measure<00:01:28.920> solar

sunspot<00:01:34.260> count<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> sunspot<00:01:35.490> number

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
sunspot count so the sunspot number

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
sunspot count so the sunspot number
could<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.360> fifty<00:01:36.750> percent<00:01:37.100> which<00:01:38.100> does

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
could be out by fifty percent which does

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.860 
could be out by fifty percent which does
not<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.030> reliable<00:01:39.300> measure<00:01:39.690> of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
not make it a very reliable measure of

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.350 
not make it a very reliable measure of
solar<00:01:40.050> activity<00:01:40.370> further<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:42.000> sounds<00:01:42.240> what

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
solar activity further it sounds what

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
solar activity further it sounds what
number<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.660> increasing<00:01:42.780> yet<00:01:43.710> activity<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
number is increasing yet activity is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.210 
number is increasing yet activity is
dropping<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.170> even<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> number<00:01:46.800> was<00:01:46.890> right

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
dropping so even if the number was right

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
dropping so even if the number was right
it<00:01:47.760> wouldn't<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> very<00:01:48.270> good<00:01:48.480> indicator<00:01:49.310> now

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it wouldn't be a very good indicator now

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.500 
it wouldn't be a very good indicator now
let's<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> look<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> development<00:01:51.450> of

the magnetic movies these regions become

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.320 
the magnetic movies these regions become
more<00:02:36.630> diffuse<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.200> more<00:02:38.070> extended<00:02:38.489> as<00:02:39.090> time

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
more diffuse and more extended as time

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.990 
more diffuse and more extended as time
goes<00:02:39.570> by<00:02:39.600> that's<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> same<00:02:40.709> process<00:02:41.160> now

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
goes by that's the same process now

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.040 
goes by that's the same process now
let's<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.330> look<00:02:42.450> at<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> transition

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
let's take a look at the transition

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.449 
let's take a look at the transition
region<00:02:43.140> movie<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> see<00:02:43.890> what<00:02:44.040> eruptions

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
region movie and see what eruptions

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.310 
region movie and see what eruptions
there<00:02:44.580> have<00:02:44.670> been<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> Sun<00:02:45.230> because<00:02:46.230> he

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
there have been on the Sun because he

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.289 
there have been on the Sun because he
initially<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:47.370> another<00:02:47.640> part<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.000> snake

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
initially that another part of the snake

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.600 
initially that another part of the snake
lifts<00:02:48.660> off<00:02:48.780> I'll<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:49.980> surprised<00:02:50.340> if<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
lifts off I'll be very surprised if the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.920 
lifts off I'll be very surprised if the
rest<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.000> didn't<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.360> some<00:02:51.540> time<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.750> the

rest of it didn't at some time in the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.690 
rest of it didn't at some time in the
next<00:02:52.049> few<00:02:52.290> days<00:02:52.519> however<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.610> most

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
next few days however the most

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.280 
next few days however the most
interesting<00:02:54.150> eruption<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> southeast

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
interesting eruption is in the southeast

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:10.190 
interesting eruption is in the southeast
and<00:02:55.560> here's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.130> more<00:02:56.310> detailed<00:02:56.640> lluvia<00:02:56.970> back
