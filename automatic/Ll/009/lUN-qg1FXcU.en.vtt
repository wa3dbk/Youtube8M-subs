you find out and you try it out then you
you<00:02:13.379> see<00:02:13.590> how<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.800> use

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
you see how to use

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
you see how to use
you<00:02:14.459> know<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.849> takes<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.209> while<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.750> used<00:02:16.019> to

you know it takes a while to get used to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.920 
you know it takes a while to get used to
the<00:02:16.290> way<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.650> shoots<00:02:17.450> especially<00:02:18.450> from<00:02:18.660> long

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the way it shoots especially from long

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.490 
the way it shoots especially from long
distances<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.459> try<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.640> shoot<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.500> from

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
distances if you try to shoot that from

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.809 
distances if you try to shoot that from
far<00:02:22.739> away<00:02:22.769> you're<00:02:23.190> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.400> tend<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> notice

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
far away you're going to tend to notice

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.460 
far away you're going to tend to notice
that<00:02:24.150> sometimes<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.780> floats<00:02:25.019> up<00:02:25.260> and

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that sometimes it floats up and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770 
that sometimes it floats up and
sometimes<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.010> floats<00:02:26.250> down<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.239> depends

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
sometimes it floats down it just depends

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.050 
sometimes it floats down it just depends

aim it down from far away you want to
aim<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.739> downward<00:02:44.250> because<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.090> some<00:02:45.299> reason

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
aim it downward because for some reason

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.539

when<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.989> when<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.349> shoot<00:02:46.799> from<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.340> long

when you when you shoot from a long

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.270 
when you when you shoot from a long
distance<00:02:48.200> let's<00:02:49.200> say<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:49.590> across<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> map

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
distance let's say like across the map

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.640 
distance let's say like across the map
or<00:02:50.459> something<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.019> go<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.380> take

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
or something it is going to go and take

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.250 
or something it is going to go and take
off<00:02:52.890> into<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> air<00:02:53.670> more<00:02:54.090> upwards<00:02:54.690> than<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
off into the air more upwards than it is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.530 
off into the air more upwards than it is
downward<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> want<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.910> go<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.150> shoot<00:02:57.329> a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
downward so you want to go and shoot a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.539 
downward so you want to go and shoot a
little<00:02:57.690> bit<00:02:57.930> lower<00:02:58.230> than<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:59.519> normally

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
little bit lower than what you normally

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.759 
little bit lower than what you normally
would<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.450> you're<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.989> shoot<00:03:01.079> at<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> far

that<00:05:20.070> big<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.490> RPG<00:05:21.000> on<00:05:21.210> your<00:05:21.389> back<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:23.970> for

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
that big of RPG on your back but for

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.150 
that big of RPG on your back but for
sure<00:05:24.389> you<00:05:24.599> want<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.960> use<00:05:25.110> fast<00:05:25.500> hands<00:05:25.800> that's

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
sure you want to use fast hands that's

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.129 
sure you want to use fast hands that's
my<00:05:26.370> my<00:05:26.729> main<00:05:27.000> thing<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.539> think<00:05:27.750> that's<00:05:27.930> the

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
my my main thing is I think that's the

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.839 
my my main thing is I think that's the
one<00:05:28.320> perk<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:28.919> really<00:05:29.250> don't<00:05:29.460> want<00:05:29.729> to

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
one perk that you really don't want to

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.330 
one perk that you really don't want to
mess<00:05:30.539> with<00:05:30.570> because<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.229> mean<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.590> had<00:05:31.860> toughness

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
mess with because I mean I had toughness

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.310 
mess with because I mean I had toughness
on<00:05:32.490> this<00:05:32.820> one<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.240> there's<00:05:33.630> some<00:05:33.810> businesses

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
on this one and there's some businesses

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.189 
on this one and there's some businesses
was<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.710> when<00:05:34.889> i<00:05:34.919> wish<00:05:35.190> i<00:05:35.340> had<00:05:35.520> i<00:05:36.030> wish<00:05:36.870> i<00:05:36.990> had

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
was that when i wish i had i wish i had

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.909 
was that when i wish i had i wish i had
a<00:05:37.229> toughness<00:05:38.130> on<00:05:38.659> yeah<00:05:39.659> i<00:05:39.960> wish<00:05:40.199> i<00:05:40.289> had<00:05:40.409> the<00:05:40.440> the

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
a toughness on yeah i wish i had the the

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.980 
a toughness on yeah i wish i had the the
fast<00:05:41.190> hands<00:05:41.520> on<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:41.940> i<00:05:41.970> can<00:05:42.210> switch<00:05:42.449> out<00:05:42.630> really

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
fast hands on so i can switch out really

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.990 
fast hands on so i can switch out really
really<00:05:43.020> quickly<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.979> know<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.159> do<00:05:44.430> sacrifice

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
really quickly you know you do sacrifice

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.930 
really quickly you know you do sacrifice
that<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:46.380> note<00:05:46.830> that<00:05:47.130> less<00:05:47.370> flinching<00:05:47.909> when

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
that that note that less flinching when

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.330 
that that note that less flinching when
you<00:05:48.150> take<00:05:48.389> out<00:05:48.539> toughness<00:05:49.199> but<00:05:49.770> i<00:05:49.830> think<00:05:50.130> with

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
you take out toughness but i think with

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.010 
you take out toughness but i think with
your<00:05:50.520> using<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:50.970> RPG<00:05:51.479> you're<00:05:51.630> really<00:05:51.870> not

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
your using the RPG you're really not

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.950 
your using the RPG you're really not
going<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.349> need<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:53.460> be<00:05:53.669> able<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:54.060> avoid<00:05:54.419> a<00:05:54.479> shot

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
going to need to be able to avoid a shot
