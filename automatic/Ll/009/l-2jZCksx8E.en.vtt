00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.780
 with the national team against Romania only 20 minutes was in use 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.839
 He was happy to play Korkmaz right from the beginning and rightly so for the sixth time in his career 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.779
 so far from girl's title 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:15.019
 so far her remaining 90 minutes played through both teams 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.169
 incredibly important game the descent ghost is greetings from Deetz 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.679
 Frankfurt only four points in front of the relegation Korkmaz with many 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.749
 Liberties equipped left right he whirls there to start 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 deficient third on third place 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.579
 behind Paris do not blame openly 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 has not looked again added first this time a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.530
 Mutual cheerful knocking moments worth mentioning highlights runway minute 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.910
 before his work is much discussed is Emil Jula 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.330
 the duel against Benjamin Thym 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.800
 referee 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.880
 Ackermann has your dad is one meter 72 times it's her 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.110
 only one of over 40 thousand decision 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.300
 more than 20 pounds lighter 20 centimeters smaller 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.380
 RP it was fine 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.990
 a candle many Czechs Jagr rhetorical Huth Android 2 0 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.550
 maybe most important 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.990
 Herbert Ratz 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.760
 a double pack 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.760
 First leg in the fall accomplished the latter 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.300
 but chance they are so meet with the Bayern run us 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.289
 already in the fifth Stewart in Frankfurt 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.549
 probably his favorite opponent cold shower and the crew 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.630
 that could only win the last nine games - Korkmaz Köhler 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.390
 works Heinz Frey 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.140
 only four minutes after this penalty 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660
 and then this scene 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.360
 Vasilyevich the experts 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.420
 play in the shot of Köhler Rostock 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.620
 do not care 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.560
 not so easy to answer also three places 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 the referee again 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.799
 on the account 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.810
 Answer maybe a freezer 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.300
 the opportunity for compensation 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.620
 It was probably not natural Arndt Holtermann's hand posture 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 15 minutes later the equalizer 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 Louis Darmstadt 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 even now she mentions the book for the first time 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.399
 Fenin is struck and around 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.489
 that is and Fr 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.510
 for the Greeks coach of important political events quarter hour the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.839
 Playing time will probably not be quite commonplace 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.949
 Jackman's Dr like Red Bull 3 right 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.099
 Charell Abbas bought him a rented one 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.119
 good Gisin the austrian 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.869
 So the employee by law writes de opponent 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.139
 Leander Paes opponents have been made great on the good overview 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:47.079
 Korkmaz and a little later again the duo Korkmaz Meier on the other side of June 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.849
 are nimble drive strongly anticipated belt Korkmaz 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.899
 he is perhaps the same now for the World Cup Meyer 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.589
 so far too much pain 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 the big chance 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 SCR well seen from with Korkmaz 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.129
 strong game in half one that has also seen the topics 15% is there 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.510
 maybe today's first 90 minutes use of Opel immediately after the 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:15.010
 pause 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.959
 Frankfurt free kick Markus Steinhöfer TRIPLAN distance 35 meters in front of the goal 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.589
 you get into the penalty area but dangerous 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.979
 after two to one 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.979
 currently is 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.849
 Be content with excesses 1 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.419
 a torgarant symptomatic of this procedure 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.369
 played in the visor 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:43.369
 Third goal of the season for Steinhöfer 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.789
 last OK 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.919
 won three times 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.309
 today it looks again 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.759
 Similarly, companies are not very happy about that 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.789
 Compensation after the leading goal Russia 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.999
 from the place for him Cairo arrives 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.519
 Percent of his duels won 15 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.989
 of 16 seats to land 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.999
 So very great values ​​led by Peter from the place therefore it is quite 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.339
 bad explains Schmidt representative of this scene here Frankfurt 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.099
 the US prevailed 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.400
 in dissolution because it hapert's really front and rear ago ultimately failed and 

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:24.249
 in injury time world looks really dangerous scoring opportunity after the 2 2 1 2 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.249
 1 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.229
 at 2 2 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.590
 off the 19th 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.930
 he is Brazilian only aluminum system 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.930
 the fifth defeat in series 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.839
 another step towards the intermediate round
