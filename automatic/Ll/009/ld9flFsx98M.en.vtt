Matsumoto Castle which is quite a
spectacular<00:06:10.320> place<00:06:11.570> so<00:06:12.570> and<00:06:13.050> again<00:06:13.590> close<00:06:13.980> to

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
ski fields by bus for the day if you

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.680 
ski fields by bus for the day if you
want<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.730> then<00:06:17.850> come<00:06:18.000> back<00:06:18.030> to<00:06:18.180> here<00:06:18.480> which

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
want to and then come back to here which

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.300 
want to and then come back to here which
is<00:06:18.720> actually<00:06:18.990> not<00:06:19.290> a<00:06:19.320> bad<00:06:19.500> option<00:06:19.710> because

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
is actually not a bad option because

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.610 
is actually not a bad option because
staying<00:06:20.910> up<00:06:21.120> closer<00:06:21.510> to<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.780> ski<00:06:22.110> fields<00:06:22.470> and

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
staying up closer to the ski fields and

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.670 
staying up closer to the ski fields and
this<00:06:22.770> gets<00:06:23.010> really<00:06:23.100> really<00:06:23.670> expensive<00:06:24.680> so

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
this gets really really expensive so

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.970 
this gets really really expensive so
it's<00:06:25.800> a<00:06:25.890> pretty<00:06:26.100> reasonable<00:06:26.480> option<00:06:27.980> as

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
it's a pretty reasonable option as

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.620 
it's a pretty reasonable option as
you'll<00:06:29.310> find<00:06:29.340> out<00:06:29.670> yourselves<00:06:30.240> if<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.450> do<00:06:30.570> a

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
you'll find out yourselves if you do a

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.810 
you'll find out yourselves if you do a
