going to get something that looks good
so<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:37.970> guy<00:01:38.240> let's<00:01:38.960> see<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.350> haven't<00:01:39.979> got

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
so for this guy let's see I haven't got

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.710 
so for this guy let's see I haven't got
too<00:01:40.369> many<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.729> accessories<00:01:41.090> out<00:01:41.360> anyway

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
too many of the accessories out anyway

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.600 
too many of the accessories out anyway
but<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:41.990> mean<00:01:42.200> as<00:01:42.319> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:43.310> I've<00:01:43.429> done

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
but I mean as you can see what I've done

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.749 
but I mean as you can see what I've done
over<00:01:43.789> here<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.479> I've<00:01:44.960> used<00:01:45.319> a<00:01:45.590> two-tone<00:01:46.280> blue

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
over here is I've used a two-tone blue

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.779 
over here is I've used a two-tone blue
so<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.929> think<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.410> shows<00:01:48.679> up<00:01:49.009> best<00:01:49.369> over<00:01:49.580> here<00:01:49.759> I

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
so I think it shows up best over here I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.070 
so I think it shows up best over here I
hope<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.149> camera<00:01:50.450> picks<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.750> up<00:01:50.810> but

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
hope the camera picks it up but

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.770 
hope the camera picks it up but
basically<00:01:51.830> i<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.340> used<00:01:52.580> two<00:01:53.030> colors<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.630> blue

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
basically i have used two colors of blue

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.510 
basically i have used two colors of blue
so<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.860> difference<00:01:55.130> over<00:01:55.280> there

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so you can see the difference over there

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.290 
so you can see the difference over there
with<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.759> shoulder<00:01:56.360> joints<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.179> a

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
with the shoulder joints and it's it's a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.669 
with the shoulder joints and it's it's a
bit<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.660> mix<00:01:59.899> i<00:02:00.050> mean<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.289> for<00:02:00.619> example

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
bit of a mix i mean like for example

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.040 
bit of a mix i mean like for example
even<00:02:01.039> on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.310> funnels<00:02:01.670> here<00:02:01.910> i've<00:02:02.360> got<00:02:02.479> two

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
even on the funnels here i've got two

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.570 
even on the funnels here i've got two
colors<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.590> same<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:03.950> blue<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.160> then<00:02:04.429> this

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
colors the same of blue and then this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.059 
colors the same of blue and then this
one<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.910> little<00:02:05.000> bit<00:02:05.300> different<00:02:05.890> even<00:02:06.890> over

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
one is a little bit different even over

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.790 
one is a little bit different even over
here<00:02:07.310> these<00:02:07.789> parts<00:02:08.330> are<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.990> same<00:02:09.259> but<00:02:09.500> this

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
here these parts are the same but this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.980 
here these parts are the same but this
one<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> little<00:02:10.220> bit<00:02:10.490> darker<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.510> know<00:02:11.600> so

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
one is a little bit darker you know so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.449 
one is a little bit darker you know so
this<00:02:12.350> was<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> first<00:02:12.770> time<00:02:12.890> i<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.100> getting<00:02:13.370> a

was the first kid where I actually

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.540 
was the first kid where I actually
started<00:05:25.570> doing<00:05:25.800> decal<00:05:26.800> transfers<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:27.340> I'm<00:05:27.400> so

and<00:05:32.230> in<00:05:33.190> my<00:05:33.310> opinion<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:34.120> should<00:05:34.150> probably<00:05:34.570> do

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
and in my opinion you should probably do

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.300 
and in my opinion you should probably do
the<00:05:34.900> waterslide<00:05:35.380> decals<00:05:35.770> because<00:05:36.010> once<00:05:36.190> you

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
the waterslide decals because once you

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.550 
the waterslide decals because once you
do<00:05:36.430> them<00:05:36.670> properly<00:05:36.880> it's<00:05:37.690> almost<00:05:38.020> like

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
do them properly it's almost like

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.020 
do them properly it's almost like
they've<00:05:38.800> been<00:05:38.920> painted<00:05:39.340> on<00:05:39.460> which<00:05:39.730> is<00:05:39.880> the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
they've been painted on which is the

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.780 
they've been painted on which is the
exact<00:05:40.390> effect<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:40.960> want<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.260> go<00:05:41.380> for

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
exact effect that you want to go for

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.340 
exact effect that you want to go for
okay<00:05:42.790> now<00:05:43.090> just<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.600> give<00:05:43.720> you<00:05:43.810> an<00:05:43.900> idea<00:05:44.050> on

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
okay now just to give you an idea on

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.260 
okay now just to give you an idea on
size<00:05:45.130> comparisons<00:05:45.790> because<00:05:45.850> this<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.240> a

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
size comparisons because this is a

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.770 
size comparisons because this is a
pretty<00:05:46.540> big<00:05:46.720> kit<00:05:46.990> it's<00:05:47.620> not<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.860> normal<00:05:48.070> size<00:05:48.430> I

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
pretty big kit it's not a normal size I

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.330 
pretty big kit it's not a normal size I
here<00:05:49.780> he<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.200> next<00:05:50.530> to<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.740> master<00:05:51.130> grade

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
here he is next to the master grade

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
something which is a little bit more

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.280 
something which is a little bit more
recent<00:06:12.190> which<00:06:13.180> is<00:06:13.330> a<00:06:13.360> match<00:06:13.600> grade<00:06:13.870> Delta<00:06:14.140> plus

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
now he is shorter than the Delta plus or

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.030 
now he is shorter than the Delta plus or
are<00:06:17.980> you<00:06:18.100> falling<00:06:18.310> over<00:06:18.990> Larry<00:06:19.990> oh<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.680> he<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:21.010> a

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
are you falling over Larry oh so he is a

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
little bit shorter than the Delta plus I

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.360 
little bit shorter than the Delta plus I
mean<00:06:23.140> I<00:06:23.230> probably<00:06:23.590> say<00:06:23.920> about<00:06:23.950> half<00:06:24.280> a

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
mean I probably say about half a

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.370 
mean I probably say about half a
centimeter<00:06:24.550> but<00:06:25.480> if<00:06:25.780> you<00:06:25.900> look<00:06:26.020> at<00:06:26.170> the

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
centimeter but if you look at the

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.620 
centimeter but if you look at the
overall<00:06:26.560> kit<00:06:27.160> size<00:06:27.460> they're<00:06:27.790> almost<00:06:28.060> exactly

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
overall kit size they're almost exactly

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.450 
overall kit size they're almost exactly
the<00:06:28.720> same<00:06:28.810> and<00:06:29.170> to<00:06:29.740> think<00:06:29.890> that<00:06:30.010> this<00:06:30.220> guy<00:06:30.400> came
