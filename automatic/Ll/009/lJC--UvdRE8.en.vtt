closer you should probably consider the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.780 
closer you should probably consider the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
higher frequency pair if you're looking

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.580

for<00:00:39.910> longer<00:00:40.270> range<00:00:40.390> detection<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.380> should

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
for longer range detection you should

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.140 
for longer range detection you should
probably<00:00:41.770> consider<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.490> lower<00:00:42.640> frequency

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
probably consider the lower frequency
