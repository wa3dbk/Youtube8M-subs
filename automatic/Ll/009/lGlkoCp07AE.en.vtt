time<00:00:36.960> I've<00:00:37.110> used<00:00:37.380> Bridgers<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.610> thing<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
time I've used Bridgers one thing I

time I've used Bridgers one thing I
noticed<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:39.719> traps<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:41.370> to

noticed with these traps is I want to
set<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> trap<00:00:42.260> right<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.789> have

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
set the trap right up in here they have

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.040 
set the trap right up in here they have
such<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> Canadian<00:00:45.989> Bend<00:00:46.289> him<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.770> actually

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
such a Canadian Bend him is actually

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
such a Canadian Bend him is actually
before<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.320> could<00:00:49.500> even<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.070> set<00:00:50.489> these

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
before I could even get it set these

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.029 
before I could even get it set these
were<00:00:51.050> contacting<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.890> actually

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
were contacting here and I was actually

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
were contacting here and I was actually
bending<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.940> frame<00:00:54.329> squeezing<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> frames

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bending the frame squeezing the frames

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.430 
bending the frame squeezing the frames
in<00:00:56.550> order<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.270> set<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.960> puts<00:00:58.260> too

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
in order to get it set that puts too

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
in order to get it set that puts too
much<00:00:58.469> pressure<00:00:58.680> on<00:01:00.379> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.620> trigger<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.910> lay

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
much pressure on on the trigger so I lay

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
much pressure on on the trigger so I lay
them<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.309> strike<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.970> here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
them down I strike them here and here

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750 
them down I strike them here and here
and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:07.380> not<00:01:07.530> trigger<00:01:07.920> set<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> want<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and I will not trigger set I want a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
and I will not trigger set I want a
slight<00:01:09.030> space<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.830> sides<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.640> of

slight space on the sides and all of
them<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> frame<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.020> be

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
them I don't want the frame to be

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.880 
them I don't want the frame to be
connecting<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> straining<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:15.689> trigger<00:01:16.020> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
connecting and straining my trigger do

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
connecting and straining my trigger do
you<00:01:17.009> notice<00:01:17.400> even<00:01:17.580> though<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> heavy

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you notice even though this is a heavy

you notice even though this is a heavy
trigger<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:21.020> took<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.470> trap<00:01:22.860> there

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
trigger on here I took that trap there

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 
trigger on here I took that trap there
shouldn't<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.580> any<00:01:23.790> wobble<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
shouldn't be any wobble in there you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469 
shouldn't be any wobble in there you
know<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:26.009> should<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.670> able<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> flip<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.270> without

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
know I should be able to flip it without

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.620 
know I should be able to flip it without
that<00:01:27.780> without<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.979> trigger<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.670> out

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that without that trigger going out

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.670 
that without that trigger going out
there<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> wobbling<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:31.890> trigger<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there is wobbling your trigger and the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.910 
there is wobbling your trigger and the
way<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> correct<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:39.680> reason<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.829> would

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
way you correct that reason there would

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
way you correct that reason there would
be<00:01:40.979> wobble<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:44.509> your<00:01:45.509> flat<00:01:45.960> points<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.990> either

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
be wobble is your flat points on either

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.530 
be wobble is your flat points on either
side<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.880> flat<00:01:51.149> point

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
side right here you get this flat point

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620 
side right here you get this flat point
makes<00:01:52.259> contact<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
makes contact down here and on the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.730 
makes contact down here and on the
backside<00:01:55.200> ya<00:01:56.210> know<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.930> wobble<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
backside ya know if there's wobble and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
backside ya know if there's wobble and
what's<00:01:59.009> happening<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> your<00:02:02.509> your

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
what's happening is the top of your your

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.540 
what's happening is the top of your your
own<00:02:04.070> groove<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.759> hitting<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> frame

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
own groove here is hitting the frame

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
own groove here is hitting the frame
before<00:02:08.629> these<00:02:09.629> flat<00:02:09.959> surfaces<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.770> coming

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
before these flat surfaces are coming

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
before these flat surfaces are coming
into<00:02:11.129> contact<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.030> got<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.599> space

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
into contact so you got a little space

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.309 
into contact so you got a little space
front<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.709> back<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:15.000> trigger<00:02:15.420> will

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
front and back and that trigger will

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.580 
front and back and that trigger will
wobble<00:02:17.310> back<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.790> forth<00:02:18.090> until<00:02:18.629> go<00:02:18.959> until<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
wobble back and forth until go until it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.399 
wobble back and forth until go until it
makes<00:02:19.709> contact<00:02:19.829> on<00:02:20.610> either<00:02:20.760> side<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.140> what<00:02:22.319> you

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
makes contact on either side so what you

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.679 
makes contact on either side so what you
need<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:24.000> groove<00:02:24.360> out

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
need to do is is take that groove out

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.160 
need to do is is take that groove out
enough<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:26.120> those<00:02:27.120> flat<00:02:27.420> surfaces<00:02:27.989> are

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
enough so that those flat surfaces are

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.550 
enough so that those flat surfaces are
making<00:02:28.560> contact<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.780> front<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.409> you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
making contact in the front there you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.190 
making contact in the front there you
see<00:02:35.299> this<00:02:36.299> flat<00:02:36.599> surface<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.099> here<00:02:39.140> has<00:02:40.140> to

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
see this flat surface up in here has to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.979 
see this flat surface up in here has to
be<00:02:40.319> right<00:02:40.590> against<00:02:41.099> there<00:02:41.510> there's<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.629> space

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
be right against there there's a space

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.430 
be right against there there's a space
to<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> wobble<00:02:45.109> so<00:02:46.109> that's<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:46.379> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
to go to wobble so that's how you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.089 
to go to wobble so that's how you
correct<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.099> now<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.120> got<00:02:48.390> these<00:02:48.629> set<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.140> with

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
correct that now I got these set up with

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.500 
correct that now I got these set up with
my<00:02:50.310> own<00:02:50.489> style<00:02:52.040> trigger<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.340> them<00:02:53.519> this<00:02:54.450> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
my own style trigger on them this is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.440 
my own style trigger on them this is
what<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:54.989> call<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.590> species<00:02:56.239> trigger<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:58.440> mink

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
what I call all species trigger it mink

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.940 
what I call all species trigger it mink
there's<00:03:00.450> no<00:03:00.629> place<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.139> mink<00:03:01.409> really<00:03:01.769> can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
there's no place a mink really can

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.059 
there's no place a mink really can
squeeze<00:03:02.250> through<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:02.700> or<00:03:03.450> down<00:03:03.629> here<00:03:04.069> it's

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
squeeze through here or down here it's

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.330 
squeeze through here or down here it's
pretty<00:03:05.370> tight<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:06.290> even<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.470> he<00:03:07.620> does<00:03:07.889> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
pretty tight in there even if he does I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.190 
pretty tight in there even if he does I
got<00:03:08.879> set<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.480> four-way<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:11.480> good<00:03:12.480> again<00:03:12.780> I

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.780 

really<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:16.889> this<00:03:17.069> last<00:03:17.400> year

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
really like this I use this last year

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.860 
really like this I use this last year
and<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.090> caught<00:03:18.359> me<00:03:18.660> muskrat<00:03:19.379> otter<00:03:19.709> beaver<00:03:20.870> in

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and I caught me muskrat otter beaver in

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.379 
and I caught me muskrat otter beaver in
order<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.620> trigger<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.190> work<00:03:23.400> as<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
order for this trigger to work as a

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.539 
order for this trigger to work as a
four-way<00:03:25.019> meaning<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:25.980> pushed<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
four-way meaning if it's pushed to the

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.509 
four-way meaning if it's pushed to the
side<00:03:26.849> it's<00:03:27.329> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.599> fire<00:03:27.930> your<00:03:28.199> trap<00:03:28.530> be

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
side it's going to fire your trap be

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.280 
side it's going to fire your trap be
sure<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:30.120> when<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.629> wobbles<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:33.599> high<00:03:33.810> point

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
sure that when it wobbles the high point

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.729 
sure that when it wobbles the high point
here<00:03:35.329> reaches<00:03:36.329> at<00:03:36.510> least<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.500> halfway

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
here reaches at least to the halfway

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.869 
here reaches at least to the halfway
point<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:39.150> frame<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.780> neither<00:03:40.620> side<00:03:41.010> so

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
point on your frame I neither side so

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.259 
point on your frame I neither side so
you<00:03:41.940> might<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.359> required<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.949> put<00:03:43.949> a<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:45.180> know

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
you might be required to put a you know

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.050 
you might be required to put a you know
like<00:03:45.720> something<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.829> here<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.609> file

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
like something up in here like a file

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.420 
like something up in here like a file
I'll<00:03:48.329> bang<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.780> file<00:03:49.079> up<00:03:49.349> in<00:03:49.560> there<00:03:49.829> on<00:03:50.040> both

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
I'll bang a file up in there on both

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.059 
I'll bang a file up in there on both
sides<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.120> then<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:52.199> on<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.500> top<00:03:52.709> side

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
sides and then and then on the top side

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.069 
sides and then and then on the top side
here<00:03:53.489> put<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:53.879> in<00:03:53.970> there<00:03:54.209> bang<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.660> up<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.900> there

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
here put it in there bang it up in there

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.050 
here put it in there bang it up in there
try<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.410> stretch<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.889> out<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.280> again<00:03:56.519> so

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
try and stretch it out so again so

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
try and stretch it out so again so
that's<00:03:57.239> reaching<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.780> halfway<00:03:57.989> point<00:03:58.290> it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
that's reaching the halfway point it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.509 
that's reaching the halfway point it
might<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.430> fire<00:04:00.260> yet<00:04:01.260> because<00:04:01.739> God<00:04:02.069> do<00:04:02.280> one

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
might not fire yet because God do one

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.399 
might not fire yet because God do one
more<00:04:02.760> step<00:04:03.000> which<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.269> next<00:04:03.720> step<00:04:03.989> I'll<00:04:04.199> show

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
more step which is next step I'll show

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.210 
more step which is next step I'll show
you<00:04:04.470> what<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.400> get<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:05.909> got<00:04:06.090> no<00:04:06.510> wobble

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
you what you get so you got no wobble

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.839 
you what you get so you got no wobble
then<00:04:08.419> the<00:04:09.419> next<00:04:09.720> step<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.470> adjust<00:04:10.709> where<00:04:11.669> it

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
then the next step is to adjust where it

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.879 
then the next step is to adjust where it
fires<00:04:12.349> now<00:04:13.849> the<00:04:14.849> part<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.870> this<00:04:16.139> trigger<00:04:16.680> that

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
fires now the part of this trigger that

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.069 
fires now the part of this trigger that
that<00:04:17.310> holds<00:04:17.909> this<00:04:18.870> trap<00:04:19.260> set<00:04:20.039> is<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.630> front

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
that holds this trap set is the front

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.500 
that holds this trap set is the front
part<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.889> here<00:04:23.159> groove<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:24.090> front<00:04:24.389> of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
part of this here groove in front of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.890 
part of this here groove in front of
this<00:04:24.630> groove

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
this groove

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.870 
this groove
here<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.440> what<00:04:27.810> holds<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.560> back<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.669> back

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
here is what holds this back the back

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.540 
here is what holds this back the back
side<00:04:31.180> has<00:04:31.389> moved<00:04:31.660> on<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.930> nothing<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:33.250> front

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
side has moved on to nothing the front

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.909 
side has moved on to nothing the front
side<00:04:33.790> that<00:04:34.060> makes<00:04:34.330> contact<00:04:34.960> here<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.530> holds

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
side that makes contact here and holds

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.409 
side that makes contact here and holds
that<00:04:36.100> from<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:37.210> forward<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.590> so<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:40.210> your

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
that from going forward and so if your

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.610 
that from going forward and so if your
trigger<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.810> going<00:04:41.110> way<00:04:41.410> out<00:04:41.440> before<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.699> fires

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
trigger is going way out before it fires

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.879 
trigger is going way out before it fires
then<00:04:44.620> what<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.550> do<00:04:45.729> is<00:04:46.449> you<00:04:46.630> make<00:04:46.889> 45-degree

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
then what you do is you make 45-degree

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.189 
then what you do is you make 45-degree
angle<00:04:48.340> right<00:04:48.520> here<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:49.000> fact<00:04:49.270> you're<00:04:49.930> going<00:04:50.110> to

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
angle right here in fact you're going to

slip off now if you go too much it won't
hold<00:06:38.070> the<00:06:38.280> trap<00:06:38.550> set<00:06:38.940> so<00:06:39.240> we<00:06:39.330> do<00:06:39.450> a<00:06:39.479> little<00:06:39.690> at<00:06:39.870> a

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
hold the trap set so we do a little at a

hold the trap set so we do a little at a

time if you end up doing too much when
you're<00:06:43.050> gonna<00:06:43.169> have<00:06:43.320> to<00:06:43.500> flatten<00:06:43.889> it<00:06:43.950> out

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
you're gonna have to flatten it out

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.140 
you're gonna have to flatten it out
again<00:06:45.200> get<00:06:46.200> off<00:06:46.410> a<00:06:46.740> lot<00:06:47.220> of<00:06:47.250> your<00:06:47.340> groove<00:06:47.700> and

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
again get off a lot of your groove and

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.540 
again get off a lot of your groove and
then<00:06:48.630> start<00:06:48.990> again<00:06:49.139> I'm<00:06:49.530> getting<00:06:50.039> the<00:06:50.130> proper

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
then start again I'm getting the proper

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.310 
then start again I'm getting the proper
angle<00:06:51.500> and<00:06:52.500> that's<00:06:52.620> how<00:06:52.860> you<00:06:52.919> get<00:06:53.910> a<00:06:54.080> trap<00:06:55.080> all

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
angle and that's how you get a trap all

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.440 
angle and that's how you get a trap all
tuned<00:06:55.680> up<00:06:55.919> so<00:06:56.639> that<00:06:56.820> you're<00:06:56.970> catching<00:06:57.180> the
