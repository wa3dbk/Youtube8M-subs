rougher<00:01:17.689> CI<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> believe<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.130> have

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
rougher CI one I believe it is I have

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.350 
rougher CI one I believe it is I have
the<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.790> piers<00:01:21.119> yes<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.780> won

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.070 

so<00:01:26.510> see<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.690> square<00:01:29.210> carbide<00:01:30.210> insert<00:01:30.840> there

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
so see the square carbide insert there

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.080 
so see the square carbide insert there
hold<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.410> with<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> screw<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:33.080> nice<00:01:34.080> maple<00:01:34.410> handle

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
hold on with a screw a nice maple handle

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
hold on with a screw a nice maple handle
with<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.660> double<00:01:37.020> end<00:01:37.620> on<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
with kind of like the double end on and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
with kind of like the double end on and
I<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.450> pendant<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.840> grip<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I guess you can pendant you can grip it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
I guess you can pendant you can grip it
like<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
like right here but if you really have a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.150 
like right here but if you really have a
heavy<00:01:41.910> cut<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> grip<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.290> so

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
heavy cut you can grip it back here so

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.890 
heavy cut you can grip it back here so
you<00:01:44.190> get<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.430> lot<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> leverage<00:01:45.150> if<00:01:45.750> you're

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
you get a lot of leverage if you're

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.200 
you get a lot of leverage if you're
roughing<00:01:46.260> something<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.830> good<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:48.090> got

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
roughing something pretty good it's got

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.010 
roughing something pretty good it's got
a<00:01:48.240> nice<00:01:48.450> square<00:01:49.790> bar<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.570> sits<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
a nice square bar here so it sits on the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.720 
a nice square bar here so it sits on the
tool<00:01:52.200> rest<00:01:52.440> flat<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.980> really<00:01:53.250> easy<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> cup

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
tool rest flat it's really easy to cup

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.340 
tool rest flat it's really easy to cup
to<00:01:54.030> learn<00:01:54.180> how<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.360> cut<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> doesn't

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
to learn how to cut with it it doesn't

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
to learn how to cut with it it doesn't
cut<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.830> clean<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:57.330> end<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.720> this

cut all that clean now the end on this

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.410 
cut all that clean now the end on this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
about this is that the tips through

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.710 
about this is that the tips through
these<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.040> 10<00:02:05.790> 50<00:02:06.150> bucks<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:06.690> is

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
these are like 10 50 bucks which is

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.930 
these are like 10 50 bucks which is
ridiculous<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.100> know<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.820> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
ridiculous I think you know it's just a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.050 
ridiculous I think you know it's just a
piece<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> metal<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> semi<00:02:11.400> sharp<00:02:11.670> edge<00:02:11.850> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
piece of metal the semi sharp edge you

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
piece of metal the semi sharp edge you
know<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> carbide<00:02:12.810> doesn't<00:02:13.140> take<00:02:13.230> an<00:02:13.380> edge

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
know the carbide doesn't take an edge

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
know the carbide doesn't take an edge
quite<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.190> steel<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.870> much

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
quite as nice as steel and it's much

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.070 
quite as nice as steel and it's much
harder<00:02:16.290> though<00:02:17.570> but<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.600> can<00:02:18.840> buy<00:02:19.020> these

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
harder though but you can buy these

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.830 
harder though but you can buy these

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
different sizes and I believe that size

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.400 
different sizes and I believe that size
on<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.180> fifteen<00:02:39.720> millimeters<00:02:40.260> by

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
on this is like fifteen millimeters by

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.340 
on this is like fifteen millimeters by
15<00:02:40.769> millimeters<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.600> it's<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.780> they<00:02:43.170> make

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
15 millimeters and it's like they make

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.190 
15 millimeters and it's like they make
them<00:02:43.530> square<00:02:44.459> across<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
them square across and this one is the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.780 
them square across and this one is the
slightly<00:02:46.500> rounded<00:02:47.070> one<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:47.550> get<00:02:47.670> them

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
slightly rounded one you can get them

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.990 
slightly rounded one you can get them
all<00:02:47.910> from<00:02:48.120> them<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.900> think<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.530> I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
all from them and I think it's like I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.009 
all from them and I think it's like I
want<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.030> say<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.300> two<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> half

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
want to say it two and a half

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.259 
want to say it two and a half
millimeters<00:02:52.290> thick<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.670> calipers<00:02:54.180> I

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
millimeters thick I have a calipers I

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.180 
millimeters thick I have a calipers I
can<00:02:54.450> check<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:54.930> oh<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.410> might<00:02:55.709> update<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
can check it then oh I might update that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.090 
can check it then oh I might update that
in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> comments<00:02:57.000> or<00:02:57.120> something<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:59.040> that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
in the comments or something that's that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.820 
in the comments or something that's that
tool<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.489> mean<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.850> expensive<00:03:00.650> for<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:01.800> it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
tool I mean it is expensive for what it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.990 
tool I mean it is expensive for what it
is<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.570> made<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.660> America<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.880> guess<00:03:05.880> that's

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is but made in America so I guess that's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.080 
is but made in America so I guess that's
all<00:03:06.180> right<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.980> here's<00:03:08.310> some<00:03:08.489> tools<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.940> are

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
all right now here's some tools that are

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.790 
all right now here's some tools that are
very<00:03:09.769> nice<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.610> made<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:11.910> America

an edge underneath the vessel Oh
and<00:03:30.380> that's<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.590> 60<00:03:32.040> bucks<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> metal

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
and that's like 60 bucks for the metal

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.320 
and that's like 60 bucks for the metal
part<00:03:33.630> here<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.230> steel<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.880> made<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
part here for the steel and I made the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.150 
part here for the steel and I made the
handle<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:37.020> kind<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.770> copied<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:39.800> easy<00:03:40.800> wood

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
handle I kind of copied the easy wood

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.980 
handle I kind of copied the easy wood
tool<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.390> made<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.960> a

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
tool there and I made this out a

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.980 
tool there and I made this out a
bloodwood<00:03:44.040> which<00:03:44.460> is<00:03:44.880> very<00:03:45.180> hard<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.750> dense

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
bloodwood which is very hard and dense

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.680 
bloodwood which is very hard and dense
tropical<00:03:46.950> wood<00:03:47.460> so<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.880> adds<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.180> lot<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.360> heft

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
tropical wood so it adds a lot of heft

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.270 
tropical wood so it adds a lot of heft
to<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> handle<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:49.500> my<00:03:50.010> largest<00:03:50.310> tool<00:03:50.780> by

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
to the handle it's my largest tool by

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.760 
to the handle it's my largest tool by
now<00:03:53.280> I'd<00:03:53.490> say<00:03:53.760> maybe<00:03:54.560> two<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:55.740> three<00:03:55.770> inches

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
now I'd say maybe two or three inches

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.960 
now I'd say maybe two or three inches
next<00:03:58.770> one<00:03:58.980> here<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.750> Sorby<00:04:01.370> another<00:04:02.370> tool

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
next one here is the Sorby another tool

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.330 
next one here is the Sorby another tool
I<00:04:03.000> bought<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.420> got<00:04:04.260> these<00:04:04.440> at<00:04:04.680> wood<00:04:04.800> craft<00:04:05.100> these

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
I bought I got these at wood craft these

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490

all these British tools actually I'll do
rougher<00:04:08.070> too<00:04:08.360> but<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.450> buy<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.810> deal<00:04:10.020> it's<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
rougher too but you buy this deal it's a

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.080 
rougher too but you buy this deal it's a
lot<00:04:10.410> cheaper<00:04:10.440> because<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.400> handle<00:04:11.700> Sorby

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
lot cheaper because the handle Sorby

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.670 
lot cheaper because the handle Sorby
makes<00:04:12.330> apparently<00:04:12.780> adds<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.200> 30<00:04:13.470> or<00:04:13.650> 40

bucks to the price of the tool you can
just<00:04:16.320> buy<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.500> metal<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.150> turn<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.299> own

couple of tips that go in the end there

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.580 
couple of tips that go in the end there
and<00:04:28.260> use<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.730> hauling<00:04:30.450> small<00:04:31.110> vessels

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590

finger<00:05:30.809> now<00:05:30.959> this<00:05:31.139> one<00:05:31.259> was<00:05:31.349> thirty<00:05:31.619> bucks

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
finger now this one was thirty bucks

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.759 
finger now this one was thirty bucks
made<00:05:32.549> my<00:05:32.759> own<00:05:32.789> handle<00:05:33.299> now<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:34.469> had<00:05:34.739> some

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:34.769 
made my own handle now I had some

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.879 
made my own handle now I had some
spindles<00:05:35.729> from<00:05:36.629> a<00:05:36.659> sale<00:05:37.079> or<00:05:37.319> some<00:05:37.499> other<00:05:37.649> wood

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
spindles from a sale or some other wood

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.419 
spindles from a sale or some other wood
I<00:05:37.919> had<00:05:38.129> found<00:05:38.399> and<00:05:39.379> the<00:05:40.379> spindle<00:05:40.859> when<00:05:41.159> it<00:05:41.309> was

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:41.429 
I had found and the spindle when it was

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:43.819 
I had found and the spindle when it was
sold<00:05:41.729> and<00:05:42.419> everything<00:05:42.839> on<00:05:42.959> the<00:05:43.079> lathe<00:05:43.259> turning

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:43.829 
sold and everything on the lathe turning

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:46.819 
sold and everything on the lathe turning
between<00:05:44.189> centers<00:05:45.109> it<00:05:46.109> was<00:05:46.229> a<00:05:46.259> little<00:05:46.529> small

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:46.829 
between centers it was a little small

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:48.729 
between centers it was a little small
for<00:05:47.069> a<00:05:47.099> handle<00:05:47.369> by<00:05:47.519> itself<00:05:47.849> so<00:05:48.089> I<00:05:48.119> took<00:05:48.209> some

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:48.739 
for a handle by itself so I took some

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:52.159 
for a handle by itself so I took some
foam<00:05:49.739> padding<00:05:50.279> and<00:05:50.429> wrapped<00:05:51.119> it<00:05:51.299> around<00:05:51.359> it<00:05:51.809> to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
foam padding and wrapped it around it to

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.309 
foam padding and wrapped it around it to
increase<00:05:52.649> the<00:05:53.039> diameter<00:05:53.939> slightly<00:05:54.839> in<00:05:54.989> it<00:05:55.079> it

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 
increase the diameter slightly in it it

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.129 
increase the diameter slightly in it it
gives<00:05:55.559> a<00:05:55.709> nice<00:05:55.829> cushiony<00:05:56.719> feeling<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:57.869> it<00:05:58.019> I

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
gives a nice cushiony feeling to it I

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.649 
gives a nice cushiony feeling to it I
guess<00:05:58.409> so<00:05:59.369> it's<00:05:59.729> really<00:05:59.879> comfortable<00:06:00.329> to<00:06:00.509> hold

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
guess so it's really comfortable to hold

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.229 
guess so it's really comfortable to hold
and<00:06:00.929> it<00:06:01.709> really<00:06:01.979> does<00:06:02.159> cut<00:06:02.399> nice<00:06:02.609> despite<00:06:03.059> its

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:03.239 
and it really does cut nice despite its

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:07.159 
and it really does cut nice despite its
very<00:06:03.569> small<00:06:03.779> size<00:06:04.379> and<00:06:05.209> so<00:06:06.209> it<00:06:06.449> really<00:06:06.959> cuts

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
very small size and so it really cuts

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.509 
very small size and so it really cuts
good<00:06:07.759> cuts<00:06:08.759> very<00:06:08.909> well<00:06:09.209> quickly<00:06:10.099> so<00:06:11.099> you<00:06:11.369> can

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:11.519 
good cuts very well quickly so you can

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:13.219 
good cuts very well quickly so you can
