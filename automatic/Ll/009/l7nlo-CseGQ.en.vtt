androgens but men make a lot more which

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
androgens but men make a lot more which
is<00:01:15.750> why<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.170> usually<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:16.890> body<00:01:17.100> hair

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
is why they usually have more body hair
