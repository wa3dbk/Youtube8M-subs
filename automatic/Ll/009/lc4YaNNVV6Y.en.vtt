00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.930
Alright guys, here's another question, this
one just says “My skin looks dull, I've

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:24.910
tried Kojic acid on my face and I had stopped
because it gave my face a grey ghost look.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.680
What would you recommend and how do I use
it?"

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
Then she asked me another question, she was
like "My skin shade is a bit darker than Gabrielle

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.890
Union but I would love to get your shade or
two shades lighter than my skin tone."

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.570
Here' my replies to her; I was really, like,
when (inaudible) send me this kinds of questions,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.680
I'm really frank, I don't judge anybody but
here's what I had to say to her.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.450
I said "Hi, thanks for the kind words, why,
my area expertise is not a recommended skin

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.969
lightening cream so people (inaudible) have
a pigmentation, I can give you few pointers

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.110
on how to brighten your complexion, okay.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.259
So (inaudible) thing that I'm just (inaudible)
skin lightening creams and besides I use this

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.190
light like one was getting so bright in this
video is because of my lighting now if I go

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.310
back you'd see like, so yeah.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.939
This is what I recommend for her, tips.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.500
Number one, drink a lot of water.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.749
I drink lots and lots of water.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:56.439
I exercise so when you exercise, you drink
like at least three, four bottles of Desani

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.590
water, at least three, you'd consume that
while you're exercising, that's a lot of water.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.420
Number two, eat at lots of vegetables.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.470
Number three, use vitamin c serum and retinol
on your face, yes.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.090
Vitamin C is a natural skin brightener so
don't be alarmed.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.530
I use tretinoin as prescribed by my dermatologist.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.810
If you're unable to get to a dermatologist,
there's a plethora of sites that sell, vitamin

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.910
c or retinol products, example; Pro Derma
Light, going to leave it below for you guys.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.069
My fourth recommendation to her was use moisturizer
with SPF.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:50.569
I use Neutrogena Ageless Intensive Deep Wrinkle
Daily Moisturizer, that's really long.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.980
My fifth recommendation to her was for your
body, I would say don't mess up your skin

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.510
with harsh chemicals.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:06.680
It is not worth it, trust me, it is not worth
it.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.950
For people who would like brighter skin complexion
on your body, I would say get an exfoliating

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.209
body scrub, okay.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:26.129
Your skin has just probably taken a lot of
hit from just the weather, pollution, dead

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.129
skin.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.760
So get yourself a good exfoliating scrub and
mild brightening lotion, okay.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.420
The one I use is from Clarins, it's a really,
really highly reputable, Clarin is a really,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.311
really good skin care brand, it's natural,
it's called Clarins Bright (inaudible) Brightening

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:53.329
Hydrating Day Lotion, this is not a bleaching
cream, okay.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.739
So don’t expect to go from Kelly Rowland
to Beyoncé at all.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.770
(inaudible) to her was shower twice daily
and reapply your products, okay?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.770
It's pretty easy.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:18.170
A bonus tip, that I recommended was her taking
supplements, I take vitamin E, vitamin C 1000

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:26.420
mg, selenium and Quercetin, I wonder if this
is how it's pronounced, every day.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:36.360
I'm trying to not get old, seriously, I was
just planning for my future but these vitamins

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.630
help with skin care just to have a glowing
skin that looks healthy, you know that's really

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:54.950
a plus for any female, okay, for glowing,
not a white skin or just like (inaudible),

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.950
like, just healthy looking, bright skin, okay.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.660
Alright guys, that's it for me.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.540
If you have any questions do feel free to
ask.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:14.170
I'm pretty candid with my answers, like, I
have nothing to hide, yeah, and I don't feel

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:25.130
like you should also feel like ashamed or
like just embarrassed to ask anything, do

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.370
so, alright.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.990
Bye.
