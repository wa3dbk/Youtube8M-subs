00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.310

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.150
ODEN WAS MY ONLY SON.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.750
HE WAS THE BAD BOY THE FAMILY.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.720
HE WAS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.830

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.320
AND AFTER MY DAUGHTER HAD HER

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.740
DAUGHTER, ODEN BECAME --

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.620
ONE OF HER RECITALS.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.080
ODEN WAS HURT BIG -- HER BIGGEST

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.320

AND THAT WAS INTRODUCING ME TO

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.360
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.160

EVERY DAY OF MY SON'S LIFE THAT

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.990
IS BEEN WITH HIM.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.870
THE DAY I LAID MY SON ODEN TO

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.870
I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO GO INTO

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.220
THAT HOLE WITH MY SON.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.530
I WOULD NEVER HAVE A GRANDCHILD

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590
FROM MY SON.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.930

HE WILL NEVER GET TO DANCE AT MY

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.740
WEDDING.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.710
I WILL NEVER HEAR MY SON SAY,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.660
"MOM, DID YOU COOK? MOM, GO TO

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.060

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.170

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.560
STRENGTH TO GO ON.

I FORGIVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAD A

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.400
