00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
goes for two to three to four days
depending<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.630> grade<00:00:39.870> level<00:00:39.900> in<00:00:40.260> which

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
depending on what grade level in which

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.800 
depending on what grade level in which
things<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.770> being<00:00:40.950> tested<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.090> that's<00:00:42.540> my

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
things are being tested so that's my

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.580 
things are being tested so that's my
main<00:00:44.330> objection<00:00:45.330> against<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.900> but<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.380> also

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
main objection against it but I also

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.050 
main objection against it but I also
feel<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> high-stakes<00:00:47.760> test<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.540> not

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
feel that high-stakes test is not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.630 
feel that high-stakes test is not
appropriate<00:00:51.170> anyways<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.560> of<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
appropriate anyways because of the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910 
appropriate anyways because of the
timeline<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.620> curriculum<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
timeline of the curriculum and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
timeline of the curriculum and
everything<00:00:56.250> too<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.670> importance<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
everything too much importance is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.630 
everything too much importance is
attached<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.710> moment<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.430> time

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
attached to it it's one moment in time

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
attached to it it's one moment in time
one<00:01:00.060> slice<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.810> there's<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.500> many<00:01:01.590> things

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
one slice and there's so many things

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.620 
one slice and there's so many things
that<00:01:02.040> can<00:01:02.250> affect<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.730> child's<00:01:02.940> ability<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
that can affect a child's ability to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.179 
that can affect a child's ability to
test<00:01:03.899> well<00:01:04.140> whether<00:01:04.409> they're<00:01:04.829> just<00:01:05.009> not<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
test well whether they're just not a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
test well whether they're just not a
good<00:01:05.369> tester<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> questions<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.830> worded

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
good tester the questions are worded

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.880 
good tester the questions are worded
sort<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> tricky<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.740> do

sort of in a tricky way well is I do

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.590 
sort of in a tricky way well is I do
feel<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:11.970> developing<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
feel that it's not developing the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
about 80% certain that colleges don't

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.510 
about 80% certain that colleges don't
look<00:01:30.690> at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.870> star<00:01:31.080> test<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.770> what

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
look at the star test at all what

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
look at the star test at all what
matters<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.060> SATs<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> AC<00:01:33.990> tease<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
matters are the SATs the AC tease and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
matters are the SATs the AC tease and
their<00:01:34.799> grade<00:01:35.010> point<00:01:35.280> average<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> everything

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
their grade point average and everything

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760 
their grade point average and everything
that<00:01:36.330> goes<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.510> what<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.900> understand<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that goes with what I understand that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
that goes with what I understand that
there<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.430> resolution<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.330> against

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
there the resolution is against

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.649 
there the resolution is against
standardized<00:01:40.770> testing<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> would<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
standardized testing and would like to

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.450 
standardized testing and would like to
have<00:01:42.840> local<00:01:43.170> control<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:44.100> make<00:01:44.250> their<00:01:44.430> own

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
have local control to make their own

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.810 
have local control to make their own
local<00:01:45.390> assessments<00:01:46.140> instead<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> using<00:01:46.820> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
local assessments instead of using a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
local assessments instead of using a
statewide<00:01:48.420> star<00:01:49.080> test<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:51.260> I<00:01:52.260> think<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
statewide star test and I think it's a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.359 
statewide star test and I think it's a
in<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.400> very<00:01:53.729> important<00:01:54.270> statement<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.860> austin
