00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.870
 my friends are pure champion 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.900
 There are not many who did not make a video 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.640
 eating 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:32.039
 I was already doing pure routines 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.039
 and well then 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 6 weeks left 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.480
 for the next show 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.020
 Now I climbed down to the scale to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.020
 the scale 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.210
 ipc 105 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.320
 kilos 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 already with two meals 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 then imagine that fasting I walk in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.530
 103 and a half 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.440
 104 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.710
 or the same does not vary so much he is in 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.590
 fasting but because then it is not late and I 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.020
 I get up early and like after 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 breakfast cardio 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 then about 104 out there 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.909
 my percentage of fat number medi but 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:30.030
 Well maybe I'm already in the 4 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.439
 maybe at least every day I start to see 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.340
 more more better as they say over there like 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.149
 says the song 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 I start to see more and more more stuck 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.920
 thinner skin more stripes 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.649
 right now to the diet 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.649
 they are 275 grams of carbohydrates a day 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.010
 and good protein 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 Well, more or less they are like 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.680
 fifty 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.149
 45 grams per meal are 7 meals 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.149
 and you do the sum 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.880
 but they are like 350 800 grams of protein 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.970
 of animals, not of plants or of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.740
 the tales the carbohydrates and good 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.080
 how much are those proteins because they do not 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.890
 they do not work for the muscle 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890
 so 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.900
 nothing else I tell those of the chicken fish 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.230
 Turkey 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.930
 meat right now is everything I recommend 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.730
 no longer as clear in the morning meal 1 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.730
 after 50 minutes of cardio 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.819
 It's a cup of oatmeal 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.650
 without organic gluten 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.500
 and 12 ounces of beef in this case 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.760
 use fillet 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.760
 fillet steak 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:21.900
 12 ounces because 12 by 3 are like 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:26.090
 they are 360 grams already cooked 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.170
 it's quite meat and the rate of meats 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.290
 oats 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.709
 maybe they throw us about 75 grams 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.709
 of carbohydrates 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:41.620
 that is after the change 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.780
 at 6 in the morning at 9 am I come to the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.720
 house and like 10 ounces of turkey breast 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:53.430
 already cooked are 300 grams 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.430
 and a cup of brown rice 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.670
 or some nap 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.420
 to 1112 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.510
 if this food 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.780
 like 10 ounces of tilapia 300 grams of 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.740
 cooked tilapia and another cup of rice 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.740
 integral 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.400
 and later 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 I rest a while 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.530
 before going to the gym right now I'm 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.889
 taking the protein 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.040
 the live tour before going to the gym is 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.500
 a measure of clay with 25 grams of 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:42.030
 carbohydrates and 2 measures of 80 if they are 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.030
 50 grams of protein 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.400
 and I put half a cup of blackberries a little 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.590
 of sugar and 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.509
 and well, it's an antioxidant, but 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.949
 This applies mother what are the calories 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.949
 the sugars 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:06.480
 well I put it a bit of flavor with 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 blackberries or with the partridges blueberries 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:16.510
 then like right now it's my maximum 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.600
 of the day of proteins with berries 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.660
 and I'm going by train or during the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.910
 training then recruit minami 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.070
 creatine 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.440
 I oxidize in my diet today I am at our 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.520
 eating this that is making me such 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.449
 time 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.939
 this here is about the hours 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.240
 that everything is cooked that everything is 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:47.470
 thawed everything is ready 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.930
 even a great job 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:55.350
 because sometimes you do not take out the freezer 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.350
 this does begin the sizes 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.080
 then we came out champions 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.319
 this 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.060
 it's a diet that my coach puts me 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.409
 banal fakirism 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.810
 from the prop coaches 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:16.710
 with athletes in the Olympia 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.710
 854 centers 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.070
 I recommend it 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.050
 and what 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.729
 better than ever 'll get out all 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.300
 champions 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:34.889
 very well 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.889
 I swear cheerleader
