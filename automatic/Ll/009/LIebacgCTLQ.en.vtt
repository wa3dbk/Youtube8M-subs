00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.009
 Good day to all in this video I want 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.799
 demonstrate how is happening 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.540
 land preparation for planting seeds by 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.690
 my opinion is the most important point 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.940
 because it depends on the harvest 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.270
 or not you can say no right to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.270
 mistake and so let's start now you see how 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.109
 mix earth with peat in proportion 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 one to one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.180
 then to the resulting mixture should also 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 add sand 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.219
 note that prepared 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.649
 the ground should be soft and lump free 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 after you have prepared the ground you can 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 start stuffing cassettes here 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 the crows liked the process itself 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 heating the cassettes with earth this process 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.390
 also 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.210
 a lot of work itself is not difficult 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.149
 however, labor costs need 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.250
 approach responsibly 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.230
 because just like on the stage 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.920
 land preparation is an important stage 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.930
 because if you fall asleep carelessly 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.799
 or wrong in increment it is not enough 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.229
 winter or too much later 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.229
 top fall asleep workshop 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.399
 different amounts of land 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.729
 it may lead to 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.549
 Firstly, in different packages there will be different 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.310
 germination that will negatively affect 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.590
 further secondly if too 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 plant a deep seed then she will 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.759
 long rise 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.299
 maybe in the worst case at all 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:44.649
 do not germinate either if the ground will 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.649
 too little top 77 rosettes then this 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 lead to probable risk 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.750
 leaching sunflower seeds are gone without looking 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.330
 on that as if neatly did not do it 7 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.000
 fragrant a little later I will not tell you 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 some like that's such a method is used 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.520
 for accurate watering 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.090
 back to our cassettes here you can 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.790
 watch 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.390
 the amount of work done also want 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.390
 note 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.519
 what is visible 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.400
 Yes, for now I also want to note that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:28.120
 video was shot 14 December 16 for 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.120
 Fifteen days before the new year when 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.530
 window and snow cold and even the brain and want 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.069
 show on the street 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:40.150
 here we see you yourself 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.480
 planting seeds before planting goes 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.049
 tape test more precisely 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.849
 checking the amount of land in each 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:54.269
 separate fleece and then the process goes 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.819
 just planting ie every seed 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.650
 taken and in each well separate 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.519
 seed process process is very time consuming 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.299
 and you need to have a lot of patience and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.560
 to hour by hour seed for seeds 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.170
 lie one by one you can not be wrong 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:20.530
 because two seeds in one tray 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.159
 unacceptable need to be scrupulous well and 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 desirable 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.230
 hands to be clean so it will be 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.889
 more convenient next we see a year 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.560
 seeds are planted we correct them all 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:36.549
 lay neatly and begin the process 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.500
 falling asleep need to this method 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.159
 also approach responsibly to 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.530
 sunflower seeds 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.799
 pour gently so that the seeds remain 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.569
 centered and evenly spaced 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.060
 distribute the land throughout the tray 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.310
 being done to top was 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.900
 the same layer of earth continue 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.170
 fall asleep in the same vein 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.439
 neatly evenly ground prepared 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.170
 which we initially use even one and 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.750
 same land peat land remind one to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.239
 one proportion some sand added 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:19.549
 here are the final touches we have with 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:23.449
 by you and now we will proceed with you to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.810
 We start tamping gently from the sides and 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:31.349
 gradually gradually all 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.139
 we tamp the seeds to securely love 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:39.320
 everything was fixed and also so that you can 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.320
 it was boldly watered above 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.510
 Well, here is such a device 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.780
 pretty simple which you can 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.030
 enjoy it then we remove the excess 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:59.090
 a land that is still when it's still 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.020
 hit 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:11.810
 so that when watering the water did not flow down the report 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.810
 stayed inside and fed on his arms 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:23.540
 I repeat the same way with the image 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:26.630
 the earth is removed unnecessary yes and everything is on it 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.450
 the landing process itself 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:34.310
 completed you can say now you can 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:38.970
 go to watering too 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:41.039
 responsibly and the process because 1 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:47.220
 especially watering from their very responsible 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:50.490
 so that the seeds trudge up thanks 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.120
 watched listened to what you liked not 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.010
 liked 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.530
 please write in the comments and if 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.320
 still liked it i hope so 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.940
 Of course I liked it then like 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.250

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.250
