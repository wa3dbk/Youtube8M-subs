00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
twist it that's what comes off a guy did
now<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.240> part<00:01:06.510> you'll<00:01:06.750> use<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> make<00:01:07.350> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
now this part you'll use to make your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
now this part you'll use to make your
own<00:01:08.090> separate<00:01:09.090> Scout<00:01:09.390> you'll<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
own separate Scout you'll take this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420 
own separate Scout you'll take this
piece<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.400> whatever<00:01:12.060> side<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.810> goes<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.430> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
piece of whatever side this goes on you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.350 
piece of whatever side this goes on you
would<00:01:14.580> glue<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:18.150> would

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
would glue it on in a way that it would

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.620 
would glue it on in a way that it would
like<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.580> fit<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:21.320> face<00:01:22.320> correctly

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
like you know fit your face correctly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.210 
like you know fit your face correctly
then<00:01:24.630> once<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> glued<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
then once you have a glued on you just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
then once you have a glued on you just
break<00:01:26.580> apart<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.530> sawed<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> off

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
break apart this or sawed it off

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.730 
break apart this or sawed it off
whatever<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.630> put<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.619> know

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
whatever then you can put it on you know

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.330 
whatever then you can put it on you know
closer<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.460> part<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.770> red<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
closer this part so it would be red you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
closer this part so it would be red you
can<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.799> whole

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can have it like this that's one whole

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850 
can have it like this that's one whole
scouting<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> can't<00:01:40.560> wear

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
scouting but that one you can't wear

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.569 
scouting but that one you can't wear
this<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.869> anywhere<00:01:42.920> because<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.220> still<00:01:44.430> has

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this one anywhere because it still has

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.340 
this one anywhere because it still has
this<00:01:44.729> piece<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> piece<00:01:46.649> you'll<00:01:46.920> glue

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
this piece with this piece you'll glue

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.940 
this piece with this piece you'll glue
this<00:01:49.350> side<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
this side on so it would be like this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.679 
this side on so it would be like this
you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> always<00:01:56.430> blew<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.969> outside

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you know you always blew it on outside

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.730 
you know you always blew it on outside
sort<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sort of like that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
sort of like that
once<00:01:59.130> again<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.700> break<00:01:59.880> off<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> back

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
once again you can break off the back

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
once again you can break off the back
piece<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.009> once<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.890> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
piece and once you have it like that you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.370 
piece and once you have it like that you
can<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.390> attach<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.580> we're

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
can just attach it like that and we're

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.720 
can just attach it like that and we're
the<00:02:10.590> only<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:11.070> is<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:13.100> side<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the only thing is that side of this is a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.630 
the only thing is that side of this is a
little<00:02:15.000> pointy<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.920> might<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> file

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
little pointy so you might want to file

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.480 
little pointy so you might want to file
it<00:02:17.820> down<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.600> whatever<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:20.190> would<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
it down or whatever it would be the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.340 
it down or whatever it would be the
easiest<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.250> how<00:02:23.460> you<00:02:23.520> make<00:02:23.850> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
easiest way then that's how you make a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.070 
easiest way then that's how you make a
Dragonball<00:02:25.350> Z<00:02:25.560> scouted
