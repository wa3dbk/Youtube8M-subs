00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.570
 well this time I wanted to show 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.879
 how to reverse the direction of a 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.550
 air conditioning engine in which cases 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.640
 we would need to invest it in the case of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.850
 that we have put a universal plate and 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.180
 when we connect the motor rotates the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.050
 the opposite way and it's not pulling 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.239
 air as I should do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.000
 error could have happened good in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 this case we know that the line in this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 white wire and between the neutral that is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 explainable that comes in here and one of these 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.760
 two cables we have to feed the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960
 capacitor what happens if we feed it 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 correctly from my cable that goes by 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.850
 example here we connect and we have 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.500
 perfectly air 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.660
 having air in a correct way 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.980
 but we disconnected in another moment of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.960
 the strokes in a safe way because 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.330
 is connected to the series if you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 come so I would have light because it's 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 connected to the series that's why they're going to see 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.909
 that rotates from space the engine so 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.030
 we are in this one 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.189
 cable and black cable for example I have 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.829
 to turn tractament in the event that 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.700
 we connect badly for example in 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:29.289
 this is going to have a reverse direction 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.289
 and a weird noise too 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.120
 and the selective is now spinning 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.590
 inverse as the engine should 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.920
 so if we were wrong in this 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 Connection 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 it could be that the motor rotates in direction 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.439
 opposite so 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.479
 we should not be wrong in this type 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.780
 of connection if we are wrong by 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.140
 example and we choose this cable what 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.140
 we changed 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.290
 the place could happen 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.520
 we are also connecting more 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.440
 trained as only here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.410
 where the neutral is connected 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.000
 we connect online 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.100
 if we try 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.680
 we have to show we need 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.390
 or sometimes it happens that we connect the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.920
 motorcycle engine did not turn good because 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.380
 be going from this are reversed 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.650
 the connections connect I know that in the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.769
 Red 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.420
 It will be very very bad because it is working 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.909
 instead of with the start coil is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.010
 working with the work coil 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.620
 then the respite is very very slow that 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.680
 would be wrong connected like that when 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.140
 we connect again different second I know 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.420
 that now 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.860
 we connect the brown all of the black and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.140
 we feed with red line that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.680
 we would go to if it does not work and start 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.579
 there in the opposite direction 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.579
 as well 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.390
 so we see that it starts in sense 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.880
 otherwise this would not be fine 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.590
 so the connection that we should make 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.630
 with paying close attention we must 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.240
 get here the engine has how is the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.460
 connection made to not be wrong in 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.030
 this case we made white history of the 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.050
 line 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.050
 the red wire 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.960
 disconnected 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.390
 and now we have here in black that 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.300
 we have the right turn in this engine 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.760
 the connection is like this could it be that some 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.830
 other brand motor cables 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.510
 colors white black and red were 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.160
 changed or change the color of the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 cables so we must lend a lot 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.420
 attention for when we connect a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.550
 universal plate does not reverse the sense 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.830
 of engine spin because the engine many 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.080
 sometimes it would not tear us or tear us 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.050
 in the opposite direction this connection is 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.730
 useful not only in the evaporator as 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.500
 of the air conditioners but in 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.330
 any engine practically also 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 it helps us to connect in the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.510
 motors of the outdoor units in the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.030
 ventilation happened to me once a 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.330
 factory equipment came connected with the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.489
 turn inside out or turn inside out the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.790
 fan motor of the unit 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.470
 outside the warranty said that I have 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.110
 badly connected the impossible to what 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.610
 connected badly because there would not be 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.230
 team the outdoor unit in no 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.640
 moment he only made the connection of the 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.380
 indoor unit with the outside and 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.390
 should have worked 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.190
 correction I made it and the engine turned on 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.100
 faults inverse 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.650
 so I should pay attention to how 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.720
 turn the motors or what is the connection 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.180
 Correct me also once went on a 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.890
 equipment the shaft the connection of the cables 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.920
 It was wrong and I was doing a 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.230
 double capacitor and the motor of the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.990
 outdoor fan was connected 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.330
 together with the compressor if it received 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.490
 30 micro for god at startup the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.530
 engine practically burned and this came 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
 well from factory to nobody we built it 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.210
 that disassemble the equipment and repair these 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.370
 Factory faults so we can be 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.350
 Attentive to know this type of connections 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.630
 will not help a lot at the time of 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.100
 make repairs or change plates 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.010
 originals when they can not be repaired 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.230
 by a universal plate so the 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.450
 I invite you to subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.280
 also visit what is the full blog 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.950
 service for nothing point blogspot.com 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.470
 rate and good if you liked this video 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.830
 they can like it and they waited for it 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.830
