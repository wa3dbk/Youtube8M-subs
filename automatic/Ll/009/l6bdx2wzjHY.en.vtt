 Let's put a foam on and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.180
 It is interesting to note that 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.820
 This foam looks fine too. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.950
 to give the effect even of comfort 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.650
 Even if it's the touch, do not feel it. 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.420
 roughness and getting really good neighbor 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.620

 Everything leaked all full of holes. 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.120
 you do not take risks to enter a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.290
