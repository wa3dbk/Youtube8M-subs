00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
some of the wigs that are sent to me

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149 
some of the wigs that are sent to me
it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.030> great<00:01:45.299> way<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> fluff<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> hair

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's a great way to fluff out the hair

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's a great way to fluff out the hair
making<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.000> look<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.420> natural<00:01:48.479> less<00:01:49.200> define

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
making it look more natural less define

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.179 
making it look more natural less define
and<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.490> afro<00:01:51.000> textured<00:01:51.450> which<00:01:52.380> would

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
and more afro textured which would

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.030 
and more afro textured which would
equate<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.850> me<00:01:54.090> being<00:01:54.329> African<00:01:54.869> American

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
equate to me being African American

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
equate to me being African American

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
that I'm kind of pulling out here that

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.170 
that I'm kind of pulling out here that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you can see and yeah this is kind of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.050 
you can see and yeah this is kind of
what<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.450> working<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
what I'm working with you can see it the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.009 
what I'm working with you can see it the
color<00:02:34.299> number<00:02:34.510> two<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.349> just<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:36.299> dark<00:02:37.299> brown

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
color number two is just a dark brown

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.520 
color number two is just a dark brown
absolutely<00:02:41.019> love<00:02:41.230> it

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
absolutely love it

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.220 
absolutely love it
I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.580> suitable<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.780> just

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
I think that it is suitable for just

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.650 
I think that it is suitable for just
about<00:02:44.349> every<00:02:44.830> woman<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:46.060> tell<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:46.480> are<00:02:46.630> not

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
about every woman I can tell you are not

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.170 
about every woman I can tell you are not
the<00:02:46.989> softest<00:02:47.440> fibers<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.610> felt<00:02:48.849> they

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the softest fibers that I have felt they

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.220 
the softest fibers that I have felt they
are<00:02:49.420> not<00:02:51.120> irritating<00:02:52.120> but<00:02:52.329> they<00:02:52.480> are<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> little

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
are not irritating but they are a little

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.130 
are not irritating but they are a little
bit<00:02:53.470> coarse<00:02:53.799> but<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> think<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.640> may

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
bit coarse but I think that that may

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.210 
bit coarse but I think that that may
lend<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:57.150> being<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.269> little<00:02:58.569> bit<00:02:59.130> beneficial<00:03:00.130> in

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
lend to being a little bit beneficial in

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.970 
lend to being a little bit beneficial in
the<00:03:00.310> long<00:03:00.340> term<00:03:00.760> as<00:03:00.970> far<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.690> wear<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.769> the
