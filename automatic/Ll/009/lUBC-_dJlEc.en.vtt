you<00:00:32.290> how<00:00:32.320> full<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.280> hard<00:00:33.489> drive<00:00:33.820> is<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:35.290> not

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
you how full the hard drive is I'm not

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.389 
you how full the hard drive is I'm not
sure<00:00:35.559> how<00:00:36.480> useful<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:38.199> these<00:00:38.829> are<00:00:38.980> the

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
sure how useful that is these are the

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.319 
sure how useful that is these are the
specs<00:00:39.789> it<00:00:40.660> comes<00:00:41.019> it<00:00:41.320> comes<00:00:41.500> with<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:42.460> backup

software and you can remove the the

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.439 
software and you can remove the the
cradle<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.730> sits<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.390> with<00:00:50.289> other<00:00:51.449> add-ons

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
cradle that sits on with other add-ons

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.599 
cradle that sits on with other add-ons
like<00:00:53.170> firewire<00:00:53.859> or<00:00:54.089> eSATA<00:00:55.089> et<00:00:55.510> cetera<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:57.129> let

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
like firewire or eSATA et cetera so let

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.579 
like firewire or eSATA et cetera so let
me<00:00:57.699> move<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.059> away<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.660> I'm<00:00:59.109> going<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.379> bring

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
me move this away and I'm going to bring

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.529 
me move this away and I'm going to bring
the<00:01:00.070> hard<00:01:00.280> drive<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.730> talk<00:01:01.089> a<00:01:01.120> little<00:01:01.449> more

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
the hard drive and talk a little more

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.320 
the hard drive and talk a little more
about<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.249> is<00:01:03.399> how<00:01:03.519> it<00:01:03.670> looks<00:01:03.879> like<00:01:04.089> it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
about it so this is how it looks like it

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.650 
about it so this is how it looks like it
has<00:01:04.480> a<00:01:04.510> shiny<00:01:04.900> plastic<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.880> here<00:01:06.940> this<00:01:07.480> is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
has a shiny plastic right here this is

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.990 
has a shiny plastic right here this is
the<00:01:07.810> cradle<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:09.690> if<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.930> pull<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:11.380> out<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.970> is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the cradle and if I pull it out this is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.960 
the cradle and if I pull it out this is
how<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:13.780> works

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
how it works

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.350 
how it works
I<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:17.440> don't<00:01:17.620> know<00:01:17.830> how<00:01:17.980> useful<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.270> if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
I I don't know how useful it is and if

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.240 
I I don't know how useful it is and if
you<00:01:19.480> already<00:01:19.660> have<00:01:20.080> it<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.380> won't<00:01:20.680> see<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.040> ever

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
you already have it I won't see you ever

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.880 
you already have it I won't see you ever
changing<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.120> cradle<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.380> let<00:01:23.560> me<00:01:23.650> talk<00:01:23.830> about

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
changing the cradle so let me talk about

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.060 
changing the cradle so let me talk about
some<00:01:24.490> pluses<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.330> minuses<00:01:25.930> well<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.890> big

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
some pluses and minuses well the big

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.130 
some pluses and minuses well the big
plus<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.760> USB<00:01:28.060> 3.0<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.590> also<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:31.330> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
plus it's a USB 3.0 and also the the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.590 
plus it's a USB 3.0 and also the the
actual<00:01:32.470> enclosure<00:01:33.070> has<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.490> lot<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:34.090> openings

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
actual enclosure has a lot of openings

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.250 
actual enclosure has a lot of openings
here<00:01:35.370> here<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:39.160> allows<00:01:39.340> it<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.910> be

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
here here and that allows it to be

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.960 
here here and that allows it to be
relatively<00:01:41.610> cool<00:01:43.620> one<00:01:44.620> -<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.280> I've<00:01:45.460> noticed

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
relatively cool one - that I've noticed

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
relatively cool one - that I've noticed
is<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.440> wish<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.800> kind<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.070> knew<00:01:48.220> before<00:01:48.670> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
is and I wish I kind of knew before is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860 
is and I wish I kind of knew before is
the<00:01:50.350> proprietary<00:01:51.160> cable<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.330> goes<00:01:52.510> in<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
the proprietary cable that goes in the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.230 
the proprietary cable that goes in the
back<00:01:53.110> I'm<00:01:53.500> really<00:01:54.130> not<00:01:54.280> sure<00:01:54.340> why<00:01:54.760> they<00:01:54.970> can

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
back I'm really not sure why they can

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.540 
back I'm really not sure why they can
just<00:01:55.540> use<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.110> regular<00:01:57.000> USB<00:01:58.000> 3.0<00:01:59.220> B<00:02:00.220> type

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
just use the regular USB 3.0 B type

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.160 
just use the regular USB 3.0 B type
connector<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:03.100> if<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.910> tend<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.300> lose<00:02:04.540> cables

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
connector so if you tend to lose cables

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.140 
connector so if you tend to lose cables
I'm<00:02:05.620> not<00:02:05.800> sure<00:02:06.040> how<00:02:06.190> but<00:02:06.400> if<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.640> tend<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.030> lose

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
I'm not sure how but if you tend to lose

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.930 
I'm not sure how but if you tend to lose
cables<00:02:07.780> or<00:02:07.960> if<00:02:08.110> they<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:09.009> your<00:02:09.220> cat<00:02:09.519> chews<00:02:09.910> on

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
cables or if they if your cat chews on

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.480 
cables or if they if your cat chews on
it<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.479> your<00:02:10.629> dog<00:02:10.869> chews<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.680> you're<00:02:12.340> out<00:02:12.460> of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
luck you're gonna have to get the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.550 
luck you're gonna have to get the
original<00:02:15.360> ck

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560

usb-cable<00:02:18.030> another<00:02:19.030> plus<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.019> found<00:02:20.440> is

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
usb-cable another plus that I found is

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.899 
usb-cable another plus that I found is
that<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.629> adapter<00:02:22.629> is<00:02:23.430> universal<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.730> will

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
that the adapter is universal so it will

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.830 
that the adapter is universal so it will
work<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.540> any<00:02:26.140> country<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:27.239> has<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.269> voltage

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
work in any country that has a voltage

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.430 
work in any country that has a voltage
between<00:02:28.870> 100<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.739> 240<00:02:30.400> bolts<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.140> would

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
between 100 and 240 bolts so you would

second for read and write which is

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.440 
second for read and write which is
really<00:02:48.849> nice<00:02:49.170> speeds<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.310> overall<00:02:51.940> I'm<00:02:52.269> pretty

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
