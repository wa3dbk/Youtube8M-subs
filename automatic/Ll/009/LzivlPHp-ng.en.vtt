00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.980 

yeah<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.589> think<00:00:07.710> obviously<00:00:08.660> we're<00:00:09.660> trying<00:00:09.900> to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
yeah I think obviously we're trying to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.129 
yeah I think obviously we're trying to
keep<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.849> safety<00:00:12.269> aspects

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
keep up with the the safety aspects

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.049 
keep up with the the safety aspects
every<00:00:13.320> year<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.799> every<00:00:14.280> year<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.639> come<00:00:14.730> back

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
every year and every year we come back

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939 
every year and every year we come back
there's<00:00:15.330> there's<00:00:15.900> been<00:00:16.080> improvements<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
there's there's been improvements to

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.029 
there's there's been improvements to
make<00:00:17.310> sure<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> drivers<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.770> less

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
make sure that the drivers are at less

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
make sure that the drivers are at less
risk<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.640> also<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> spectators<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.439> you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
risk and also the spectators but you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
risk and also the spectators but you
know<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:23.970> over<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> morning

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know we see here over just this morning

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.650 
know we see here over just this morning
having<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.910> upgrades<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.539> know

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
having a look at the upgrades you know

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.800 
having a look at the upgrades you know
you've<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:28.070> you've<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.240> barrier

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
you've got you've got and the barrier

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150 
you've got you've got and the barrier
down<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> front<00:00:31.260> straight<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> being<00:00:31.949> moved

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
down the front straight is being moved

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.880 
down the front straight is being moved
back<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.700> there's<00:00:32.880> more<00:00:33.000> room<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.630> cars<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
back so there's more room for cars to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.370 
back so there's more room for cars to
sort<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> escape<00:00:35.880> any<00:00:36.120> damage<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.960> someone

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
sort of escape any damage if if someone

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
sort of escape any damage if if someone
stalls<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> line<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> bit

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
stalls on the line you can use a bit

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540 
stalls on the line you can use a bit
more<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:39.989> off<00:00:40.230> road<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.340> round

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
more of that off road to to get round

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
more of that off road to to get round
them<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.719> someone<00:00:43.110> gets<00:00:43.260> collected

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
them and also if someone gets collected

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
them and also if someone gets collected
and<00:00:43.980> bounces<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.969> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> safety

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and bounces into the into the safety

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
and bounces into the into the safety
barrier<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.430> bounce<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:47.969> onto<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
barrier they don't bounce back onto the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
barrier they don't bounce back onto the
track<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.170> front<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> people<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.579> great

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
track in front of people so that's great

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.260 
track in front of people so that's great
but<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.480> suppose<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.489> downside<00:00:53.969> will

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
but I suppose the the downside will

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.520 
but I suppose the the downside will
probably<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.930> there's<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
probably be that there's going to be a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.369 
probably be that there's going to be a
site<00:00:56.000> debris<00:00:57.000> fence<00:00:57.300> along<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> side<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
site debris fence along the side in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
site debris fence along the side in
front<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> spectators<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
front of the spectators and they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.049 
front of the spectators and they
probably<00:01:00.329> won't<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> too<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.500> but

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
probably won't like that too much but

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.130 
probably won't like that too much but
fortunately<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.270> very<00:01:03.480> Heights<00:01:03.780> only

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fortunately it's not very Heights only

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
fortunately it's not very Heights only
two<00:01:04.290> meters<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.460> two<00:01:05.489> meters<00:01:05.909> high<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
two meters just over two meters high so

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
two meters just over two meters high so
that<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.260> able<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.920> over<00:01:08.250> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that we have is able to see over it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
that we have is able to see over it
there's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> good<00:01:08.760> bank<00:01:09.030> good<00:01:09.750> hill<00:01:09.990> behind<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
there's a good bank good hill behind so

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
there's a good bank good hill behind so
they<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.760> over<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.090> top<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.299> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
they can see right over the top of it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
they can see right over the top of it
and<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> suppose<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.580> someone

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and but you know I suppose if someone

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.550 
and but you know I suppose if someone
was<00:01:15.270> injured<00:01:15.450> they'd<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.900> asking<00:01:16.259> why<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
was injured they'd be asking why that

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
was injured they'd be asking why that
wasn't<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.420> good

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
wasn't there so you know it's all good

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
wasn't there so you know it's all good
okay<00:01:19.290> oh<00:01:19.470> yeah<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> modifications<00:01:20.820> down

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
okay oh yeah the modifications down

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.870 
okay oh yeah the modifications down
through<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> chase<00:01:22.259> they've<00:01:23.100> they've

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
through the chase they've they've

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.870 
through the chase they've they've
changed<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> profile<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> wall<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:26.070> think

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
changed the profile of the wall I think

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
changed the profile of the wall I think
this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.150> good<00:01:27.330> thing<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.720> we've<00:01:28.020> seen

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this is a good thing because we've seen

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.499 
this is a good thing because we've seen
some<00:01:28.409> pretty<00:01:28.560> horrific<00:01:28.979> accidents<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
some pretty horrific accidents out of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.630 
some pretty horrific accidents out of
the<00:01:30.630> chase<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:31.979> angle<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the chase because of the angle of that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.859 
the chase because of the angle of that
that<00:01:32.820> wall<00:01:33.110> did<00:01:34.250> sit<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> past<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that wall did sit in the in the past you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.179 
that wall did sit in the in the past you
know<00:01:36.900> you'd<00:01:37.110> hit<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.950> pretty

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
know you'd hit it at a at a pretty

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
know you'd hit it at a at a pretty
decent<00:01:38.820> angle<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
decent angle so now it's more of a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.590 
decent angle so now it's more of a
straight<00:01:40.890> line<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> follows<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.329> track

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
straight line it follows the the track

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
straight line it follows the the track
and<00:01:43.009> as<00:01:44.009> opposed<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.430> probably<00:01:44.700> less

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and as opposed there's probably less

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.380 
and as opposed there's probably less
room<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:46.079> come<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.610> run<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
room to to come off and and run back on

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
room to to come off and and run back on
but<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.530> hit<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> fence

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
but you know if you do hit the fence
