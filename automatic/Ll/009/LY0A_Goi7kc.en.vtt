00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.880
 creteil 13th confronts orleans 14th 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.980
 two teams are tied on points and 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.080
 so count every 2 7 points 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.360
 advanced on the 18th place 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.010
 the maintenance is perhaps no longer 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.320
 very far for that it is still necessary 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.600
 win a few matches and toe at 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.949
 home will try to get these three 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.890
 victory points it will be without 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.650
 diarrassouba suspended dabo sangaré and 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.680
 andriatsima are injured on the Orleans side 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.840
 darcis to the king and pau are absent from the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.790
 day a team of orleans who only took 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.979
 only one point on the last four 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.089
 matches but who on the outside comes from 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.559
 from time to time to do some 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.659
 interesting results 3 victories 5 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.820
 zero for only 6 losses 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.140
 Creteil warned the first action 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.330
 interesting and Orlean 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.339
 with this free kick deflected on the bar 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.339
 transverse by the cristolian keeper 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.629
 yann kerboriou a first action 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.879
 interesting for olive players 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.799
 frapolli the cristolian answer 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.130
 intervenes on this action balloons 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.720
 stuck in thomas renault gloves 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.710
 for the opening of the cristolian score 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.229
 but the goal is denied fault on the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.659
 guardian of orleans créteil must therefore 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.689
 return to the attack with this news 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.689
 strike the deflected ball against a corner 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.009
 the corner is shot quickly with this 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.359
 recovery of the head at close range and the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.479
 first goal of the match signed for sheikh 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.759
 ndoye 33rd minute 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.890
 creteil leads 1 0 this is the ninth goal 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.420
 of the season for sheikh ndoye who is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.679
 the top scorer of the club cristolien la 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.859
 answer from orleans with this shot 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.509
 largely out of the box 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.479
 but visitors are doing a good part 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.530
 outside 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.520
 even if they are not yet enough 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.579
 accurate creteil that keeps the ball 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.079
 until half time 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.310
 whistled by the referee of the match johan 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.530
 hamel on a score of 1 0 at the break 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.709
 olive frapolli decides to make a 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.900
 change benjelloun yusuf is replaced 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.640
 by guillaume loriot 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.830
 it's the choice of the Orleans coach for 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.130
 try to get at least the point of 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.500
 draw 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.150
 creteil on his side only lost three 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.780
 home games this season having 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.019
 led to score 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.420
 the cristolians have the confidence 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.849
 necessary to confirm this result 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 even if they are on two defeats and 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.430
 that they have experienced defeat four times 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.530
 on the last 5 games the attak and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.980
 especially at half-mast with a goal scored on 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.269
 the last seven meetings 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 and here it's a huge news 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.450
 opportunity to double the bet it's out 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.090
 and parra orleans 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.599
 visitors therefore always stay in 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.459
 the game 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.430
 watch out for this messy balloon and 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:03.110
 released by yann kerboriou he became 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.400
 scared captain of orleans maxim 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.100
 Brillault was not far to try 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.170
 to take advantage of this adverse mistake but 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.870
 that's not the case most 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.989
 opportunities are francilienne in this 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.220
 match but it does not pass and creel 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.859
 who until the end is still going 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.560
 successfully maintain its advantage 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.560
 victory of créteil 1 0 against orléans 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.920
 all
