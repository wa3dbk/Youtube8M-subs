look at the packaging here which is
quite<00:00:56.089> substantially<00:00:57.079> large<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.400> large

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
quite substantially large it's so large

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.579 
quite substantially large it's so large
so<00:00:59.089> that<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.570> can't<00:00:59.809> even<00:00:59.930> see<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.290> rest<00:01:00.470> of

so that you can't even see the rest of
my<00:01:00.739> backdrop<00:01:02.199> we<00:01:03.199> get<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.379> good<00:01:03.620> image<00:01:03.920> of

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
my backdrop we get a good image of

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.270 
my backdrop we get a good image of
Robert<00:01:05.119> Englund<00:01:05.239> as<00:01:05.690> Freddy<00:01:06.440> on<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:07.100> the

Robert Englund as Freddy on the on the
side<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.850> we<00:01:07.910> also<00:01:08.060> get<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.330> good

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
side and we also get a good

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.050 
side and we also get a good
representation<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:10.100> Jason<00:01:10.610> on<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.759> other

side<00:01:11.479> ages<00:01:12.380> 8<00:01:12.610> 18<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:15.440> would<00:01:15.740> be

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
side ages 8 18 and up it would be

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.070 
side ages 8 18 and up it would be
surprising<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.610> see<00:01:16.910> that<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.270> says<00:01:17.450> 18<00:01:17.810> enough

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
surprising to see that it says 18 enough

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.490 
surprising to see that it says 18 enough
but<00:01:18.289> I<00:01:18.320> guess<00:01:18.530> due<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.160> nature<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:20.500> you

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
but I guess due to the nature of you

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.430 
but I guess due to the nature of you
know<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.860> figures<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.640> involves<00:01:23.440> it's

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
know the figures that it involves it's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.660 
know the figures that it involves it's

features<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:57.050> set<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:58.069> have<00:01:58.160> a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
features of the set so we have a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.029 
features of the set so we have a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
actually know what I would into that in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.600 
actually know what I would into that in
a<00:03:49.430> second<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:50.769> there's<00:03:51.769> conceivable<00:03:52.370> amount

of detail put into his glove as well one
surprising<00:03:55.459> thing<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> fact<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.510> his

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
surprising thing is the fact that his

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.820 
surprising thing is the fact that his
blades<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.950> his<00:03:58.459> claws<00:03:58.790> are<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.690> rather<00:04:00.200> sharp

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
and I don't I don't necessarily mean

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.290 
and I don't I don't necessarily mean

for the head to sit into the body itself
as<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.729> result<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:42.680> can<00:05:42.860> only<00:05:42.979> move<00:05:43.159> the<00:05:43.310> head

as a result you can only move the head
so<00:05:43.819> much<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.509> if<00:05:44.689> you<00:05:44.810> bump<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.199> the<00:05:45.289> wrong<00:05:45.469> way

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
so much and if you bump it the wrong way

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
really dark almost like a strawberry

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.260 
really dark almost like a strawberry
color<00:06:41.210> like<00:06:42.199> a<00:06:42.259> strawberry<00:06:42.710> pink<00:06:43.060> but<00:06:44.060> really

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
color like a strawberry pink but really

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.679 
color like a strawberry pink but really
really<00:06:44.479> nice<00:06:44.629> detail<00:06:45.069> I<00:06:46.240> don't<00:06:47.240> know<00:06:47.330> how<00:06:47.509> long

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:47.689 
really nice detail I don't know how long

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:48.939 
really nice detail I don't know how long
does<00:06:47.839> this<00:06:48.020> video<00:06:48.259> might<00:06:48.439> actually<00:06:48.650> be<00:06:48.919> a

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
does this video might actually be a

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:50.559 
does this video might actually be a
two-parter<00:06:49.490> so<00:06:49.639> if<00:06:49.729> it<00:06:49.849> is<00:06:49.939> a<00:06:49.969> two-parter<00:06:50.479> I'll

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
two-parter so if it is a two-parter I'll

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.490 
two-parter so if it is a two-parter I'll
stop<00:06:50.870> it<00:06:51.050> maybe<00:06:51.199> when<00:06:51.379> I<00:06:51.409> get<00:06:51.589> to<00:06:51.680> the<00:06:51.770> Jason

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
stop it maybe when I get to the Jason

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.110 
stop it maybe when I get to the Jason
but<00:06:54.500> that's<00:06:54.889> that's<00:06:55.219> pretty<00:06:55.490> much<00:06:55.699> Freddy

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
but that's that's pretty much Freddy

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.119 
but that's that's pretty much Freddy
there<00:06:56.419> it's<00:06:57.379> a<00:06:57.469> shame<00:06:57.650> that<00:06:57.680> there<00:06:57.919> wasn't

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
there it's a shame that there wasn't

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.519 
there it's a shame that there wasn't
more<00:06:58.250> articulation<00:06:59.029> done<00:06:59.360> Inlet<00:06:59.719> in<00:06:59.900> the<00:06:59.990> leg

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:00.529 
more articulation done Inlet in the leg

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:06.309 
more articulation done Inlet in the leg
area<00:07:00.759> is<00:07:01.759> pretty<00:07:03.939> it's<00:07:04.939> pretty<00:07:05.060> stuck<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.199> way

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 
area is pretty it's pretty stuck the way

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.300 
area is pretty it's pretty stuck the way
it<00:07:06.380> is<00:07:06.529> I<00:07:06.560> mean<00:07:06.770> you're<00:07:06.889> not<00:07:06.949> going<00:07:07.130> to<00:07:07.190> get

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
it is I mean you're not going to get

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.379 
it is I mean you're not going to get
much<00:07:07.550> out<00:07:07.699> of<00:07:07.759> it<00:07:07.940> at<00:07:08.120> all

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:08.389 
much out of it at all

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.260 
much out of it at all
but<00:07:09.169> the<00:07:09.380> detailing<00:07:09.860> is<00:07:10.130> really<00:07:10.490> nice<00:07:10.669> on<00:07:10.880> the

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
but the detailing is really nice on the

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.430 
but the detailing is really nice on the
Fredi<00:07:11.420> itself<00:07:11.950> I<00:07:13.060> think<00:07:14.060> I'll<00:07:14.870> probably<00:07:15.050> wrap
