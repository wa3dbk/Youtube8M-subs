00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
is just a lip balm I've tried one of the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210 
is just a lip balm I've tried one of the
baby<00:03:42.510> lips<00:03:42.750> before<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.560> didn't<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.070> was

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
baby lips before and I didn't think was

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.039 
baby lips before and I didn't think was
anything<00:03:44.459> special<00:03:44.700> but<00:03:45.180> I've<00:03:45.570> heard<00:03:45.810> about

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
anything special but I've heard about

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
anything special but I've heard about
these<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.709> people<00:03:47.040> say<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> they're<00:03:47.459> cool

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
these and people say that they're cool

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.510 
these and people say that they're cool
so<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.600> figured<00:03:49.049> why<00:03:49.230> not<00:03:49.260> try<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.769> and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
so I figured why not try it and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.010 
so I figured why not try it and
see<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.850> got<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.270> one<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.570> was<00:03:51.690> kind<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:51.930> a

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
see I got the one that was kind of a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.810 
see I got the one that was kind of a
peachy<00:03:52.410> shade<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.070> might<00:03:53.280> neutralize

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
peachy shade so that it might neutralize

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.940 
peachy shade so that it might neutralize
my<00:03:54.150> lip<00:03:54.540> color<00:03:54.780> because<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> do<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.740> very

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
my lip color because I do have very

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.940 
my lip color because I do have very
pigmented<00:03:56.460> lips<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.780> nude<00:03:58.170> colors<00:03:58.560> kind<00:03:58.830> of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
pigmented lips so nude colors kind of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.160 
pigmented lips so nude colors kind of
tone<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.370> down<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.240> have<00:04:00.570> more

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
tone that down so that I can have more

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.320 
tone that down so that I can have more
of<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.500> natural<00:04:01.740> color<00:04:02.190> lip<00:04:02.520> that's<00:04:02.670> not<00:04:02.910> like

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
of a natural color lip that's not like

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.840
