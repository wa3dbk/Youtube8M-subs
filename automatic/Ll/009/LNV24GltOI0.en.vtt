00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello I am nocturnal and this is not a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.620
 video that will change your life 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.350
 it's just a video that I'm going to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 express my opinion about a product 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.290
 specifically about a product of a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
 great yogurt company that has decided 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 make the sale long ago and to a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 ingenuity in your experiment that consists 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 in a frozen yogurt and whose name is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.100
 yogurt side in atrocious edge of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.560
 imagination on the part of executives 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.890
 whoever thinks of things and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.599
 come in to take out the sale and as a thing 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.130
 completely new there are cases that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 I will take a month I do not rattle 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 with which I wear one and well, I have 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.280
 fact I have taken one from the freezer to me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 I've eaten it and not so bad it was lemon 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 I like but it was something I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 was disturbing the soul had to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.239
 know more about that product so I 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.200
 I started reading the container and what was my 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 surprise when I discovered here of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 instructions and if those jefazos that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.390
 they made the same instructions for 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.399
 the peanuts they give you on planes 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 to open and eat have decided to make the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 instructions for an iced yogurt 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 then ingenuity to happen to open the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 container and eat it but no no you do not go out in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.229
 the instructions are not only the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.580
 extraction would be too easy what 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.430
 it is better that they study, they are worth three 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.500
 Steps 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.540
 go supermarket closest to the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.870
 section of yogurts and take the product 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.150
 wanted 2 go to your house and put it in the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.390
 freezer 3 as only as a yogurt 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 frozen 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.090
 seriously seriously seriously seriously seriously in 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.000
 what analysts were you thinking when 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.880
 you created a yogurt 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.330
 and my question is what difference there is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.990
 between a normal ice cream 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.729
 you can put or freeze and that the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.260
 bust no more shake after 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.390
 more creamy protective do not eat it 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.150
 but as a part of that and above all 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 what difference between that product and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.619
 frozen yogurts that take you selling 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 since I was five years old I did not 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.729
 I understand and it is that a chair now 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.130
 gentility is not that I do not like yogurts 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.720
 now I have switched to yogurt the tie for 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.229
 danone so that we are advertising or 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.430
 something 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.450
 I have nothing against your product 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 pointed out it just seems like a 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.100
 bullshit but 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.590
 for tastes the colors I 'm not going to 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.570
 buy angel varela from another guy then 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.920
 of buying originality is of life 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.300
 but I will not cheat me as I have 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.280
 said that this is a video that does not have 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.900
 no information you will not learn 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.340
 nothing you are not going to feel like you have 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.870
 learned something but there are already many people 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.459
 who does it and nobody says anything like that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.780
 that because we do not see each other on Thursday 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.490
 comes with what I hope is a video 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 a little more entertaining a little more 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.620
 full of cargo and content and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.590
 Y 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.000
 I like the video you can give to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.440
 and below if you are not already you can subscribe 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.480

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.110
 until next Thursday 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:12.120
 ice cream or who are you thinking about what 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.110
