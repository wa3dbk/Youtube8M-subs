something<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.799> didn't<00:01:11.430> love<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> had

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
something that I didn't love that I had

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
something that I didn't love that I had
almost<00:01:13.229> nothing<00:01:13.470> left<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:14.189> writing<00:01:14.460> music

almost nothing left for writing music
and<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.290> found<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> pace<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.189> which<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.580> was

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and I just found the pace at which I was

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
and I just found the pace at which I was
creating<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.659> lot<00:01:18.930> less<00:01:19.140> than<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.439> knew<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
creating was a lot less than I knew that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.749 
creating was a lot less than I knew that
I'm<00:01:20.159> capable<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.670> been

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I'm capable of and so you know I've been

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
I'm capable of and so you know I've been
doing<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> long<00:01:24.509> time<00:01:24.570> I'm<00:01:24.810> 33<00:01:25.380> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
doing this for a long time I'm 33 now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.600 
doing this for a long time I'm 33 now
and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> point<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.500> guess<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and I just got to a point of I guess you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
and I just got to a point of I guess you
could<00:01:29.640> call<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.909> frustration<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
could call it frustration but the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
could call it frustration but the
contrast<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.270> being<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.560> hundred

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
contrast of not being one hundred

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.179 
contrast of not being one hundred
percent<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.340> my<00:01:35.670> path<00:01:35.880> musically<00:01:37.009> got<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> be

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
percent on my path musically got to be

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
percent on my path musically got to be
painful<00:01:38.430> enough<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.509> put<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:39.900> foot

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
painful enough that I just put my foot

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.679 
painful enough that I just put my foot
down<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> said<00:01:40.680> enough<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> enough<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.509> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
down and I said enough is enough this is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.109 
down and I said enough is enough this is
the<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.020> sure<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:44.280> had<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> make<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
the time sure I had to make a lot of
