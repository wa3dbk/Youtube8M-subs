00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.090
 mode works 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.980
 probably those who have seen sword 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.489
 they see that the most lucid numeration thor and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.050
 is giving her a bracelet and she in the file 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.910
 to decompress comes 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.910
 well he is who of decree 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.510
 to make it look cooler but I 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.510
 can I put 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.010
 Well, if I've made the wrong names and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:04.780
 if it was the risk it was 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:09.840
 if it was the other way around I apologize to see if 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.840
 this time yes no 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.770
 Now I have only created all the spirit 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.660
 of sword 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.860
 and the good one I chose when downloading 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.610
 obviously I will not do it 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.330
 my works are for I do not know if good if 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.480
 it does not keep growing like this if it has 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.410
 good downloads and has like I think 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.440
 add 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.320
 the girlfriend written 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:47.750
 or other characters but if I'm not going to 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.960
 create that cost me find the names 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.060
 look up the names all week 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.310
 last because the names or that the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.960
 colors and all that worked out for me 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.700
 but good 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:09.940
 good light and data is what floats 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.940
 and here and it burns and burns you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:20.200
 the bracelet is that they burn you character of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.200
 a blow does not kill 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.710
 this matter of two strokes but by the 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.170
 explosion 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.960
 he makes an impulse today and he killed in one blow 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.740
 of obviously amateur status a blow on 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.120
 yes well to kill everyone at all 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.090
 Monsters equal up to one level of the mod 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.790
 is super that is super simple no 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.780
 I say we do is the big thing is not 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.780
 So easy 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.860
 it's so simple and all that I do think 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.560
 create an engine that looks like another 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.990
 character and composing with Janko because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.300
 not like in copy mode 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.360
 that thought to occupy true but I do not know 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.160
 mention the browsers with that truth 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.950
 but I 'll look for it and I'll make 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.460
 he always asks me to appear picture his 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.460
 character 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.960
 good to increase in this truth if you 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.900
 liked the video I would appreciate it if you 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.690

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.139

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.970
