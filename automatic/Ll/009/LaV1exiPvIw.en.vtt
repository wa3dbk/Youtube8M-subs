00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so why I think this is a good good

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 
so why I think this is a good good
opportunity<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> pink<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
opportunity is you know the pink and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
opportunity is you know the pink and
black<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.800> tied<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:29.130> you're<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
black are tied up you're right now the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.500 
black are tied up you're right now the
the<00:00:31.170> point<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:33.360> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the point we don't know about from this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.540 
the point we don't know about from this
angle<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:34.110> whether<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> pink<00:00:34.770> spot<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.340> tied

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
angle is whether the pink spot is tied

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
angle is whether the pink spot is tied
up<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:37.110> assume<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> pink

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
up or not like let's assume the pink

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
up or not like let's assume the pink
spot<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> tied<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> shot<00:00:39.600> he

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
spot is tied up I think the shot he

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
spot is tied up I think the shot he
should<00:00:39.989> play<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.530> Blue<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
should play from the Blue is for this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.660 
should play from the Blue is for this
red<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.570> he<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:42.840> stun<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.170> across<00:00:43.620> yes<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
red so he would stun it across yes and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.869 
red so he would stun it across yes and
play<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.390> red<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.309> he<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.730> play

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
play this red right so that he can play

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
play this red right so that he can play
the<00:00:48.719> pink<00:00:48.989> after<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.770> red<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.489> would

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the pink after this red so he would

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.580 
the pink after this red so he would
finish<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> little<00:00:51.329> high<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.899> red<00:00:52.140> later

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
finish a little high on this red later

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.160 
finish a little high on this red later
pink<00:00:52.920> next<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:54.030> once<00:00:54.390> he<00:00:54.570> once<00:00:55.050> you

the<00:01:03.000> black<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.629> black<00:01:04.110> spot<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> pink

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the black the black spot is the pink

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
the black the black spot is the pink
spots<00:01:05.220> covered<00:01:05.580> let's<00:01:06.299> assume<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> pink<00:01:06.930> spot

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
spots covered let's assume the pink spot

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
spots covered let's assume the pink spot
is<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.500> covered<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.580> pink<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:08.970> come<00:01:09.180> back

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is not covered the pink would come back

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.289 
is not covered the pink would come back
on<00:01:09.479> his<00:01:09.600> part<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> he<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.490> open<00:01:11.880> red<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
on his part and he has this open red and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
on his part and he has this open red and
the<00:01:12.450> black<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> again<00:01:13.110> open<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> corner

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the black is again open to this corner

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
the black is again open to this corner
so<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.390> would<00:01:15.869> come

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
and get on top of the blue again and
then<00:01:50.909> come<00:01:51.149> down<00:01:51.180> yes<00:01:51.750> he<00:01:51.930> good<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.439> mean<00:01:52.590> he's

that<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.640> 12<00:01:53.850> points<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.450> there

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that would be 12 points right there

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
that would be 12 points right there
that's<00:01:54.960> true<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.710> he's<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.369> mean<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.759> you

or<00:02:00.930> frame<00:02:01.710> winning<00:02:02.270> contribution<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.869> it's

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
or frame winning contribution then it's

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.200 
or frame winning contribution then it's
inevitable<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.189> need<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
inevitable that you need to get this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
inevitable that you need to get this
area<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.899> order<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.439> gotta<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.890> an<00:02:08.009> order

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
area in order you gotta get in an order

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.160 
area in order you gotta get in an order
that's<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.580> great<00:02:08.789> observation

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.610 

setting<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.750> he<00:02:17.750> should<00:02:18.020> be<00:02:18.140> trying<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.500> do

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
setting what he should be trying to do

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.180 
setting what he should be trying to do
is<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:19.340> on<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.520> red<00:02:19.849> just<00:02:20.390> buy<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.190> better

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
is get on the red just buy the better

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.750 
is get on the red just buy the better
black<00:02:22.489> but<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.000> think<00:02:23.300> he's<00:02:23.690> chosen<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.290> one<00:02:24.760> on

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
black but I think he's chosen the one on

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.750 
black but I think he's chosen the one on
the<00:02:26.060> other<00:02:26.090> right<00:02:26.480> hand<00:02:26.690> side<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.050> pack

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the other right hand side of the pack

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
the other right hand side of the pack
he'll<00:02:28.760> now<00:02:29.030> again<00:02:29.360> need<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.720> go<00:02:29.870> back<00:02:30.050> towards

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
he'll now again need to go back towards

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
he'll now again need to go back towards
blue

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.930 

he's<00:02:41.170> gone<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.440> little<00:02:41.620> too<00:02:41.740> far<00:02:42.070> he's<00:02:42.670> gonna

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
he's gone a little too far he's gonna

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.010 
he's gone a little too far he's gonna
have<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> play<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:44.040> difficult<00:02:45.040> blue<00:02:45.510> or<00:02:46.510> the

know I think you know with the sequence

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.930 
know I think you know with the sequence
of<00:03:07.310> shots<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.970> he<00:03:08.209> chose<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:10.580> had<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.910> a
