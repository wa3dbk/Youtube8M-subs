00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 south direction the ancient theater of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.629
 come crowded last night for an evening 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.210
 nostalgia on stage three giants of the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.040
 paco guitar of lucia al di meola and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.889
 john mc laughlin reunited for the first time 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.009
 14 years ago franck giraud sylvia 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.009
 teeth 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 a night in san francisco entered the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 legend of records recorded at the beginning 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.579
 80s 3 million 500 thousand 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.630
 copies sold a rare success in 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.329
 this musical field 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 after a studio test last year 14 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.380
 years after paco de lucia al di meola and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.129
 john mack laughing have decided to get 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.129
 launch a new challenge 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.079
 obviously these three guitars including kill 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 the man the moment it's my game my 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 instrument 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.989
 and then it causes but what I want 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.989
 it's provocation 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.569
 three styles for a unique encounter 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.100
 the public of Vienna had already had 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.730
 the opportunity to hear them but 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 separately 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.719
 so when these guitar monsters 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.150
 decides to go down in the arena the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.070
 public is pressing +1 of the 8000 tickets to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.409
 sell for a week to the chagrin 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 of an audience almost sometimes to divert the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.210
 way of his vacation to attend 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.370
 the event seems to be rolling 100 200 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 kilometers we do not have 4 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.350
 it's the stage the festival board 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.700
 I think to convince your problem remains 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.690
 more than to return to enjoy the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 evening is a kind of phenomenon 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.360
 incomprehensible but it was if you are 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.730
 a happy phenomenon anyway and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 then had the idea you never know we do 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.229
 never know if we are going to crash 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.229
 it goes well we stop named 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.229
 2 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 complicity or confrontation when the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 mixture ignites the audience is standing
