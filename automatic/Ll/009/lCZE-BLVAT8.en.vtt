00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
crazy so get a run upstairs turn on the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
crazy so get a run upstairs turn on the
generator<00:01:29.750> this'll<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.869> turn<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.229> some

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
generator this'll like turn on some

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.300 
generator this'll like turn on some
lights<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.229> through<00:01:34.530> oh<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
lights so you can get through oh the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.929 
lights so you can get through oh the
window<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.820> starting<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> shrinks<00:01:37.640> yeah<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
window for starting that shrinks yeah it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
window for starting that shrinks yeah it
depends<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> generator<00:01:39.869> oh<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
depends on the generator oh really and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
depends on the generator oh really and
the<00:01:41.640> thing<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> screwed

the thing I like about it see I screwed
up<00:01:43.079> once<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.100> didn't<00:01:44.310> lose<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.700> my

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
up once and it didn't lose all my

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.600 
up once and it didn't lose all my
momentum<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.810> didn't<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.399> didn't<00:01:47.399> kick

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
momentum and it didn't and didn't kick

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
momentum and it didn't and didn't kick
you<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> start<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you back to the start right and it

you back to the start right and it
didn't<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.860> making<00:01:50.430> pause<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> second<00:01:51.299> be

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
didn't like making pause for a second be

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
design decision there's a lot of really

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.510 
design decision there's a lot of really
clever<00:02:01.540> things<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> noticed<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:03.369> this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
is some things of the design of this

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.249 
is some things of the design of this
game<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.640> liked<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.810> don't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.870 
don't remember you talking about but one
of<00:02:11.920> them<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.680> tap<00:02:14.980> ex<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.550> reload

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
of them is that the tap ex to reload

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.809 
of them is that the tap ex to reload
faster<00:02:16.239> mm-hmm<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.620> all<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.580> guns

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
faster mm-hmm because all of the guns

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.040 
faster mm-hmm because all of the guns
use<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.780> single<00:02:20.850> Single<00:02:21.850> rounds<00:02:22.330> there<00:02:22.840> that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
use like single Single rounds there that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.090 
use like single Single rounds there that
and<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.410> not<00:02:23.910> dropping<00:02:24.910> clips<00:02:25.360> um<00:02:26.110> that's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
and not not dropping clips um that's

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.860 
and not not dropping clips um that's
just<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.640> smallest<00:02:28.090> little<00:02:28.269> thing<00:02:28.569> that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
just like the smallest little thing that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
just like the smallest little thing that
makes<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.680> more<00:02:29.830> fun<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.160> keeps<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.819> like

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
makes it more fun and keeps you like

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.420 
makes it more fun and keeps you like
pressing<00:02:32.890> buttons<00:02:33.250> constantly<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.150> like

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
pressing buttons constantly and like

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.670 
pressing buttons constantly and like
just<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.209> all<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.480> time<00:02:37.660> which<00:02:38.350> I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
just really in it all the time which I

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.380 
just really in it all the time which I
don't<00:02:38.980> know<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.580> such<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.120> small

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
don't know it's just a such a small

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.210 
don't know it's just a such a small
thing<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.930> many<00:02:41.080> games<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.830> halos

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
thing like so many games have like halos

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.410 
thing like so many games have like halos
and<00:02:42.250> call<00:02:42.549> of<00:02:42.640> duties<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.030> sup<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.269> that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
and call of duties and sup like that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.000 
and call of duties and sup like that
have<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:45.480> little<00:02:46.480> reload<00:02:46.870> tricks<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:47.950> can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
have a little reload tricks that you can

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.449 
have a little reload tricks that you can
do<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.310> coming<00:02:49.680> speed<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.830> speed<00:02:50.860> up<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
do to coming speed up speed up the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.949 
do to coming speed up speed up the
reload<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.420> really<00:02:52.750> fucking

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
reload and you have to be really fucking

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.600 
reload and you have to be really fucking
good<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> practice<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:54.069> lot<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
good and you have to practice a lot and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.009 
good and you have to practice a lot and
they're<00:02:54.940> certainly<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.269> intended<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.930> be

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
they're certainly not intended to be

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.850 
they're certainly not intended to be
done<00:02:56.290> mm-hmm<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:58.019> gears<00:02:59.019> award<00:02:59.350> has

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
done mm-hmm but this and gears award has

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.280 
done mm-hmm but this and gears award has
a<00:02:59.890> similar<00:03:00.220> system<00:03:00.750> before<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.989> get<00:03:02.080> extra

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
a similar system before you get extra

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.750 
a similar system before you get extra
damage<00:03:02.560> by<00:03:02.859> like<00:03:03.070> hitting<00:03:03.310> reload<00:03:03.579> at<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
damage by like hitting reload at the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
damage by like hitting reload at the
same<00:03:03.940> time<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.359> can<00:03:04.510> fuck<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.049> up<00:03:05.140> but<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:05.980> gets

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
same time you can fuck it up but it gets

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.039 
same time you can fuck it up but it gets
really<00:03:06.250> easy<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.730> perfectly<00:03:07.329> memorize<00:03:07.780> that

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
really easy to perfectly memorize that

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.319 
really easy to perfectly memorize that
and<00:03:08.320> get<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.709> timing<00:03:09.190> down<00:03:09.310> yeah<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.180> this

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
and get that timing down yeah but this

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.340 
and get that timing down yeah but this
is<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.840> simpler<00:03:11.350> way<00:03:11.850> or<00:03:12.850> there's<00:03:13.030> no

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
is just like a simpler way or there's no

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.580 
is just like a simpler way or there's no
um<00:03:16.230> there's<00:03:17.230> no<00:03:17.320> risk<00:03:17.650> mmm<00:03:18.609> yeah<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.180> mean<00:03:19.590> now

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
um there's no risk mmm yeah I mean now

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.099 
um there's no risk mmm yeah I mean now
that<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.829> say<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.579> is<00:03:21.760> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> cool<00:03:22.329> I'd

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
that you say it it is kind of cool I'd

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.690 
that you say it it is kind of cool I'd
me<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:25.060> really<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:26.650> bit<00:03:26.829> yeah<00:03:27.430> I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
me and really is that one bit yeah I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.830 
me and really is that one bit yeah I
hadn't<00:03:28.299> realized<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.299> made<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.600> more<00:03:31.780> fun

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
hadn't realized that it made it more fun

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.479 
hadn't realized that it made it more fun
but<00:03:32.170> now<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:32.590> thinking<00:03:32.620> about<00:03:33.130> it

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
but now that I'm thinking about it

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.310 
but now that I'm thinking about it
uh-huh<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.150> think<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.600> more<00:03:34.870> fun<00:03:35.140> because

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
uh-huh I think it is more fun because

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.130 
uh-huh I think it is more fun because
you're<00:03:35.530> like<00:03:35.650> oh<00:03:35.859> my<00:03:36.160> god<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.850> away<00:03:37.140> xxxxl

yourself ffff it's something a while to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:48.509 
yourself ffff it's something a while to
realize<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.319> um<00:03:42.130> I<00:03:44.040> had<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:47.400> am<00:03:48.400> I

realize that like um I had the am I
trying<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.760> say<00:03:48.910> three<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.540> reloading

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
trying to say three the reloading

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.930 
trying to say three the reloading
mechanism<00:03:50.170> for<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> revolver<00:03:51.280> like<00:03:51.430> life<00:03:51.640> in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
mechanism for the revolver like life in

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.460 
mechanism for the revolver like life in
the<00:03:52.209> first<00:03:52.450> chapter<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.810> found<00:03:53.079> myself<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
the first chapter I found myself a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.470 
the first chapter I found myself a
couple<00:03:53.769> times<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:54.160> stuff<00:03:54.519> like<00:03:54.609> hitting<00:03:55.329> X

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
couple times just stuff like hitting X

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.780 
couple times just stuff like hitting X
once<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.139> then<00:03:56.230> shooting<00:03:56.650> uh-huh<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.430> then

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
once and then shooting uh-huh and then

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.640 
once and then shooting uh-huh and then
thinking<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.269> completely<00:03:58.720> reloaded<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.769> I<00:03:59.799> had

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
thinking I completely reloaded but I had

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.770 
thinking I completely reloaded but I had
and<00:04:00.739> then<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.519> realize<00:04:01.819> though<00:04:02.000> just<00:04:02.510> keep

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
and then I realize though just keep

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.059 
and then I realize though just keep
jamming<00:04:03.110> X<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.209> go<00:04:05.209> faster<00:04:05.629> yeah<00:04:06.530> way<00:04:07.010> to

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
jamming X and go faster yeah way to

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.250 
jamming X and go faster yeah way to
tells<00:04:07.400> me<00:04:07.640> how<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.030> do<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.420> yeah<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.019> does<00:04:09.230> but

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
tells me how to do that yeah it does but

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.309 
tells me how to do that yeah it does but
even<00:04:10.099> then<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:11.269> takes<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:12.079> took<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> couple

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
even then it takes it took a couple

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.960 
even then it takes it took a couple
seconds<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:12.980> them<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.340> couple<00:04:13.519> minutes<00:04:13.730> for

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
seconds for them a couple minutes for

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.710
