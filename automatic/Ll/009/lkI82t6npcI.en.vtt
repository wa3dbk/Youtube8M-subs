00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.349
 and I wanted to ask you if you 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.270
 want me to keep bringing textures 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.340
 for minecraft if you want 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.399
 find the text of the document there 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.379

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.190

 craft the last is that he threw in the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.230
 name of the hill and metalÃºrgi mode that's it 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.980

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.300
 a lot a way I 'm here with in the trunk 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.420

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.649
 items and we'll show you the tools you 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.170
 add add first as it was 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.869
 you first have these items 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.780
 basically the opening of the xiii has 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:17.690
 it's like the most hoarse diamond in the media 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.920
 more bizarre wooden sword than it would have 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.900
 but it's alright 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 good how are you seeing here in my 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 hand the diamond sword right 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.510
 so it's more rotated, it's just that it does not 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.970
 It's that way because I loved it. 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.979
 that's the normal way she 's spoken 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.690
 normal that she's like that guys 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.210
 we also have gold that changes is that the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.510
 opening is also nice, right? 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.450
 the iron she gives a dead on the road 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.090
 iron stone stone demand 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.400
 cool suit and is made of wood that is 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.070
 only as if it were a stick in the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.159
 Your hand, but it's okay, it's left to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:02.360
 these items also adds that 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.090
 this kind of stone that two new 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.349
 blocks that should basically be gold 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.239
 I do not know how to be a captain in the 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.780
 forum was not showing put tape 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.970
 and the furnaces geeks on furnaces do not 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 It shows as graphite too but I'm 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.490
 showing here right? 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.680
 You do not like it, do not you? 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.110
 then exceptional should be part of 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.400
 where he questions the swords of 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 and all tals 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 Good. I'll show you. It's even 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
 Normal furnace takes I'll put here 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.260
 just for you to see is one of each of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 I'll just go and see if everyone works, right? 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.060
 There's always one that does not work. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.610
 there you can do it all 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.570
 but I think they all work, yes, everything 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.820
 everything is cool and leaves the government and 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.140
 As always, people move away from 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.650
 people will be in the description there for you 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.500

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.200
 The mold and metallurgy mode always comes with 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.270
