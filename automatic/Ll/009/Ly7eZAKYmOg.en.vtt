00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello to all those coming today we are going to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.090
 teach how to make strawberry jam good 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.910
 so to make a strawberry jam 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.410
 obviously we need strawberry and sugar 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.720
 it is very easy you will see that other recipes 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.050
 in which the use is also recommended 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 of some citrus or something of something 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.540
 liquid so that to create a 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.519
 Candy and no and no caramelice valga 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.400
 the redundancy of sugar in dry and 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.920
 then we stayed, pieces are left 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.080
 of candy to go floating but something 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.270
 it is not necessary what we are going to do is 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.420
 very simple we see that we have 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.340
 picked some strawberries we have removed the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.660
 green part and we have split them in 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.280
 rooms do not have to split the more 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 small then they will drop a lot 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.479
 liquid will reduce and when the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.300
 let's go to anoint, they're going to be undone 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.130
 with which it is not necessary to divide them more 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 we have washed them too and what we are going 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.930
 to do is going to be put in our 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.720
 cooking pot 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 and add the good sugar now to 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.960
 principle we have to be careful 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 let's go around doing a few laps so 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 do not caramelize the sugar and you will see 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.539
 what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
 almost instantaneously it will start to 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.280
 drop the strawberry itself and that's going to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.939
 prevent us from having those problems that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.939
 I commented previously 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 the jams are a great way 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 to also involve the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.960
 kids at home 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.960
 to the kitchen tasks 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 and it's also a very good way to give 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 output to seasonal products 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.580
 could reduce the amount of sugar if 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.560
 it seems to you that this is excessive to put 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.650
 half -weight strawberries put it on 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 sugar but if you're going to make a preserve 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.430
 and you want it to last 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.570
 a year then yes it is convenient that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 vintage jce is at the same proportion of 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.550
 Strawberry 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.550
 but good at the beginning 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.030
 It is important that we go looking for the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.490
 lateral 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.459
 so that those sugar grains that do not 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.990
 they are in contact with the liquid and go down 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.950
 down and do not get caramelized on the wall 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.770
 from the pot is good you see 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.180
 that has already released a lot of liquid what 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.550
 what we are going to do is to lower the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.050
 boil it to a gentle boil and let's 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.840
 to prolong cooking during 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.830
 approximately 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.349
 about 25 minutes let's see what's going to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.720
 get very very very very light liquid 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.150
 but then with the course of the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.990
 cooking will be reduced and will catch 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.360
 a texture and much more of jam 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.819
 well you see twenty-five have passed 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.010
 minutes 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.310
 and we already have the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.659
 we have the marmalade perfectly made 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.220
 now it is a bit liquid but 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.180
 then the moment that reposes will remain 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.730
 with an ideal jam texture like this 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.900
 is that what we are going to do is going to be 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.900
 let it cool and we present 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.269
 well you see one hour has passed 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.090
 we have had refrigerating and here we have 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.620
 our strawberry jam you know what 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.319
 most wonderful color have we are going to 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.319
 present here so you can see it 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.380
 better to camera 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.060
 with its pieces that as I said before 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.060
 they will undo perfectly 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.560
 good and this would be our jam of 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.340
 Strawberry 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.340
 look
