00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
kind of a fool bundesliga team of the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.240 
kind of a fool bundesliga team of the
season<00:00:15.420> team<00:00:15.599> except<00:00:16.049> Muller<00:00:16.350> my<00:00:16.890> mistake<00:00:17.039> was

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
season team except Muller my mistake was

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
season team except Muller my mistake was
I<00:00:17.520> wanted<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.060> review<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> broiler<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> about

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
I wanted to review the broiler and about

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230 
I wanted to review the broiler and about
me<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:19.740> thinking<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.340> would<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.670> extinct

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
me I'm thinking they would be extinct

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000 
me I'm thinking they would be extinct
but<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.840> turns<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.199> Mulder<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
but it turns out Mulder is kind of the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.920 
but it turns out Mulder is kind of the
one<00:00:23.130> extinct<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.609> anyways<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
one extinct so anyways this is a bit of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
one extinct so anyways this is a bit of
a<00:00:25.019> most<00:00:25.260> expensive<00:00:25.769> Bundesliga<00:00:26.310> team<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
a most expensive Bundesliga team now I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
a most expensive Bundesliga team now I
could<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.359> mean<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.900> wanted<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.439> for

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
could have I mean I wanted to go for

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
could have I mean I wanted to go for
Timothy<00:00:28.980> Robin<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.519> Timothy<00:00:29.820> annoyer<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
Timothy Robin and Timothy annoyer but I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.479 
Timothy Robin and Timothy annoyer but I
simply<00:00:31.140> I've<00:00:31.529> already<00:00:31.740> done<00:00:32.009> videos<00:00:32.189> with

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
simply I've already done videos with

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.770 
simply I've already done videos with
them<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.820> thought<00:00:32.969> why<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.630> for

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
them so I thought why not just go for

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
them so I thought why not just go for
the<00:00:33.840> team<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> seasons<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.010> they

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the team of the seasons and see how they

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.620 
the team of the seasons and see how they
are<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.489> squad<00:00:35.910> builders<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.450> also

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
are because squad builders are also

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
are because squad builders are also
taken<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> review<00:00:37.710> sense<00:00:37.980> as<00:00:38.219> well<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.210> um

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
said they seemed a bit sluggish as a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
said they seemed a bit sluggish as a
team<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:36.750> i<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.290> example<00:01:37.939> hazard<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
team and if i had for example hazard and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.740

think it would be more opie but having

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.830 
think it would be more opie but having
them<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.430> together<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.030> didn't<00:01:45.630> click

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
on with the pace back there but for this

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860 
on with the pace back there but for this
team<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.340> season<00:03:40.639> Robin<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.060> thought<00:03:41.720> he

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
team of the season Robin I thought he

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.890 
team of the season Robin I thought he
was<00:03:41.959> amazing<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.639> team<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.449> the<00:03:44.569> annoyer

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
I'm not a fan of a team of the season

I'm not a fan of a team of the season
oil<00:03:46.699> was<00:03:46.910> he<00:03:47.120> was<00:03:47.510> fine<00:03:47.720> he<00:03:47.750> didn't<00:03:48.230> really

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
oil was he was fine he didn't really

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.800 
oil was he was fine he didn't really
intrigued<00:03:49.609> me<00:03:49.699> to<00:03:49.910> be<00:03:50.000> honest<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.419> he<00:03:50.569> did<00:03:50.720> his

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
intrigued me to be honest but he did his

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.360 
intrigued me to be honest but he did his
job<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.260> was<00:03:51.379> most<00:03:51.560> important<00:03:51.980> but<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.160> think

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
job that was most important but I think

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.009
