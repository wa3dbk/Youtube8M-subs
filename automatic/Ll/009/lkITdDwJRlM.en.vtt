he doesn't know is Richie cells
basically<00:01:56.100> useless<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.969> point<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
basically useless at this point so I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
basically useless at this point so I
think<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.680> i<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> rapid<00:01:59.490> spin

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
think right here i go for the rapid spin

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.710 
think right here i go for the rapid spin
as

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
as

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.420 
as
for<00:02:01.020> another<00:02:01.260> Thunder<00:02:01.650> winch<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.010> predicting

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for another Thunder winch is predicting

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.040 
for another Thunder winch is predicting
me<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.580> switch<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.150> i<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.300> get<00:02:03.600> parallax

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
me to switch out but i do get parallax

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.020 
me to switch out but i do get parallax
and<00:02:04.320> no<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.190> right<00:02:05.400> here<00:02:05.460> i<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and no it's right here i go for the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030 
and no it's right here i go for the
rapid<00:02:06.210> spin<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.470> i<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.830> for<00:02:07.980> the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
rapid spin actually so i go for the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.830 
rapid spin actually so i go for the
rapid<00:02:08.280> spin<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.820> he<00:02:08.940> goes<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.240> another<00:02:09.330> done

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
rapid spin as he goes for another done

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.060 
rapid spin as he goes for another done
the<00:02:09.960> way<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> predicting<00:02:10.350> me<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> switch<00:02:10.860> out

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
the way of predicting me to switch out

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.800 
the way of predicting me to switch out
so<00:02:11.400> i<00:02:11.460> do<00:02:11.520> get<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.940> rapid<00:02:12.240> spin<00:02:12.450> off<00:02:12.570> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so i do get the rapid spin off and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.660 
so i do get the rapid spin off and
that's<00:02:12.990> gonna<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.350> away<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.680> South<00:02:13.920> Bronx<00:02:14.130> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that's gonna get away in South Bronx and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.850 
that's gonna get away in South Bronx and
then<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.910> basically<00:02:15.420> died<00:02:15.660> from<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.990> bird<00:02:16.170> so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
then he basically died from the bird so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.470 
then he basically died from the bird so
now<00:02:16.980> he's<00:02:17.100> gonna<00:02:17.220> go<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> shame<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
now he's gonna go to a shame in as I

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.480 
now he's gonna go to a shame in as I
switch<00:02:18.750> off<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.170> go<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:19.500> sis<00:02:19.740> no<00:02:19.920> relax<00:02:20.190> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
switch off and go to my sis no relax and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.120 
switch off and go to my sis no relax and
I'm<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> rest<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.140> believe<00:02:22.440> so

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I'm gonna go for the rest I believe so

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
I'm gonna go for the rest I believe so
he<00:02:23.430> does<00:02:23.580> go<00:02:23.730> feeling<00:02:24.000> lead<00:02:24.150> sheet<00:02:24.390> which<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
he does go feeling lead sheet which is a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.380 
he does go feeling lead sheet which is a
good<00:02:24.930> prediction<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.470> his<00:02:25.680> part<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.730> yeah<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
good prediction on his part so yeah I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.970 
good prediction on his part so yeah I
think<00:02:27.510> I'll<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.050> for<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> rest<00:02:28.440> right<00:02:28.620> here<00:02:28.680> he

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
think I'll go for the rest right here he

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.070 
think I'll go for the rest right here he
goes<00:02:29.100> for<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> seed<00:02:29.550> flare<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.270> almost<00:02:30.840> eight

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
goes for the seed flare and almost eight

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020 
goes for the seed flare and almost eight
smell<00:02:31.320> but<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.680> quite<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.310> my<00:02:32.550> Snorlax

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.240 
predicted to go into this one we're all
right<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.990> since<00:02:49.320> he<00:02:49.560> can't<00:02:49.590> switch<00:02:50.040> out

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
right here and since he can't switch out

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.390 
right here and since he can't switch out
from<00:02:50.550> South<00:02:50.880> rocks<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:53.130> gonna<00:02:53.280> go

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
from South rocks so I'm just gonna go

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040 
from South rocks so I'm just gonna go
into<00:02:53.640> my<00:02:53.730> glass<00:02:53.850> voices<00:02:54.300> i<00:02:54.390> predict<00:02:54.750> him<00:02:54.870> free

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
into my glass voices i predict him free

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.930 
into my glass voices i predict him free
to<00:02:55.260> offer<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> Aquajet<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:56.550> believe<00:02:56.850> he

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
to offer the Aquajet and i believe he

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.820 
to offer the Aquajet and i believe he
did<00:02:57.120> say<00:02:57.300> his<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> rail<00:02:58.170> his<00:02:58.380> choice<00:02:58.620> banded

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
did say his as a rail his choice banded

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.430 
did say his as a rail his choice banded
so<00:02:59.250> he's<00:03:00.030> basically<00:03:00.330> locked<00:03:00.810> into<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
so he's basically locked into the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.220 
so he's basically locked into the
Aquajet<00:03:02.130> which<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.580> perfect<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.110> he's

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
Aquajet which is perfect and now he's

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.660 
Aquajet which is perfect and now he's
going<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.500> back<00:03:04.620> into<00:03:04.830> his<00:03:04.980> shame<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
going to go back into his shame in and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.340 
going to go back into his shame in and
he<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.420> double<00:03:06.810> switches<00:03:07.110> into<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
he actually double switches into a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.440 
he actually double switches into a
chandelier<00:03:07.739> which<00:03:08.100> was<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> good<00:03:08.550> good<00:03:09.030> play<00:03:09.209> on

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
chandelier which was a good good play on

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.870 
chandelier which was a good good play on
his<00:03:09.810> part<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.560> i<00:03:11.040> went<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> my<00:03:11.459> store<00:03:11.700> lines

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
his part and i went to my store lines

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
his part and i went to my store lines
which<00:03:12.060> isn't<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.450> bad<00:03:12.540> but<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:12.930> want<00:03:13.140> to

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200

which isn't that bad but they want to
move<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:13.739> hit<00:03:13.860> him<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.100> his<00:03:14.250> body
