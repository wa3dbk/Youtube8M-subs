00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.680
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.510
 I want you from me today too 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.460
 five more practical ones 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.100
 psychotricks introduce you first of all 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.710
 Run as a team and I think we 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 start directly with the first tweet as 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.669
 First I want you control task 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
 Imagine is free in Cydia 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.130
 available and the control center 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 pull up and here one side to the side 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 pull 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.950
 then we see six in the ios 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 multitask the different apps 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 currently open in multitasking 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 to me it's these five and the daughters 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.710
 just click and then open 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.930
 this really very practical i can 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.460
 also access it from any app 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 by simply using the control center 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 pulling up 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.179
 we still have one 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.629
 setting possibility in the 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.579
 Settings for the tweet control task 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 I just click on I can 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 here still select that this 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.990
 individual roles play a role 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.660
 ask and I can here from the five 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.270
 apps per page otherwise that should be 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.710
 only four that is possible in the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.869
 I find settings very convenient 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 controllers should be on each device 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.610
 be installed every case 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 the next track means front 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.740
 and I open a folder once and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.259
 You definitely see that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.670
 The background is gone like me 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.290
 already with another tweet 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 but this has three 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 functions 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.350
 First of all, then I can go through two 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 just close the folder so finger 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 a pin room klose function and the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 third feature is that in the folder 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.460
 can create another folder 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.219
 I simply count it in the folder 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 another app in the other one 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.680
 folder and I'm coming now 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.930
 Just get out of here and then 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 back in the last years I think 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.409
 quite practical we have in the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.170
 settings the possibility these three 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.390
 activate functions 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 We just click on it then 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.740
 here this first fulda all folders in 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.170
 folder and 4 beck and that can 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.750
 We then depending on what we have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.050
 want to enable and disable 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 So a pretty handy tweak 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.980
 maybe you could do it from the top already 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.230
 see 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.480
 even if I'm not very close yet 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.330
 zoomed in with the trick dogs 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.400
 you see that the individual actions yes 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.110
 shine a little 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.330
 I think now it's still something 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.099
 better to recognize so we see here 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.190
 for example behind the music facebook 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.629
 safari type board in there there lights 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.209
 behind the app it's a lighter 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.739
 shimmer and that's just with logo 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.870
 I think that's quite possible, so I can see it 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.489
 actually quite cool from under 17 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.980
 especially if still in the background 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.280
 then just this talk is displayed 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.290
 this slightly transparent has the whole 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.530
 just a single jaw that in the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.030
 folders some apps also light up 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.440
 but then that's what I think 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.569
 not so bad looks in the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.609
 folder quite chic should, however 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.040
 actually only in the dock next to it 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.690
 the next step is called doubt 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.090
 Maybe some action already from 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.349
 ios 6 known and this tweak 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.480
 makes writing easier for us 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.790
 or correcting texts 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160
 we can do it instead of with 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.680
 the loupe here to look for anything 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.109
 we can just go with it on the keyboard 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.730
 pull our finger back and forth and 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.950
 then the right one accordingly 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.609
 then hike to something 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.099
 correct 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.599
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.250
 a very nice extension around 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.989
 faster to correct something 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.290
 because the magnifying glass is sometimes already 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.599
 quite cumbersome and works too 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.019
 not so good in some apps 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.430
 when i am in safari and i am there 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.590
 under google and would like something there 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.030
 looking then often missing this magnifying glass or 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.680
 does not appear at all or what do I know 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.870
 So there it is still very packed 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.130
 and that works with 2 collection 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.730
 definitely better i can easily 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.590
 Going back and forth is easy and 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.079
 fast and not too big 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.299
 bugs here under ios so i like it 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.030
 quite good is free in cydia 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.590
 available 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.169
 as a last match on a winter board 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.299
 ios six draw him 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.669
 and the whole thing works under 17 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.500
 needs winter board and would have that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.639
 whole then in winterberg active me 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 show you the whole also like 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.280
 Once we get him here in the harvest board 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.099
 and will be here under select him that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.479
 first off so is sexy and that 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.240
 So also works on than me 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.160
 Accused and you see that mine 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.160
 So how, for example, our driver 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.729
 music app then here the setting 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.099
 phone app store itunes store here 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.620
 Photos calendar and so were all 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.419
 so adapted to the camera app videos 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.139
 and so on, really 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.580
 quite a bit is yes how should 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.490
 So I say something looks 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.979
 strangely located under ios 7 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.819
 since we are just this latest 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.560
 have a blog 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.449
 but I think that with a few 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.190
 then update these apps a bit too 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.340
 be customized so that's a little more 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.940
 fits into it but overall find 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.069
 I for all the 17 icons too colorful 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.900
 or too confusing it is up 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.330
 every case a pretty good one 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.490
 team and looks cool too 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.530
 It does not really bother me that that 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.240
 not quite adapted but could 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.659
 but something else was done 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.430
 become 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:31.360
 but overall we asked many 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.860
 whether they also install 16, so to speak 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.259
 Can get back on your device by the 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.449
 jailbreak just about a goal and 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.840
 that's already over this 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.300
 ermotti possible that you were already 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.409
 again my incompatible switzerland for 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.060
