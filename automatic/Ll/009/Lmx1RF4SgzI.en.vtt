00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
triangle form this isn't the best try

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
triangle form this isn't the best try
also<00:01:38.310> draw<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
also draw it on but the this is just a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.399 
also draw it on but the this is just a

book and that's why this is the base of
the<00:04:02.010> triangle<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:03.359> left<00:04:03.540> says<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.989> while

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the triangle the left says that while

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.680 
the triangle the left says that while
there's<00:04:04.500> really<00:04:05.239> these<00:04:06.239> are<00:04:06.299> pretty<00:04:06.540> much

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
there's really these are pretty much

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.099 
there's really these are pretty much
even<00:04:06.959> um<00:04:08.090> well<00:04:09.090> actually<00:04:09.180> he<00:04:09.540> he<00:04:09.810> puts<00:04:09.989> more

the third M is method and this is all

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.220 
the third M is method and this is all
basically<00:05:37.470> technical<00:05:38.310> analysis<00:05:39.020> things<00:05:40.020> like

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
basically technical analysis things like

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
and well I'm not gonna write down the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.600 
and well I'm not gonna write down the
force<00:05:51.180> index<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.200> Eldar<00:05:52.590> impulse<00:05:53.100> system

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
of different things on method he goes

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.260 
of different things on method he goes
over<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.930> lot<00:06:22.080> of<00:06:22.169> classical<00:06:22.710> charting<00:06:23.270> things

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
over a lot of classical charting things

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.290 
over a lot of classical charting things
the<00:06:24.510> arm<00:06:24.690> more<00:06:25.680> so<00:06:25.950> actually<00:06:26.580> in

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
the arm more so actually in

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.570 
the arm more so actually in
trading<00:06:27.539> for<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:27.720> living<00:06:28.080> he<00:06:28.259> goes<00:06:28.440> over<00:06:28.830> a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
trading for a living he goes over a

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.659 
trading for a living he goes over a
classical<00:06:30.389> charting<00:06:31.250> and<00:06:32.250> coming<00:06:32.520> to<00:06:32.580> my

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
classical charting and coming to my

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.649 
classical charting and coming to my
trading<00:06:32.970> room<00:06:33.120> and<00:06:33.240> gets<00:06:33.360> more<00:06:33.509> computerized

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
trading room and gets more computerized

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.559 
trading room and gets more computerized
so<00:06:36.659> that's<00:06:37.110> that's<00:06:37.440> basically<00:06:38.000> this<00:06:39.000> this

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
so that's that's basically this this

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.480 
so that's that's basically this this
triangle<00:06:39.960> just<00:06:40.080> basically<00:06:40.650> sums<00:06:40.949> up<00:06:41.159> all<00:06:41.340> of

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
triangle just basically sums up all of

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.689 
triangle just basically sums up all of
this<00:06:41.690> this<00:06:42.690> goes<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:42.960> very<00:06:43.409> in-depth<00:06:43.979> with<00:06:44.639> a
