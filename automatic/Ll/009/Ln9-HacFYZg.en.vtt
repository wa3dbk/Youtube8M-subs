I think Glomus so should you should glow
nicely<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.540> first<00:02:53.840> watch<00:02:55.690> second

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
nicely so this is the first watch second

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.890 
nicely so this is the first watch second
we<00:02:58.610> have<00:02:59.470> this<00:03:00.490> show<00:03:01.490> no<00:03:01.610> graph<00:03:01.790> diver<00:03:02.030> this

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
we have this show no graph diver this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.790 
we have this show no graph diver this
one<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.230> one<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.740> matters<00:03:05.800> water-resistant

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
one is one that matters water-resistant

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.720 
one is one that matters water-resistant
this<00:03:07.490> one<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.910> 500<00:03:08.210> meters<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.800> it's<00:03:10.190> much<00:03:10.700> more

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
this one is 500 meters so it's much more

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.980 
this one is 500 meters so it's much more
I<00:03:12.550> don't<00:03:13.550> know<00:03:13.850> how<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.290> okay<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:17.270> is<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
I don't know how to okay so this is the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.860 
I don't know how to okay so this is the
crown<00:03:18.260> guard

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
crown guard

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.990 
crown guard
other<00:03:20.870> than<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:22.280> everything<00:03:22.730> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
other than that the everything is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.560 
other than that the everything is
curable<00:03:23.420> as<00:03:23.840> well<00:03:24.110> due<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.190> water<00:03:25.400> proof<00:03:26.330> nurse

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
curable as well due to water proof nurse

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.210 
curable as well due to water proof nurse
so<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.230> first<00:03:27.470> position<00:03:27.620> doesn't<00:03:28.160> do

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
so the first position doesn't do

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.780 
so the first position doesn't do
anything

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
anything

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.140

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
this is quartz movement second change

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.090 
this is quartz movement second change
the<00:03:32.300> date<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:34.100> third<00:03:34.690> change<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.950> autumn<00:03:36.950> oh
