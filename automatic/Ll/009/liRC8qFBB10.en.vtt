00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.239
 Good day to day hello 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.160
 subscribers and guests of my channel today 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 your attention spinning review 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:02.670
 assembled on mpx form with g 9007 and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.100
 six feet long 6 12 l b 1 16 38 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 that is, it is 230 its length 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 and up to three and a half to 10 with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.899
 half a gram so its anyway 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.499
 characterizes Americans it 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.399
 American blank let's say it is very 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:28.259
 popular 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:32.700
 very interesting actually here i would have it 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.459
 characterized let 's say so here it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.189
 real test 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.290
 Well, probably family certificates 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.270
 here 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.890
 it if you don't do small 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 wounded and a small tulip but from 7 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:56.430
 let's say rand 20 to 24 but indisputable 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.500
 Here is the most comfortable him catching it there 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.890
 let's say 10 15 16 to 20 grams that's 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 its like weight 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 it's like this form 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.380
 replica on one of 0 and I don't know 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.660
 replica not replica 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.590
 I do not like its creators 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.590
 talked but very much like one of 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.170
 religions myself I once kept well this is not 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.480
 my build no-no-no-not my not mine 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.670
 I also took the production from a friend 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.060
 but I also collected at least ten of them 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.870
 that is, it is popular with us spinning and 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 legs they catch shorter I was holding 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.440
 two forms in one hand won the river 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.049
 another mkx is the only difference here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.630
 here is the connection at Garik here 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.980
 the bottle but as if so here is wound yes 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.579
 here is still firming and all as well so alone 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.180
 vogue 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.239
 although but I don't know he is not expensive himself 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.769
 the form is worth about 75 dollars there or 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.630
 77 I have dinner at different places in different hits 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.560
 I do not know exactly how much we are from the hall 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.510
 costs but the delivery here is also worth the money 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.880
 how could all sorts of risks therefore 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.120
 us it's worth about but I do not know 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.120
 75 77 dollars is the form itself 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.519
 plus still let's say $ 100 on 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.260
 fittings and the rest for the work of the master 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.920
 Stan but how would everyone decide for 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 yourself what can I say good about 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.439
 this stick she is moderate 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.680
 let's say so even i say so she doesn't 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:46.560
 immoderately she is light 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.989
 Here is the weight of this particular 117 grams 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.590
 I did the same for me too 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.799
 there in the region of 115 120 depending on 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.230
 what the customer wanted what kind of 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.810
 on the handle how much and you hang on it and so 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.200
 further cork well in general it depends on 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.540
 many what katushkoderzhatel here here 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.840
 this one adds weight sit down 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.329
 beautiful so generally he is light 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.180
 very powerful like all Americans 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.509
 that is, there were cases of catching on such 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.330
 spinning like pike eights and she 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:28.500
 wind up the submarine in general tore her 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.949
 there firmly stick very reliable 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:38.430
 jig i'm live sensitive all is well 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:40.919
 three miracles let's say it is more on fire 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.800
 but you can twit and say so grams up 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.599
 seven to eight may be more but 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.750
 The main thing that blair a were not much 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.639
 train and because but violent 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.000
 porous it will fall a little 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.479
 although she will learn to distinguish wand 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.150
 very worthy and let's say so 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:05.010
 budget i think well in a good price 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.599
 categories it turns out slush then in 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.139
 area 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.729
 don't know 200 there with a little dollars 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.849
 stick if it is made especially by 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:19.789
 man that is all she is satisfied 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:23.849
 very good, that is, if anyone wishes 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.770
 Americans sharpened fire let's say so 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.930
 families 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:33.320
 80 to 20-24 grams 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.080
 I'm sorry this is how we would say 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.160
 exactly what is needed 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.840

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.290
