down<00:02:06.920> inside<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.819> you<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.030> start<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.539> see<00:02:08.750> a

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
down inside and you can start to see a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.170 
down inside and you can start to see a
little<00:02:09.049> bit<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.440> calcium<00:02:09.849> starting<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.940> grow

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
little bit of calcium starting to grow

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.449 
little bit of calcium starting to grow
on<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.599> cell<00:02:11.810> plates<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:13.099> what<00:02:13.340> we're

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
on the cell plates that's what we're

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.979 
on the cell plates that's what we're
trying<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> clean<00:02:14.060> off<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> cell<00:02:14.720> for

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
trying to clean off of the cell for

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.440 
trying to clean off of the cell for
optimum<00:02:15.410> performance<00:02:16.120> there's<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.180> couple

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
optimum performance there's a couple

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.060 
optimum performance there's a couple
different<00:02:17.570> ways<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:18.560> clean<00:02:18.859> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
different ways that you can clean the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.900 
different ways that you can clean the
chlorine<00:02:19.459> generator<00:02:19.910> cell<00:02:21.459> what<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.489> like<00:02:22.730> to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
chlorine generator cell what I like to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.360 
chlorine generator cell what I like to
use<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:25.640> an<00:02:25.880> acid<00:02:26.299> cleaning<00:02:26.750> cap<00:02:27.250> basically<00:02:28.250> it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
use is an acid cleaning cap basically it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.650 
use is an acid cleaning cap basically it
looks<00:02:28.519> just<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.000> compression<00:02:29.480> fitting

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
looks just like the compression fitting

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.110 
looks just like the compression fitting
but<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.530> has<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> cap<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.310> end<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.880> an

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
but it has a cap on the end of it and an

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.580 
but it has a cap on the end of it and an
o-ring

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
o-ring

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.479 
o-ring
so<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.799> we<00:02:33.920> do<00:02:34.239> what<00:02:35.239> we<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.350> screw<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
so what we do what we do is we screw the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.810 
so what we do what we do is we screw the
cap<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.540> one<00:02:38.750> end<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:40.130> generator<00:02:40.519> cell

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
cap on to one end of the generator cell

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.809 
cap on to one end of the generator cell
and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.410> can<00:02:42.590> set<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:43.100> generator<00:02:43.519> cell

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
and then we can set the generator cell

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:52.520 
and then we can set the generator cell
down<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.019> surface

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.770 

then<00:02:53.530> what<00:02:53.770> we<00:02:53.890> do<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.820> take<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> mixture<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
then what we do is we take a mixture of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.100 
then what we do is we take a mixture of
muriatic<00:02:56.530> acid<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.280> water<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:58.690> fill<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
muriatic acid and water and we fill the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.460 
muriatic acid and water and we fill the
cellar<00:02:59.380> never<00:03:00.190> more<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> strength<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.540> 50/50

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
cellar never more to a strength of 50/50

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.230 
cellar never more to a strength of 50/50
always<00:03:03.400> want<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.580> have<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> little<00:03:03.910> bit<00:03:04.060> more

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
always want to have a little bit more

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.630 
always want to have a little bit more
water<00:03:04.480> than<00:03:04.900> acid<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.220> always<00:03:06.340> want<00:03:06.610> to

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
water than acid and you always want to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.660 
water than acid and you always want to
start<00:03:06.880> with<00:03:07.120> your<00:03:07.240> water<00:03:07.480> first<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:09.580> I'll

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
start with your water first so what I'll

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.290 
start with your water first so what I'll
do<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.480> will<00:03:10.510> take<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.960> water<00:03:12.030> pour<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.180> into

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
do is I will take the water pour it into

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:22.460 
do is I will take the water pour it into
the<00:03:13.570> cell<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:16.510> approximately<00:03:17.170> 60%<00:03:17.680> full<00:03:21.240> and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the cell to approximately 60% full and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.960 
the cell to approximately 60% full and
then<00:03:23.470> what<00:03:23.620> I'll<00:03:23.710> do<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:23.890> I'll<00:03:24.160> take<00:03:24.190> muriatic

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
then what I'll do is I'll take muriatic

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.110 
then what I'll do is I'll take muriatic
acid<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.510> dump<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.590> into<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.070> cell<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.910> top

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
acid and dump that into the cell to top

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.770 
acid and dump that into the cell to top
it<00:03:31.300> off

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.300 

you

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.619 

now<00:03:43.310> we're<00:03:43.519> going<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.700> let<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:43.969> chemicals<00:03:44.450> do

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
now we're going to let the chemicals do

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.709 
now we're going to let the chemicals do
the<00:03:44.780> work<00:03:45.609> you<00:03:46.609> come<00:03:46.819> over<00:03:46.969> and<00:03:47.180> take<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> look

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
the work you come over and take a look

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.940 
the work you come over and take a look
you'll<00:03:47.900> have<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.049> little<00:03:48.260> bit<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.499> smoke<00:03:48.920> coming

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
you'll have a little bit of smoke coming

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.640 
you'll have a little bit of smoke coming
out<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.969> the<00:03:50.209> water<00:03:50.450> will<00:03:50.659> begin<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.079> boil<00:03:51.499> in

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
out and the water will begin to boil in

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.259 
out and the water will begin to boil in
there<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.040> basically<00:03:52.579> what<00:03:52.790> it's<00:03:52.939> doing<00:03:52.969> is

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
there and basically what it's doing is

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.229 
there and basically what it's doing is
its<00:03:53.389> eating<00:03:53.719> all<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> calcium<00:03:54.200> scale<00:03:54.889> off<00:03:55.239> of

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
its eating all the calcium scale off of

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.670 
its eating all the calcium scale off of
the<00:03:56.480> plates<00:03:57.109> inside<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.769> chlorine<00:03:58.099> generator

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
the plates inside the chlorine generator

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.569 
the plates inside the chlorine generator
this<00:04:00.680> will<00:04:00.859> take<00:04:01.069> anywhere<00:04:01.370> from

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
this will take anywhere from

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.270 
this will take anywhere from
approximately<00:04:02.409> two<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.709> ten<00:04:03.920> minutes

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
approximately two to ten minutes

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.250 
approximately two to ten minutes
depending<00:04:04.639> on<00:04:05.000> your<00:04:05.060> last<00:04:05.389> cleaning<00:04:05.780> cycle

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
depending on your last cleaning cycle

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.530 
depending on your last cleaning cycle
this<00:04:07.250> is<00:04:07.459> something<00:04:07.819> that<00:04:07.969> should<00:04:08.209> be<00:04:08.239> done

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
this is something that should be done

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.470 
this is something that should be done
every<00:04:08.889> 90<00:04:09.889> days<00:04:09.919> is<00:04:10.760> when<00:04:10.969> you<00:04:11.090> should<00:04:11.239> clean

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
every 90 days is when you should clean

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:29.980 
every 90 days is when you should clean
this<00:04:11.659> generator<00:04:12.109> cell

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
reaction with the calcium that's when

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.310 
reaction with the calcium that's when
you<00:04:38.510> know<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:38.810> cell<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.350> clean<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:42.230> looks

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
you know your cell is clean it looks

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.350 
you know your cell is clean it looks
like<00:04:42.530> we<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.910> approximately<00:04:43.910> fifteen<00:04:44.240> or

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
like we have a approximately fifteen or

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:59.660 
like we have a approximately fifteen or
twenty<00:04:44.630> more<00:04:44.750> seconds

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.250 

what<00:05:00.670> I<00:05:00.700> generally<00:05:00.970> do<00:05:01.360> when<00:05:01.390> we<00:05:01.720> get<00:05:01.840> done<00:05:02.050> is

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
what I generally do when we get done is

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.020 
what I generally do when we get done is
I'll<00:05:02.380> take<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.740> acid<00:05:03.100> water<00:05:03.250> mixture<00:05:03.730> and

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
I'll take the acid water mixture and

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.540 
I'll take the acid water mixture and
I'll<00:05:04.300> dump<00:05:04.480> it<00:05:04.630> into<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:04.840> bucket<00:05:05.110> or<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:06.400> can

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
I'll dump it into a bucket or you can

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.710 
I'll dump it into a bucket or you can
take<00:05:06.730> it<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:06.970> dump<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.240> back<00:05:07.270> into<00:05:07.600> the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
take it and dump it back into the

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.560 
take it and dump it back into the
swimming<00:05:07.930> pool<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.970> water<00:05:09.970> has<00:05:10.270> pretty<00:05:10.480> much

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
swimming pool the water has pretty much

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.440 
swimming pool the water has pretty much
become<00:05:10.870> non<00:05:11.710> bubbling<00:05:12.250> anymore<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.180> what<00:05:13.330> I'm

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
become non bubbling anymore so what I'm

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.730 
become non bubbling anymore so what I'm
going<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.630> do<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.110> I'm<00:05:14.260> going<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.410> take<00:05:14.560> the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
going to do is I'm going to take the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.520 
going to do is I'm going to take the
acid<00:05:15.160> water<00:05:15.700> out<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.120> cell<00:05:16.390> and<00:05:17.260> I'm<00:05:17.410> going

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
acid water out of the cell and I'm going

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.050 
acid water out of the cell and I'm going
to<00:05:17.620> dump<00:05:17.770> it<00:05:17.890> into<00:05:18.040> a<00:05:18.130> bucket<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:20.730> now<00:05:21.730> you<00:05:21.790> can

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
to dump it into a bucket and now you can

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.790 
to dump it into a bucket and now you can
look<00:05:22.240> down<00:05:22.420> in<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.750> cell<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.320> can<00:05:23.500> see

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
look down in the cell and you can see

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.960 
look down in the cell and you can see
that<00:05:23.980> there's<00:05:24.130> no<00:05:24.280> more<00:05:24.460> calcium<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:25.030> there

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
that there's no more calcium in there

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.280 
that there's no more calcium in there
now<00:05:27.970> what<00:05:28.150> I'm<00:05:28.270> going<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.420> do<00:05:28.630> is<00:05:28.870> I'm<00:05:29.110> going<00:05:29.230> to
