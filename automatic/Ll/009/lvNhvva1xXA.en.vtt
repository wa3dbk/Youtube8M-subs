00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.069
 hey people today we talk about the three 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.340
 prices in the nyckelharpa 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 wave line we once have the nike 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.089
 fell the most on a window 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.710
 and in a field 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.449
 all three shoes are different 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 both from the material as well as from the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.180
 prices ago 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 We always talk about normal 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.580
 selling price here we have 220 euros 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
 here we have 75 euros and have here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.810
 the price entrance with 55 euro the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.120
 biggest differences of all 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.880
 Football boots take the material instead 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 that means stay maika band phantom 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.200
 I have a very soft mike skin 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.379
 material that the error comes from a 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.539
 harder but still very soft 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.940
 imitation leather material and the fed sets 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.399
 then on a full synthetic material 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 which has a smooth surface 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.030
 whereas the phantom and the precipitation 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 A slight deepening came here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.880
 a new conditions three times for use 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.430
 in the field that makes even more that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.490
 that the ball in every weather condition 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.720
 I also really hope you can 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 So best of all, maybe see that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.220
 fendt another yet another well 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.830
 another organ editions 3 system has 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
 as the precipitation as I said in the field 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 it is not used at all 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.369
 What all three shoes have 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 main feature of the distributor wave line 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.710
 the shortened lacing is the one 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.409
 additional contact area offers one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 Enlarged contact surface offers the is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.670
 to find again at all 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.159
 also sets the very cheap 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.770
 version already on a laterally offset 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.659
 school system which otherwise with many 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 techno version other manufacturers not 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.880
 The case is another characteristic 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.799
 can be found on the bottom of the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.430
 soccer shoes 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.440
 just turn everything around 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.090
 and at first glance would have 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.420
 be clear where the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 differences are to be found we have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 the nike at my father 's his fans 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.360
 puts on the split 1000 the split 1000 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.120
 in the front area is meant for 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.570
 the forefoot too flexible 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 do 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.460
 the filling and the fade put on 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 this system does not have the film for it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.720
 however, afford the appropriate for 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.610
 a special flexibility on care 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.120
 should also be durable if for 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.300
 use comes in the very cheap fayed 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.060
 the price entry you see missing this 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.709
 Sole the two pillars of the first two 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.650
 mentioned shoes differ 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.860
 relatively little it is the splinter sum 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.450
 of which makes the difference in the field 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.730
 afterwards the difference is already 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.540
 a little bit bigger there is another zone 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 to use the more for hard 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.410
 A little harder ground is meant 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.340
 for you can see also from here 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.330
 brought further central location 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.730
 and thus they differ 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 football boots but clearly 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.130
 main difference of my personal 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.400
 opinion is less the lower zone 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.290
 than much the upper material I have 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.410
 basically recommend the shoes on 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.630
 a dry to slightly wet 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.510
 background otherwise would be from the phantom 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.130
 In any case, the sg pro version on 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.760
 a really soft underground the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.709
 you have a better choice in the end 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.019
 of course the choice to which school you 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.489
 should put or which shoes too 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.980
 are the right ones for someone 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.750
 maybe you can so again the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810
 Difference in the material s.besten 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.540
 see as I said my opinion is the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.209
 main day is clearly that nike 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.890
 skin material in the field what in schools 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.200
 which we really excellent 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.930
 gives fit and finn comfort 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.510
 speak you have with us in the shop the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.459
 choice between all three schools and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.830
 I would just care what is 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.560
 favorite with the football boots for 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.750
 which you decide why and 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.190
 yes let me know on facebook 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.190
