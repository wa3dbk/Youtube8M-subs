00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello no it's victoria 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.540
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.349
 to roll so I kept the same 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.380
 material to know a semi reel 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:23.750
 automatic of areli lucane 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.550
 nine feet fault 4 and wf so that's 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.559
 much easier to roll them 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.720
 with a summer why because all 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:32.269
 the point of the silk is on 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.949
 the front so the movement is very 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:39.409
 simple so once you do you 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.149
 start with a few to throw and a 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.989
 straight ahead 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.780
 you do not have to go very far 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.019
 you go to 4.5 m you go out a little bit of 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.750
 self 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.940
 you just have to bring the can 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.790
 these one hour from my angel a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.030
 calving the amplitude of the silk that makes 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.030
 all 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.770
 just one inch is the ferment of 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.239
 send it forward and from you 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.519
 Stop 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.670
 between 9am and 10am so I'm going to 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.500
 show the movement here planned so there 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.960
 I'm sorry, I 'm bringing my evening 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.940
 quite gently behind me that she did not 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.150
 an hour it is necessary that calais however 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.780
 this audition a shot straight closes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.920
 in front by lowering the can between 9 and 10 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.420
 hours 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 I accompany the otherwise ask 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.479
 here 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.210
 so I'm going to get away a bit from the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.130
 camera you have more touched here 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.060
 so I start my gesture with blows 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.479
 rights 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.479
 it's classic 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 still the faith of their themes 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.710
 so 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.710
 glass of wine 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.060
 the map behind 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.860
 dependent 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.740
 it's not just behind you 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.520
 our country 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 Gale 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.090
 more wind to go out a little you a 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.090
 time I am 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 and there it goes all alone you sell 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.090
 antisect on the nose 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.750
 sapa 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.390
 canvas and up to fifteen meters 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.810
 in this way and take out the silk 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 I shoot 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.720
 if I rolled 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.230
 we saw all 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.890
 is possible 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.890
 so that you can 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.680
 sin correctly forehands the 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.120
 setback is 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.830
