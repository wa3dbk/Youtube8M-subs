00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.720 
ride has the low-rise rocker shape on
this<00:00:32.330> board<00:00:32.629> so<00:00:32.840> basically<00:00:33.230> from<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.280> contact

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
this board so basically from the contact

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.520 
this board so basically from the contact
point<00:00:35.030> all<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.570> way<00:00:35.660> down<00:00:35.870> through<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.260> tail

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
point all the way down through the tail

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.920 
point all the way down through the tail
contact<00:00:37.129> point<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.940> have<00:00:38.059> a<00:00:38.090> flat<00:00:38.420> stable

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
contact point you have a flat stable

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.549 
contact point you have a flat stable
platform<00:00:39.260> okay<00:00:39.949> then<00:00:40.900> maybe<00:00:41.900> about<00:00:42.199> here<00:00:42.530> I

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
platform okay then maybe about here I

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.170 
platform okay then maybe about here I
think<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.949> is<00:00:43.070> you<00:00:43.190> have<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.309> low-rise<00:00:43.850> rocker

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
think it is you have a low-rise rocker

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.810 
think it is you have a low-rise rocker
that<00:00:44.570> kicks<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:45.079> up<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.440> kicks<00:00:46.040> these<00:00:46.220> contact

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
that kicks it up and kicks these contact

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.030 
that kicks it up and kicks these contact
points<00:00:47.180> right<00:00:47.329> here<00:00:47.390> up<00:00:47.660> out<00:00:47.930> of<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.170> snow<00:00:48.230> now

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
points right here up out of the snow now

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.860 
points right here up out of the snow now
I'm<00:00:49.760> not<00:00:49.910> going<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.120> throw<00:00:50.270> an<00:00:50.360> exact<00:00:50.630> figure

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
I'm not going to throw an exact figure

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.510 
I'm not going to throw an exact figure
on<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.200> but<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:51.620> definitely<00:00:51.800> enough<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.430> it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
on it but it's definitely enough that it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.970 
on it but it's definitely enough that it
gets<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:52.880> up<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.210> out<00:00:53.450> so<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.809> way<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.410> you're

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
gets it up and out so that way as you're

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.740 
gets it up and out so that way as you're
kind<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.250> screwing<00:00:55.579> around<00:00:55.700> in<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.120> snow<00:00:56.450> you

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
kind of screwing around in the snow you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.540 
kind of screwing around in the snow you
can<00:00:57.230> shift<00:00:57.469> around<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.100> you're<00:00:58.219> not<00:00:58.340> going<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
can shift around and you're not going to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.310 
can shift around and you're not going to
get<00:00:58.670> hung<00:00:58.879> up<00:00:59.030> by<00:00:59.180> your<00:00:59.300> contact<00:00:59.780> points<00:01:00.170> and

get hung up by your contact points and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.869 
get hung up by your contact points and
that's<00:01:00.649> really<00:01:00.860> important<00:01:01.309> especially<00:01:01.370> in<00:01:01.700> on

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
that's really important especially in on

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.660 
that's really important especially in on

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
hanging up is better because you don't

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
late-night session so that's a huge

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.180 
late-night session so that's a huge
feature<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.840> there<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.200> stable<00:01:15.800> flat

platform<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.060> between<00:01:17.479> feet<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.929> one<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
platform in between feet is one of the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.499 
platform in between feet is one of the
things<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.920> love<00:01:19.220> about<00:01:19.250> ride<00:01:19.759> guards<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.300> most

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
though because that stable platform

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.880 
though because that stable platform
allows<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.929> just<00:01:24.080> race<00:01:24.440> down<00:01:24.740> the

mountain at high speeds it carves well

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.020 
mountain at high speeds it carves well
and<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.709> don't<00:01:27.890> get<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.039> washy<00:01:28.550> rocker

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
nice medium flex to it as well so you

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.550 
nice medium flex to it as well so you
can<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:43.640> play<00:01:43.819> around<00:01:43.959> take<00:01:44.959> advantage<00:01:45.440> of

slimewalls

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.410 
slimewalls
they<00:01:57.739> dampen<00:01:58.160> out<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.310> feeling<00:01:58.819> you<00:01:59.239> don't

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
they dampen out the feeling you don't

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.900 
they dampen out the feeling you don't
get<00:01:59.539> as<00:01:59.660> much<00:01:59.780> vibration<00:02:00.410> running<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.069> flexes

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
get as much vibration running it flexes

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.760 
get as much vibration running it flexes
more<00:02:02.450> naturally<00:02:03.020> with<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.259> board<00:02:03.590> than<00:02:03.739> a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
more naturally with the board than a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.550 
more naturally with the board than a
traditional<00:02:04.239> ptex<00:02:05.239> sidewall<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:05.959> underfoot

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
traditional ptex sidewall so underfoot

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.830 
traditional ptex sidewall so underfoot
and<00:02:06.800> now<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.880> flexes<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.479> entire

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
and now as it flexes the entire

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.260 
and now as it flexes the entire
effective<00:02:09.590> edge<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.310> entire<00:02:10.610> slimewall

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
effective edge and the entire slimewall

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.150 
effective edge and the entire slimewall
flexes<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.560> even<00:02:12.770> much<00:02:12.920> more

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
flexes with you so even much more

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.770 
flexes with you so even much more
natural<00:02:13.580> feeling<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.940> can<00:02:14.090> feel<00:02:14.420> where<00:02:14.660> your

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
natural feeling you can feel where your

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.570 
natural feeling you can feel where your
edges<00:02:15.170> are<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.130> helps<00:02:16.489> when

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
edges are and that really helps when

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.680 
edges are and that really helps when
you're<00:02:16.700> sliding<00:02:16.910> rails<00:02:17.239> when<00:02:17.569> you're

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
you're sliding rails when you're

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
you're sliding rails when you're
spinning<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.739> other<00:02:18.860> thing<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.190> they're

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
spinning and the other thing is they're

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.860 
spinning and the other thing is they're
durable<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.030> hell<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.719> can<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.170> nail

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
durable as hell you can just nail

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.479 
durable as hell you can just nail
these<00:02:22.019> things<00:02:22.230> into<00:02:22.500> rails<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.129> stumps

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
these things into rails and the stumps

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.640 
these things into rails and the stumps
and<00:02:23.580> stuff<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:24.060> day<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.959> polyurethane

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and stuff all day and this polyurethane

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
and stuff all day and this polyurethane
is<00:02:25.739> not<00:02:25.920> chipping<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:26.849> not<00:02:27.090> doing

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
is not chipping that's not doing

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
is not chipping that's not doing
anything<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.799> boards<00:02:29.099> gonna

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
anything like that so your boards gonna

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.309 
anything like that so your boards gonna
last<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.730> lot<00:02:29.879> longer<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.049> cleave

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
last a lot longer and then the cleave

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.410 
last a lot longer and then the cleave
edge<00:02:31.590> runs<00:02:32.129> into<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.549> as<00:02:32.730> well<00:02:32.879> because<00:02:33.239> it's

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
edge runs into that as well because it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.770 
edge runs into that as well because it's
50%<00:02:33.900> thicker<00:02:34.379> than<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> traditional<00:02:35.780> metal

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
50% thicker than a traditional metal

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.509 
50% thicker than a traditional metal
edge<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.379> what<00:02:37.530> that's<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.890> do<00:02:38.099> for<00:02:38.129> you

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
edge so what that's going to do for you

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.550 
edge so what that's going to do for you
is<00:02:38.940> most<00:02:39.269> people<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.780> edge<00:02:39.989> problems

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
is most people have edge problems

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.069 
is most people have edge problems
because<00:02:40.950> you're<00:02:41.519> sliding<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.120> metal<00:02:42.480> rail<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
because you're sliding a metal rail and

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.930 
because you're sliding a metal rail and
then<00:02:43.560> you're<00:02:43.709> landing<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.159> cold<00:02:44.370> snow<00:02:44.670> that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then you're landing in cold snow that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.140 
then you're landing in cold snow that
friction<00:02:45.390> heats<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:45.959> your<00:02:46.200> edge<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:48.060> you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
friction heats up your edge and when you

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.390 
friction heats up your edge and when you
hit<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.299> cold<00:02:48.720> snow<00:02:49.019> there<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.829> chance<00:02:50.190> of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
hit that cold snow there is a chance of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.890 
hit that cold snow there is a chance of
cracking<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.150> when<00:02:51.299> your<00:02:51.420> mom<00:02:51.569> used<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
cracking it's like when your mom used to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
cracking it's like when your mom used to
tell<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.409> put<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.739> hot<00:02:52.980> pan<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
tell you don't put that hot pan in the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.729 
tell you don't put that hot pan in the
sink<00:02:53.489> after<00:02:53.970> frying<00:02:54.720> something<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.530> can

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
sink after frying something up it can

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.479 
sink after frying something up it can
crack<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.609> having<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.000> 50%<00:02:57.690> thicker<00:02:58.489> cleavage

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
crack so having a 50% thicker cleavage

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.150 
crack so having a 50% thicker cleavage
metal<00:03:00.390> edge<00:03:00.569> here<00:03:00.989> you're<00:03:01.530> less<00:03:01.680> likely<00:03:01.709> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
metal edge here you're less likely to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.309 
metal edge here you're less likely to
have<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.579> happen<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:03.959> you're<00:03:04.230> gonna

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
have that happen to you and you're gonna

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.050 
have that happen to you and you're gonna
get<00:03:04.560> more<00:03:04.769> longevity<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> board

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
get more longevity out of the board

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.240 
get more longevity out of the board
durability<00:03:07.049> wise<00:03:07.230> as<00:03:07.590> you're<00:03:07.799> doing<00:03:07.950> those

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
durability wise as you're doing those

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.479 
durability wise as you're doing those
sessions<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.970> park<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.370> your
