00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 It is difficult to talk about crises when they are 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.990
 fifths of the general table but the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.059
 america lost three games 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.090
 consecutive in the Aztec stadium and is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.450
 to six points only from the sotaneros 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.609
 generals veracruz and monterrey then 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 there are crises or not the eagles accept their 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 guilt they say that in this nothing has to 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 see the Turkish mohamed 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
 marcelino fernández del castillo cuatro 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.689
 defeats in the last five games 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 the red lights have turned on in america 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 more not to make drastic decisions 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 but to do an analysis of things 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.390
 that has stopped making the equipment that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 they prevent players from having regularity 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.059
 assume responsibility and exempt their 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 technician of the losing streak living 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 we had the advantage of two goals in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.110
 against saints we did not know how to keep it there 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.289
 it is not missing having that balance 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.570
 that we were having that we were doing 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.090
 goals and they did not make us now we're not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.510
 doing and they make us mohamed is a great 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 great technician a great person that he 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 He knows that he is the least guilty 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 because we are on the court 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.480
 we are the ones who play those who 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.280
 we have 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.500
 things so that the team comes out to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.510
 Float the team passes and the players 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 also by gusts at times and maybe 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.410
 a bit too much but we know that party 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.610
 to match and date after date we have the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.670
 possibilities of reversing it 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 so let's hope everyone together this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.150
 it's not about individuals that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.680
 all together we can take to that level 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.180
 that we all want 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.280
 raúl jiménez discards that the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.410
 Americanists are thinking more about the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.480
 world that on your computer and says be 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.580
 conscious that having been the basis of 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.400
 tricolor does not guarantee a position in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.050
 Brazil, well, I do not know, I think you have to 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.910
 they have the edition is my girls only 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.979
 we are the ones we have been 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.940
 been and we have been called to the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.860
 This selection would try to get out of that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 bump to not generate those doubts 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 but let me know that I've been here 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 two years with me working no no I 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.229
 insure opposite I have to follow 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.500
 trying to keep trying to get me 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.479
 the worst possible goals I and three in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.040
 eight parties at this point 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.140
 so I find it has not happened it seems 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.630
 then if you have to be stuck 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.150
 aware that we must do more 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.100
 goals to make the call at the end 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 the training of this Tuesday antonio 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.730
 mohamed had a talk 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.380
 approximately 10 minutes with Juan 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.989
 carlos el topo valenzuela y adrián 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.820
 aldrete meanwhile raúl jiménez said 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.270
 the first objective is to classify and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.370
 split 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.570
 the league will be another story in the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.340
 City of Mexico- Marcelino Fernández 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.160
 of the castle and it's fine 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.230
 marcelino thank you in the first five 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 dates of the 2014 clause the america 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.069
 accumulated 12 units thanks to four 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.019
 victories and a defeat seven goals a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.879
 favor and two against but in the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.629
 last five dates the eagles have 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.120
 three points just for a win and four 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.450
 you defeat five goals in favor and it's in 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.450
 against
