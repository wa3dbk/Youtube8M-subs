00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 well we are here with the one with manuel 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.960
 we are talking about a base in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 particular that we are seeing and wanted 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.179
 show them or tell them everything is a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.429
 little for him after super 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 interesting is a theme of santana it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.560
 Europa flame is an old theme of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.560
 constant 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.930
 towards original things 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.410
 and this topic has the peculiarity of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.860
 that has a ballad flavor is less but 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 in a moment the guy ends the round 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.460
 in C major it is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.170
 that 's the famous modulation there 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.989
 it was only agreed after magazines 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.750
 but without bad chain unless you do 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.220
 that change also allows you to measure the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.340
 minor harmonic other movement mÃ©tele 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.860
 tritone meter 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.450
 that is, it is very open to harmony as 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 it seems a lot of things but what I 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.040
 interesting is that you see the issue of change 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 modal from least to greatest in the type applies 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.580
 but it's not that he applies it from this 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.410
 guitar but that is applied in the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.640
 concept of composition in harmony 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.370
 then this brings us to a point 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 interesting that I want to show you today 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:21.360
 it is almost more important what compose 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 harmonically down that what I'm going to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.890
 touch up 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 if you grab a great guitar solo 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 awesome as it can be the first 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.580
 single of confortably numb of pink floyd and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 you play it alone without harmony is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.960
 spectacular but does not have the drama 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.880
 what do you have if you take it up on the subject not 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.940
 I know how important is how they fit the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 pieces and many times what you 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.240
 like a guitarist is not so much the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 guitarist itself but creativity 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 that has the type to harmonize below 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.070
 of the playing part are me or their 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.990
 bandmates 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 then in this case in this case of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.690
 santana 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.180
 let's hear that I'm going to improvise 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.550
 above the theme of europe so you can see 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.530
 how you can work up in harmony 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.540
 which is so interesting and I recommend you 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.160
 that if you can do it, do it and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.160
 apply this concept in your band 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.140
 is 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 plus 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.250
 and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 Y 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.700
 Y 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.210
 yes 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.060
 look 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 and 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.910
 yes 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.310
 yes 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.540
 Y 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.540
 ah 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.590
 and good 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.530
 yes 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.130
 mmm 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.949
 all right 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.080
