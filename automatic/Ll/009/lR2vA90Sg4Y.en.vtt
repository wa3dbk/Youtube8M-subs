00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.220
 good morning friends in his club are 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.740
 Alessandro in front of us 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.190
 you can see the galaxy 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:16.420
 is the new end mobile phone 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.010
 amazon in style galaxy s3 is now so 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.810
 the design 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.810
 which will probably change in the future 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.420
 when you arrive in this smartphone 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.930
 of low- end precisely has a processor 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.930
 1 gb is a ram 512 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.310
 despite having characteristics 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.130
 rather escarpment hardware we have a 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:49.300
 3.5-inch display and a resolution 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.560
 hvg in spite of effects among other things 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 we have almost all 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.950
 functions that we also find in the four 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.460
 years 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.260
 of course multiview etc. sorry 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 if sometimes pop ups appear but 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.200
 there is an active demo with you then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.180
 we are unable to remove it as 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.260
 you can see we already have the function 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.200
 relating to the same or cellular 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.470
 see we 're watching it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.930
 so you should not go into the block 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.240
 we have all the animations 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.659
 related the most varied touchwiz 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.500
 beautiful that we are used to find in 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.440
 new galaxy 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.980
 but see the drop-down menu as you can 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.340
 see now we have in all this 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.409
 custom curtain with the various in 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.899
 this rapid sony existed 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.789
 this is the classic menu they are 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.360
 used to find in android 4 against 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.040
 1 against 2 c 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.620
 the dimensions and we are talking about a device 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 rather small compact 113.20 61.6 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.369
 for a fairly high thickness though 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.990
 precisely and compact of 11.55 minimums 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.900
 rather discreet battery to a thousand 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.330
 300 million per hour while the camera 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.420
 5 megapixel rear with flash 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.459
 games 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.550
 we tried it for a few seconds 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.770
 seems to be rather fluid as well 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.819
 memory so great work from the point 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.819
 of view of the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 the optimization we put you do 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 see a keyboard for a moment 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.120
 ok 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 as you can see I have not had 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.760
 a hesitation despite being a keyboard 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.069
 very small 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.610
 the touch is great for now we don't have 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.569
 vibration feedback because we have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.420
 disabled 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.909
 but it's really a great central key 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.260
 which serves to activate in multitasking e 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.639
 it works great we got to 57 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.650
 applications without details 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.790
 thieves we need memory management 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.909
 ram 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 etcetera etc. the photos I make myself 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.459
 immediately see a discussion of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.459
 camera 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.860
 here it is 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.349
 I gave 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.659
 camera which also presents 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.190
 the car maybe took a picture of me 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.670
 we can then move on to the gallery 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.030
 via the key 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.030
 I have dedicated 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.530
 which are discrete 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.860
 we have nothing in particular 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.540
 system keys beyond the account the 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.940
 physical key we have the two soft keys 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.040
 touch a to the side of the button as immediately 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.610
 other samsung balance rocker a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.610
 left 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
 the phone lock release button 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.500
 on the top right we have both the 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.540
 territory 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.000
 the back cover is to remove the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:23.000
 battery is the 3.5 mm jack for the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.680
 microphone plus micro usb connector 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.020
 that now a good phone should 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.850
 to arrive shortly 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.480
 large Italian distribution to a 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.660
 really low price we should 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.110
 find around 200 euros 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.110
 I want them
