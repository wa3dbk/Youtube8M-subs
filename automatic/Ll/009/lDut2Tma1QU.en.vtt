00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.570 

I've<00:00:01.530> just<00:00:01.709> pinned<00:00:01.949> out<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> piece<00:00:02.550> of

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
I've just pinned out a piece of

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480 
I've just pinned out a piece of
watercolor<00:00:02.939> paper<00:00:03.149> here<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.560> I'm<00:00:05.220> just<00:00:05.279> going

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
watercolor paper here and I'm just going

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.240 
watercolor paper here and I'm just going
to<00:00:05.549> block<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.509> painting<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.799> start<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
to block in a painting the start of the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.700 
to block in a painting the start of the
painting<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> bones<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.410> show<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
painting the bones of it and show you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.980 
painting the bones of it and show you
how<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.010> process<00:00:11.340> happens<00:00:11.910> but<00:00:12.059> we'll<00:00:12.240> come

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
how that process happens but we'll come

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.660 
how that process happens but we'll come
back<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.259> five<00:00:13.469> minutes<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.980> I'll<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.280> halfway

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
back in five minutes and I'll be halfway

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.380 
back in five minutes and I'll be halfway
through<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.160> blogged<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.090> really

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
through it so just blogged in really

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.779 
through it so just blogged in really
really<00:00:18.510> quickly<00:00:18.869> roughly<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> shapes<00:00:20.189> where

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
really quickly roughly the shapes where

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.759 
really quickly roughly the shapes where
I<00:00:20.820> want<00:00:21.090> everything<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.449> go<00:00:21.660> we'll<00:00:22.619> let<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I want everything to go we'll let that

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.689 
I want everything to go we'll let that
dry<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.100> five<00:00:23.490> minutes<00:00:23.820> I'll<00:00:24.269> put<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> coat<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
dry for five minutes I'll put a coat of

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
dry for five minutes I'll put a coat of
impasto<00:00:26.699> gel<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.180> binder<00:00:28.140> medium<00:00:28.260> or

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
impasto gel or binder medium or

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.390 
impasto gel or binder medium or
something<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
something like that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970 
something like that
fascinating<00:00:30.090> fixer<00:00:30.510> over<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.080> top<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.529> lock

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
fascinating fixer over the top to lock

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
fascinating fixer over the top to lock
it<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.719> I'll<00:00:33.989> start<00:00:34.260> building

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it all in and then I'll start building

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.069 
it all in and then I'll start building
all<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.760> highlights<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.450> shadows<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
all the highlights and shadows and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.680 
all the highlights and shadows and
details<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.219> I've<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.730> reestablished<00:00:39.570> all

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
details so I've just reestablished all

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
details so I've just reestablished all
these<00:00:39.899> colors<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.440> again<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.370> just

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
these colors here again and I've just

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.209 
these colors here again and I've just
put<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:41.910> these<00:00:42.450> dark<00:00:42.780> areas<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
put in some these dark areas but as you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
put in some these dark areas but as you
can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.730> dark<00:00:44.969> areas<00:00:45.239> they're<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.719> be

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
can see these dark areas they're just be

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
can see these dark areas they're just be
black<00:00:46.379> blobs<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> middle<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
black blobs in the middle of the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
black blobs in the middle of the
painting<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.360> I've<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.719> try<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:48.930> do

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
painting so what I've got to try and do

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
painting so what I've got to try and do
is<00:00:49.260> create<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.800> depth<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:51.059> dimension

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is create some depth and some dimension

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
is create some depth and some dimension
in<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> two

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
in there I'm going to use the two

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
in there I'm going to use the two
principles<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.780> talked<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.399> shadows<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
principles I talked about shadows in and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
principles I talked about shadows in and
shadows<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.739> we'll<00:00:58.920> run<00:00:59.070> some<00:00:59.129> shadows<00:00:59.699> on

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
shadows on so we'll run some shadows on

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.529 
shadows on so we'll run some shadows on
the<00:01:00.180> sand<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.100> some<00:01:02.100> shadows<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the sand here and some shadows in the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:25.460 
the sand here and some shadows in the
foliage

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770 

so<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:26.560> putting<00:01:26.980> my<00:01:27.160> shadows<00:01:27.580> on<00:01:27.970> something

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
so I'm putting my shadows on something

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.780 
so I'm putting my shadows on something
now<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:28.990> that's<00:01:29.320> creating<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.980> plains<00:01:30.310> of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
now and that's creating the plains of

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.420 
now and that's creating the plains of
the<00:01:30.970> ground<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.570> by<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.350> way<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.530> paint<00:01:32.950> them<00:01:33.220> I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the ground and by the way I paint them I

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.260 
the ground and by the way I paint them I
can<00:01:33.730> create<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.510> impression<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.290> ground

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can create the impression of the ground

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.360 
can create the impression of the ground
the<00:01:37.270> shape<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.840> ground<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.710> if<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.220> look

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
the shape of the ground and if you look

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.730 
the shape of the ground and if you look
really<00:01:39.550> closely<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.990> background<00:01:41.440> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
really closely in the background here

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.250 
really closely in the background here
I'm<00:01:41.920> doing<00:01:42.100> some<00:01:42.400> more<00:01:42.550> shadows<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:44.110> I've

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
I'm doing some more shadows but I've

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.190 
I'm doing some more shadows but I've
added<00:01:44.530> actually<00:01:45.040> some<00:01:45.250> blue<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.730> that<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:47.050> it's

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
added actually some blue to that so it's

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.720 
added actually some blue to that so it's
a<00:01:47.290> little<00:01:47.320> bit<00:01:47.560> blue<00:01:47.800> up<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.310> look<00:01:48.460> closer

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
a little bit blue up if you look closer

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.390 
a little bit blue up if you look closer
and<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:50.230> creates<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.860> impression<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:53.400> these

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
and that creates the impression of these

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.770 
and that creates the impression of these
shadows<00:01:54.790> being<00:01:55.120> further<00:01:55.420> away<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.540> I'll<00:01:58.630> make

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
shadows being further away so I'll make

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.660 
shadows being further away so I'll make
them<00:01:58.990> warmer<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.740> less<00:02:03.010> blue<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.550> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
them warmer and less blue in the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.990 
them warmer and less blue in the
foreground<00:02:04.030> here<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.070> keep<00:02:06.250> them<00:02:06.430> quite<00:02:06.670> blue

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
foreground here and keep them quite blue

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.100 
foreground here and keep them quite blue
out<00:02:07.210> there<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.410> will<00:02:08.560> make<00:02:09.899> look<00:02:10.899> like

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
out there and that will make look like

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.710 
out there and that will make look like
they're<00:02:11.320> further<00:02:11.530> away<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> put<00:02:13.240> my<00:02:13.360> shadows

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
they're further away so I put my shadows

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.830 
they're further away so I put my shadows
on<00:02:13.990> here<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> creates<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:16.030> plane<00:02:16.360> here

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
on here and that creates this plane here

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.980 
on here and that creates this plane here
now<00:02:17.620> at<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:17.920> nice<00:02:18.190> dark<00:02:18.520> area<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.960> I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
now at this nice dark area in here but I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.050 
now at this nice dark area in here but I
want<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> give<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.530> some<00:02:20.710> depth<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.880> what<00:02:22.000> I'm

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
want to give it some depth so what I'm

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.100 
want to give it some depth so what I'm
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.240> do<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.630> I'm<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.930> introduce

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
going to do is I'm going to introduce

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.480 
going to do is I'm going to introduce
some<00:02:24.300> color<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.690> there<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.770> that's<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.070> nice

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
some color in there so that's just nice

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.949 
some color in there so that's just nice
kind<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.239> bluey<00:02:28.480> green<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.170> color<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:31.540> create

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
kind of bluey green in color now create

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.640 
kind of bluey green in color now create
some<00:02:32.230> depth<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.800> shadows<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.820> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
some depth in the shadows like that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.420 
some depth in the shadows like that
do<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.770> same<00:02:36.010> over<00:02:36.220> here<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.470> creates

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
do the same over here and that creates

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.520 
do the same over here and that creates
the<00:02:42.640> illusion<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.390> shadows<00:02:43.720> receding<00:02:44.410> off

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
the illusion of the shadows receding off

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.280 
the illusion of the shadows receding off
all<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.489> that's<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.300> receding<00:02:46.870> off<00:02:46.989> in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
all this that's and receding off in

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.490 
all this that's and receding off in
underneath<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.920> trees<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> what<00:02:50.140> I've<00:02:50.260> done

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
underneath the trees so what I've done

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.900 
underneath the trees so what I've done
too<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.920> I've<00:02:51.040> put<00:02:51.250> started<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> put<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
too is I've put started to put the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.630 
too is I've put started to put the
highlights<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.650> edges<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:53.980> these<00:02:54.250> leaves

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
highlights on the edges of these leaves

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.460 
highlights on the edges of these leaves
I'm<00:02:55.360> not<00:02:55.570> going<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> worry<00:02:55.900> about<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.260> too

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
I'm not going to worry about that too

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.080 
I'm not going to worry about that too
much<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:56.890> because<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.250> want<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.430> show<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.700> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
much now because I want to show you a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.990 
much now because I want to show you a
way<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.720> making<00:02:59.230> these<00:02:59.410> shadows<00:03:00.000> giving

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
way of making these shadows giving

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.420 
way of making these shadows giving
putting<00:03:01.480> some<00:03:01.660> depth<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.050> those<00:03:02.230> shadows<00:03:02.470> so

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
putting some depth in those shadows so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.370 
putting some depth in those shadows so
light<00:03:03.760> filters<00:03:04.209> through<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.570> trees<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.200> I'm

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
light filters through the trees so I'm

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.690 
light filters through the trees so I'm
just<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.770> use<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.070> edge<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.400> brush

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
just going to use the edge of my brush

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.949 
just going to use the edge of my brush
like<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.570> create<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.410> impression<00:03:08.650> that

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
like that and create the impression that

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.180 
like that and create the impression that
lights<00:03:10.959> coming<00:03:11.290> through<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.800> hitting<00:03:12.100> these

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
lights coming through and hitting these

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.430 
lights coming through and hitting these
branches<00:03:12.870> here<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.020> there<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.780> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.670 

same<00:03:20.070> over<00:03:20.250> here<00:03:21.230> because<00:03:22.230> what<00:03:22.380> I've<00:03:22.500> done

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
same over here because what I've done

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.930 
same over here because what I've done
here<00:03:22.920> normally<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.310> would<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.460> painted<00:03:23.790> all

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
here normally I would have painted all

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.910 
here normally I would have painted all
the<00:03:24.030> water<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.450> everything<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.960> but<00:03:25.830> I'm

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the water and everything in but I'm

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.830 
the water and everything in but I'm
actually<00:03:26.070> moving<00:03:26.430> right<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:26.820> straight<00:03:27.660> away

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
actually moving right here straight away

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
actually moving right here straight away
into<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.200> shaded<00:03:28.620> area<00:03:28.770> I'll<00:03:29.400> come<00:03:29.610> back<00:03:29.700> and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
into that shaded area I'll come back and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.790 
into that shaded area I'll come back and
get<00:03:29.940> all<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.090> later<00:03:30.500> because<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.560> want<00:03:31.740> to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
get all that later because I want to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.010 
get all that later because I want to
illustrate<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.610> few<00:03:32.850> points<00:03:33.240> so<00:03:33.840> what<00:03:33.900> we're

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
illustrate a few points so what we're

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.000 
illustrate a few points so what we're
going<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> do<00:03:34.320> now<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.530> I'm<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.770> put<00:03:34.860> some

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
going to do now is I'm going to put some

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.880 
going to do now is I'm going to put some
flashes<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.550> color<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> shadows<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:36.890> to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
flashes of color in the shadows just to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.680 
flashes of color in the shadows just to
show<00:03:38.130> how<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.460> can<00:03:38.670> put<00:03:38.880> unexpected<00:03:39.510> color

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
show how you can put unexpected color

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690 
show how you can put unexpected color
too<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.080> want<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.890> imagine<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.370> lights

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
too I want you to imagine that lights

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.490 
too I want you to imagine that lights
filtering<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.570> through<00:03:42.600> under<00:03:43.020> those<00:03:43.140> leaves

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
filtering in through under those leaves

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.460 
filtering in through under those leaves
and<00:03:43.800> it's<00:03:44.400> reflecting<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.120> blue<00:03:45.300> sky<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.290> we

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
and it's reflecting the blue sky so we

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.560 
and it's reflecting the blue sky so we
put<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> few<00:03:46.920> little<00:03:47.430> flecks<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:50.240> blue<00:03:51.240> in<00:03:51.360> there

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
put a few little flecks of blue in there

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.610 
put a few little flecks of blue in there
here<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.020> there<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:53.750> don't<00:03:54.750> know<00:03:54.900> if<00:03:54.960> you<00:03:55.470> can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
here and there I don't know if you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.710 
here and there I don't know if you can
see<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:59.300> like<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:01.970> there's<00:04:02.970> always<00:04:03.180> some

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
see that like that there's always some

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.670 
see that like that there's always some
dead<00:04:04.500> leaves<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:05.540> couple<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.600> branches<00:04:06.870> light

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
dead leaves a couple of branches light

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.850 
dead leaves a couple of branches light
hits<00:04:07.950> something<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.370> weird<00:04:08.580> way<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:10.650> there's<00:04:10.830> a

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
hits something a weird way so there's a

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.879 
hits something a weird way so there's a
little<00:04:11.040> bit<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.160> orange<00:04:11.340> there

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.929 

like<00:04:19.819> that<00:04:21.159> lights<00:04:22.159> filtered<00:04:22.699> through<00:04:22.909> the

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:22.939 
like that lights filtered through the

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:24.939 
like that lights filtered through the
trees<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.509> it's<00:04:24.110> hitting<00:04:24.319> a<00:04:24.620> couple<00:04:24.830> of

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
trees and it's hitting a couple of

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.939 
trees and it's hitting a couple of
leaves<00:04:25.189> here<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.580> there<00:04:27.129> like<00:04:28.129> that<00:04:29.349> and<00:04:30.349> of

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
leaves here and there like that and of

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.350 
leaves here and there like that and of
course<00:04:31.189> it's<00:04:31.400> hitting<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.819> of<00:04:31.849> that<00:04:31.969> grass

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.610 

growing<00:04:35.360> underneath<00:04:35.810> there<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.110> scraggly

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
growing underneath there that scraggly

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.429 
growing underneath there that scraggly
stuff

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:42.439 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.649 

like<00:04:43.219> that<00:04:45.189> of<00:04:46.189> course<00:04:46.369> that<00:04:46.729> lovely<00:04:47.389> white

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
like that of course that lovely white

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.109 
like that of course that lovely white
sand<00:04:48.080> here<00:04:48.439> lights<00:04:49.099> kind<00:04:49.369> of<00:04:49.429> filter<00:04:49.729> through

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:50.119 
sand here lights kind of filter through

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.059 
sand here lights kind of filter through
the<00:04:50.779> leaves<00:04:51.019> and<00:04:51.379> hit<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.099> sand<00:04:52.339> in<00:04:53.149> there

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
the leaves and hit the sand in there

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.459 
the leaves and hit the sand in there
none<00:04:55.069> of<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:55.309> trees<00:04:55.929> but<00:04:56.929> it's<00:04:57.050> also<00:04:57.169> going<00:04:57.409> to

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
none of the trees but it's also going to

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.619 
none of the trees but it's also going to
strike<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.889> branch<00:04:58.279> every<00:04:59.119> now<00:04:59.239> and<00:04:59.389> then<00:04:59.479> on

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
strike a branch every now and then on

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:00.959 
strike a branch every now and then on
the<00:04:59.719> way<00:04:59.839> through

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
the way through

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.669 
the way through
just<00:05:01.969> using<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.389> edge<00:05:02.509> of<00:05:02.659> the<00:05:02.719> brush<00:05:02.869> it's

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:03.679 
just using the edge of the brush it's

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:17.740 
just using the edge of the brush it's
going<00:05:03.739> to<00:05:03.889> hit<00:05:04.009> some<00:05:04.159> of<00:05:04.219> that<00:05:04.279> grass

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.150 

and<00:05:18.750> there<00:05:18.900> we<00:05:18.990> have<00:05:19.139> it<00:05:19.229> very<00:05:19.470> very<00:05:19.650> simple

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
and there we have it very very simple

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.870 
and there we have it very very simple
but<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.340> can<00:05:20.610> see<00:05:20.819> here<00:05:21.090> look<00:05:21.590> shadows<00:05:22.590> on

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
but you can see here look shadows on

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.040 
but you can see here look shadows on
creating<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:23.940> shapes<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.539> sand<00:05:24.780> dunes

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
creating the shapes of the sand dunes

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.480 
creating the shapes of the sand dunes
and<00:05:25.259> I'll<00:05:25.380> tidy<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.800> up<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:26.009> little<00:05:26.099> bit<00:05:26.250> later

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
and I'll tidy that up a little bit later

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.529 
and I'll tidy that up a little bit later
on<00:05:27.080> shadows<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.490> put<00:05:29.759> flashes<00:05:30.180> of<00:05:30.300> color

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
on shadows in and I put flashes of color

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.850 
on shadows in and I put flashes of color
in<00:05:30.720> there<00:05:30.900> to<00:05:31.020> give<00:05:31.169> them<00:05:31.289> some<00:05:31.500> depth<00:05:31.710> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
in there to give them some depth and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.339 
in there to give them some depth and
dimension<00:05:32.509> when<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:33.539> finish<00:05:33.930> this<00:05:34.080> painting

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
dimension when I finish this painting

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.890 
dimension when I finish this painting
I'll<00:05:34.590> tidy<00:05:35.009> that<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.340> up<00:05:35.460> properly<00:05:35.789> but<00:05:36.780> it

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
I'll tidy that all up properly but it

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.300 
I'll tidy that all up properly but it
gives<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:37.259> illusion<00:05:37.349> of<00:05:37.800> depth<00:05:38.069> and

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
gives you the illusion of depth and

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.159 
gives you the illusion of depth and
dimension<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.849> can<00:05:39.060> show<00:05:39.300> how<00:05:39.569> much<00:05:39.810> color

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
dimension and can show how much color

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.200 
dimension and can show how much color
you<00:05:40.410> can<00:05:40.590> put<00:05:40.740> into<00:05:40.889> your<00:05:41.130> shaded<00:05:41.550> areas<00:05:41.910> we've

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
you can put into your shaded areas we've

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.600 
you can put into your shaded areas we've
got<00:05:42.419> a<00:05:42.599> bluish<00:05:43.440> shadowy<00:05:43.800> out<00:05:44.009> here<00:05:44.250> coming

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
got a bluish shadowy out here coming

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.700 
got a bluish shadowy out here coming
through<00:05:44.639> to<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.000> purple<00:05:45.509> which<00:05:45.720> flashes<00:05:46.349> reds

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
through to a purple which flashes reds

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.060 
through to a purple which flashes reds
and<00:05:46.889> blues<00:05:47.130> everything<00:05:47.789> in<00:05:47.910> there<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.830> anyway

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
and blues everything in there so anyway

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
there we have it just a very quick

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.339 
there we have it just a very quick
explanation<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.690> things<00:05:54.930> that<00:05:55.199> we've

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
explanation of the things that we've

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.400 
explanation of the things that we've
written<00:05:55.560> about<00:05:55.889> on<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:57.240> explore<00:05:57.690> acrylic

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
written about on the explore acrylic

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.200 
written about on the explore acrylic
painting<00:05:58.740> website<00:05:58.889> that'll<00:05:59.460> be<00:05:59.550> a<00:05:59.580> shadows

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
painting website that'll be a shadows

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.589 
painting website that'll be a shadows
painting<00:06:00.570> page<00:06:01.849> there<00:06:02.849> should<00:06:03.030> be<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.180> few<00:06:03.449> bits

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
painting page there should be a few bits

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.409 
painting page there should be a few bits
and<00:06:03.720> pieces<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.169> haven't<00:06:04.470> covered<00:06:04.620> here

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
and pieces I haven't covered here

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.249 
and pieces I haven't covered here
hopefully<00:06:06.419> between<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.870> two<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:07.139> those

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
hopefully between the two of those

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.639 
hopefully between the two of those
things<00:06:07.560> you<00:06:07.710> can<00:06:07.830> make<00:06:07.949> some<00:06:08.160> sense<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.580> this
