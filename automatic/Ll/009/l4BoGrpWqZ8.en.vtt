 welcome to a new video by the 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:05.620
 channel 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.269
 or what we will be seeing 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.120
 basically, how to open the ports of 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.120
 pro evolution soccer '2015 I started not 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.720
 first of all let's go to the folder 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.330
 of mind has shown our pro 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.039
 evolution soccer 'and open the file 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 settings 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.539
 I do not have open here 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.830
 there it goes 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 we have the tabs let's go online 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 automatic is made with a popcorn 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.390
 so they are going to distill it they are going to leave it like this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.780
 how are they going to copy 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.050
 the number in this case says 57 and in all 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.050
 says the same 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.860
 and we give him ok 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.860
 we stop the start control panel 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 but like windows 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 Advanced configuration 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.830
 we close here 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.100
 what are we going to do with the configuration 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.340
 advanced what we are going to do is add 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 some new rules 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.260
 there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.220
 and there because it will be perfectly 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.220
 let's go entry rules 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.900
 and we are going to put here cost and be new 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.900
 rule was cut but 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 or the new rule right we set new 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 ruler 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 says what kind of rule you want to create 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.670
 we see add a port so we put 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.350
 ports we're going to next of that game 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.630
 of stick to create one of each 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 that first tcp that we do stick the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.350
 port that we choose we are going to next 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.219
 allowed next connection all here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.140
 by marked next that we compose 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.659
 Well 2015 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.179
 one 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.179
 Perez 2015 to finish 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.920
 what we are going to do now is add 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.200
 another new rule 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.700
 we repeat the next port process 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.250
 but at this moment what are we going to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.650
 do is change to bp we already have a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.250
 sad created now vp ports 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.830
 specific paste next multi the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.430
 Connection 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.959
 we mark the three again a man 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.359
 this is by the name that you 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.349
 want if I'm putting this to 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.349
 identify it in this way 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.180
 the view 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.340
 and we have 32 and it is one created now we are going 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.810
 to go to the exit rule and we're going to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.620
 proceed to do the same 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.640
 new rule port next port 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.910
 specific we paste next and allow 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.910
 the connection 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.320
 another one of marked at three 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.320
 Well 2015 departure 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.069
 1 and we finish and come back with another 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.780
 rule and exit port 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.780
 let's say if this should be web 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:26.060
 will allow connection 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.060
 to three if we put the 2015 output 2 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.930
 and there goes 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.730
 as we see we have quality 1 output 2 and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.730
 entrance 1 and entrance 2 we have up 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.470
 the meat 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.950
 but they are what you have left the game 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.950
 open it 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.950
 if they want, they leave us 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.180
 You're going to that function works the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 game with some ports what 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.080
 we sign, we do not 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.319
 and good with this since it ends the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 tutorial but that has helped them if 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.040
 they have to configure the ports inside 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.250
 of the modem that is apart from this go the same 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.410
 they have to look for tutorial then according to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.230
 what is your model are not all 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.300
 equal models of software that have 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.340
 the routers 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.489
 good to everything for now 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.750
 if it serves you only with a like subscribe 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.990
