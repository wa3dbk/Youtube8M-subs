00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.710
 an exercise derived from the 125 m test 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.430
 in the qg in the position 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.119
 after twelve his bed or table 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.829
 and we just ask him to hold 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.439
 in that position 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.929
 for three minutes for men and four minutes for women 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.989
 which is considered normal then we can start with the parliament a 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:23.670
 ultimate 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
 and then little by little the mans 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.310
 weeks 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.699
 we arrive at 9 o'clock to do 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 three minutes 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 for a few minutes 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.400
 for a little bit more so why 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.350
 so strengthen his muscles i 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 because without tonic muscles that is to say a little like the wings of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 the migratory bird that allow to last longer 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.180
 here I am in a starting position 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.000
 for the radio waste test which is the equivalent for the abdominals of this 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.239
 that we come to see us for the dorsal so the subject must go out 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.170
 derived from this test is not exactly to test its derivatives it must be that the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.880
 more 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.150
 his for two minutes let me opposition 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.220
 or so this position if 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 for a minimum of two minutes 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.090
 here to work his muscles 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 tonic 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 the man last a long time 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 so judge them of earthly life would not go too much my reward block the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.740
 breathing for patients 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700
 because otherwise you have 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.360
 facts 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.660
 it's quite usual that I'm going to block their breathing and I'm stopping 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.480
 because he is asphyxiated and not because he is tired so she 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.710
 so continues long-lasting 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.040
 it is important not to 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.870
 blocked 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 ventilation 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.369
 petanque we get to the end of course we did not do both 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.010
 minutes but you have to start each year 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.350
 this strong progression in the north in the middle very gradually proposes 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 gently people blame me 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 and perched in the ham sales stand 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.760
 compulsory rest as much rest time and working time 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 so here are the firefighters 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.759
 a classic exercise it is necessary to keep our rights it is doped the artists one 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.450
 try to have your back in a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.529
 more position 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.099
 the clip as far 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.939
 so settle in six others 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.939
 accustomed hall of classical gymnastics 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.329
 another topic a specialist go belga peace is not a voice 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 with this contribution after having developed m 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.749
 a real exercise of gymnastics place a head the work of the abdominals 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.559
 we would attend 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.559
 safe 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.669
 with the muscles of the shot also 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.969
 on the assumption that the duration of work elsewhere 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.559
 we can also do 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.319
 if the goal of the sunset it costs us a little painful we can make that 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.149
 go 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 workers and is sent by management to take 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.859
 exercise 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.239
 why work the extensor muscles of the muscles of entremont bel 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.799
 air 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 so just do a little more diligent potty 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.899
 the subject lifted the glutes 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 in fact abdominal breathing poured at the same time 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.020
 also avoid contacting his hamstrings, that is to say the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.459
 muscles that make you take it as if he wanted to bring 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.829
 the stallion of his glutes so as to achieve a small 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.939
 fraction at the same time the level of the lumbar spine 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.999
 so command the next two 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.669
 inspired tummy tummy 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.819
 raise third countries 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.649
 tight heels 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.649
 to classes 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.979
 we are suffering 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.489
 carlos tevez a good series of thirty 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.969
 the day now to contract 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.479
 the flexor muscles of the knee as if we wanted to bring the heels closer to 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.479
 seats 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.599
 but exercise says of the body politic 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.759
 with feet under the stairs where the scarf the Norman wardrobe 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.969
 heyer always with abdominal breathing poured 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 to lead Tehran demand by this exercise 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.340
 it's a resource exercise 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.039
 and the green circle 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.039
 progression what can one ask to stay in the position 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.770
 same time bigger and bigger 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.909
 of course since the muscles of the Swiss 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.360
 without muscles 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 we can also do series like that you know about thirty artists 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 in development 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.439
 in the exercise of adapted squatters 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.439
 back school 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.349
 to let the parents pressure that I save in this position then he 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.349
 longed for and for peace he was lying 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.589
 and the senses 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.059
 and then it has to be true with all the back was very good and 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.059
 perfectly straight 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.469
 to do this you have to have data then on the bar of plunderer 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.650
 where is dead 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.779
 opening 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.120
 he expects a good thirty times that increases 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.529
 the circulation 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.749
 very very importantly 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.439
 but how 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.990
 we can see it 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.770
 by the neck that increase during this series of exercises
