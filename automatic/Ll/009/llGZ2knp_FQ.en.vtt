00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
going for the no heat kind of thing but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
going for the no heat kind of thing but
to<00:01:45.689> start<00:01:45.930> off<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.950> took<00:01:47.100> some

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to start off this I just took some

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.480 
to start off this I just took some
section<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> hair<00:01:48.180> from<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> side<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.500> my<00:01:50.220> part

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
section of hair from the side of my part

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.800 
section of hair from the side of my part
that<00:01:50.670> had<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> least<00:01:51.180> amount<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> hair

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that had the least amount of hair

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
that had the least amount of hair
because<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.740> thought<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:52.920> looks<00:01:53.220> better

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because I just thought that looks better

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.550 
because I just thought that looks better
and<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:53.939> you're<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> grab<00:01:55.140> three

flat<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.319> then<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.859> just<00:03:19.040> split<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.579> ponytail

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
flat and then I just split the ponytail

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.400 
flat and then I just split the ponytail
down<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.540> middle<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:21.290> like

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
down the middle so that it's like

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.710 
down the middle so that it's like
luminous<00:03:22.220> on<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> sides<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.420> tease

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
luminous on the sides and then I tease

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080 
luminous on the sides and then I tease
that<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.230> add<00:03:24.409> more<00:03:24.769> volume<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.879> is

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
that to add more volume and that is

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 
that to add more volume and that is
literally<00:03:26.480> all<00:03:26.780> there<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.680> it's

my other tutorial that had the braid and
I<00:04:12.760> just<00:04:13.060> do<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:13.300> because<00:04:13.780> that's<00:04:14.530> like

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
I just do this because that's like

what's all over tumblr and I think it

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.479 
what's all over tumblr and I think it
looks<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> nicest<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.200> my<00:04:17.320> opinion<00:04:17.800> and<00:04:18.280> so

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
looks the nicest in my opinion and so

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.530 
looks the nicest in my opinion and so
you're<00:04:18.610> just<00:04:18.640> gonna<00:04:18.850> repeat<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.360> same

part<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.120> larger<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.810> then<00:05:08.230> you're<00:05:08.350> just

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
part is larger and then you're just

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.840 
part is larger and then you're just
gonna<00:05:08.560> get<00:05:08.800> three<00:05:09.040> sections<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.700> would

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
gonna get three sections like you would

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.760 
gonna get three sections like you would
for<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.030> regular<00:05:10.360> braid<00:05:10.630> but<00:05:11.140> then<00:05:11.350> just<00:05:11.560> start

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
for a regular braid but then just start

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.500 
for a regular braid but then just start
braiding<00:05:11.980> one<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.520> sections<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.150> decided

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
braiding one of the sections I decided

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.570 
braiding one of the sections I decided
to<00:05:13.720> braid<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.140> middle<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.680> this<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.430> gonna

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
to braid the middle and this is gonna

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.610 
to braid the middle and this is gonna
create<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:16.000> really<00:05:16.300> cool<00:05:16.330> textured<00:05:17.050> look<00:05:17.260> when

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
create a really cool textured look when

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.000 
create a really cool textured look when
you<00:05:17.770> braid<00:05:18.070> all<00:05:18.250> three<00:05:18.550> together<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.590> after<00:05:20.980> I

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
you braid all three together so after I

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.400 
you braid all three together so after I
tie<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.340> one<00:05:21.610> off<00:05:21.850> I'm<00:05:22.240> just<00:05:22.510> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:23.170> take

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
tie that one off I'm just going to take

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.230 
tie that one off I'm just going to take
all<00:05:23.620> three<00:05:23.860> sections<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.460> just<00:05:24.490> do<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:24.970> normal

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
all three sections and just do a normal

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.130 
all three sections and just do a normal
braid

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
then I'm going to tie that braid off and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.530 
then I'm going to tie that braid off and
take<00:05:34.560> off<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.190> other<00:05:35.490> elastic<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.360> like

take off the other elastic that like

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.720 
take off the other elastic that like
little<00:05:36.780> purple<00:05:37.080> one<00:05:37.260> that<00:05:37.560> was<00:05:37.740> attached<00:05:38.490> to

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
little purple one that was attached to

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.070 
little purple one that was attached to
the<00:05:39.570> smaller<00:05:39.930> braid<00:05:40.260> that<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.470> first<00:05:40.860> did<00:05:42.080> and

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
the smaller braid that I first did and

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.300 
the smaller braid that I first did and
then<00:05:43.260> of<00:05:43.380> course<00:05:43.650> we're<00:05:43.920> just<00:05:43.950> going<00:05:44.250> to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
then of course we're just going to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.410 
then of course we're just going to
loosen<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.670> because<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.090> just<00:05:45.210> makes

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
loosen it because that just makes

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.820 
loosen it because that just makes
everything<00:05:45.690> better<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.230> as<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.470> can<00:05:46.590> see<00:05:46.680> my

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
everything better and as you can see my

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.470 
everything better and as you can see my
legs<00:05:47.010> were<00:05:47.130> coming<00:05:47.430> out<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:47.790> I<00:05:48.000> didn't<00:05:48.390> think

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
legs were coming out but I didn't think

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.790 
legs were coming out but I didn't think
it<00:05:48.600> looked<00:05:48.660> too<00:05:48.930> bad<00:05:49.110> I<00:05:49.140> thought<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.560> made<00:05:49.680> it

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
it looked too bad I thought it made it

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.490 
it looked too bad I thought it made it
look<00:05:49.890> kind<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.250> bohemian<00:05:50.540> so<00:05:51.540> that<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:52.050> for
