 examined your comments and the next 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.650

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 other species expect it after 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.460
 prevention and for the weekend we introduced 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.860
 discount promotion 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.799
 here actually now it has already begun 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.020

 monday it's all news now 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.930
 I have a small lyrical digression 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 which is related to yours with yours 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.220
 if questions about armas and how 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 Who forms a list of Armasovs 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.020
 why they are so formed and constant 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 I want this phrase and I think it is necessary 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 so you do differently what I wanted 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.920
 would say that the company work in 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:27.220
 Generally serious professionals who 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:27.220
 yes what seconds are dear friends 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.000
 happens here in the team work 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.400
 exclusively professionals and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.709
 professionals who understand red 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 how it works with numbers we see graphics 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.970
 your buyers abilities we see 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 what goods are bought more often which less often 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.050
 some will say more with less 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.840
 how do they fit and so on and from 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.100
 this we conclude that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 really will be in demand 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.799
 and there is one nuance 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.320
 You are dear players see the reaction 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.340
 the community which is actually 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.560
 reaction of 5 and 20 percent of the total mass 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.340
 players so naturally when you do it 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.130
 see you make certain output in 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.230
 the game is a lot of players who 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.989
 do not respond to our sales in the store 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.840
 pour out this reaction to the forum in contact 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.480
 or anywhere else so their opinions for 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.060
 you remain completely hidden but she 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.360
 visible for 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.140
 us by analyzing their purchasing 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.060
 abilities and their purchases so i'm very 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.700
 I understand that 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.950
 fact actually it sounds like your 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.230
 opinion is not important for us it is not so we 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.599
 we absolutely understand what percentage 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.420
 is the opinion of those who write on 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.769
 forum about any of our promotions to this 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.980
 opinion, we also listen 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.170
 we analyze therefore the request to express 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.870
 your criticism constructively if you 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.360
 just want to put your opinion on 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.780
 certainly very commendable but add in 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.890
