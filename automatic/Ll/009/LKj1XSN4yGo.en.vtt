00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
disposal unit so let's see how it works

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.609 
disposal unit so let's see how it works
we<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:17.910> by<00:00:18.060> dropping<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:18.750> any<00:00:18.990> trash<00:00:19.439> we

we can start by dropping in any trash we

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.820 
we can start by dropping in any trash we
have<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.550> dog<00:00:21.119> poop<00:00:21.420> they're<00:00:21.830> hitting

have like some dog poop they're hitting

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.310 
have like some dog poop they're hitting
the<00:00:22.920> button<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.570> disposed<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> as

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the button and it will be disposed of as

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
the button and it will be disposed of as
you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> can't<00:00:26.130> pick<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.609> blah<00:00:27.119> blah

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you can see I can't pick it up blah blah

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
you can see I can't pick it up blah blah
blah<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.630> gone<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.769> rid<00:00:28.830> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
blah it's gone so you can get rid of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.580 
blah it's gone so you can get rid of
your<00:00:29.010> junk<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.550> easily<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:31.230> can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
your junk really easily so you can

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
your junk really easily so you can
probably<00:00:31.830> guess<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.579> uses<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> cactus<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
probably guess that it uses a cactus to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
probably guess that it uses a cactus to
break<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> items<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> throw<00:00:35.489> your<00:00:35.640> items

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
break the items so you throw your items

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.430 
break the items so you throw your items
on<00:00:35.969> top<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> iron<00:00:36.570> pressure<00:00:36.840> plate<00:00:37.110> which

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
on top of the iron pressure plate which

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430 
on top of the iron pressure plate which
of<00:00:37.620> course<00:00:37.649> cannot<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.190> open<00:00:38.670> by<00:00:38.879> hand<00:00:39.320> as<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
of course cannot be open by hand as you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.889 
of course cannot be open by hand as you
can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.180> use<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> button<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can see you have to use the button so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.209 
can see you have to use the button so
it's<00:00:43.079> safe<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.010> won't

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it's safe you know you won't

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
it's safe you know you won't
accidentally<00:00:44.760> throw<00:00:45.000> anything<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
accidentally throw anything out and you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
accidentally throw anything out and you
basically<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.010> hit<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> button<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.850> opens

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
basically just hit the button it opens

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
basically just hit the button it opens
the<00:00:48.660> items<00:00:48.989> fall<00:00:49.200> into<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> cactus<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> break

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the items fall into the cactus and break

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
the items fall into the cactus and break
and<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.680> how<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> build

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and that's it so let's see how to build

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
and that's it so let's see how to build
it<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> pretty<00:00:53.489> self-explanatory<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it it's pretty self-explanatory but you

it it's pretty self-explanatory but you
might<00:00:55.020> need<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> guide<00:00:56.270> we're

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
might need a little bit of a guide we're

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
might need a little bit of a guide we're
gonna<00:00:57.360> start<00:00:57.600> by<00:00:57.719> digging<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> hole<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.620> looks

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
gonna start by digging a hole that looks

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
gonna start by digging a hole that looks
something<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.190> this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
something like this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.380 
something like this
