rods<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.580> today<00:00:18.020> that<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
rods and I have one here today that I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.970 
rods and I have one here today that I
like<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.680> guys<00:00:20.390> I<00:00:21.680> guess<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> first

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
like to show you guys I guess the first

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.349 
like to show you guys I guess the first
thing<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.400> notice<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.210> bit

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
thing you notice it's a little bit

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.310 
thing you notice it's a little bit
different<00:00:24.779> as<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> handle<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:26.840> this<00:00:27.840> handle

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
different as the handle here this handle

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.820 
different as the handle here this handle
is<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.710> made<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.490> carbon<00:00:29.789> fiber<00:00:30.240> or

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
is actually made out of carbon fiber or

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
is actually made out of carbon fiber or
graphite<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.300> does<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
graphite so what this does is this

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.880 
graphite so what this does is this
creates<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.820> piece<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.329> graphite<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
creates one piece of graphite from the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
creates one piece of graphite from the
butt<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> rod<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> tip<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> rod

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
butt of the rod to the tip of the rod

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
butt of the rod to the tip of the rod
which<00:00:39.960> truly<00:00:40.739> makes<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.190> rod<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> first

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
which truly makes this rod for the first

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
which truly makes this rod for the first
time<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> rods<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.620> piece

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
time and rods one piece

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
time and rods one piece
this<00:00:45.629> adds<00:00:46.010> maximum<00:00:47.010> sensitivity<00:00:48.469> to<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
this adds maximum sensitivity to this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
this adds maximum sensitivity to this
rod<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.120> times<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
rod because of that a lot of times I

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.819 
rod because of that a lot of times I
don't<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> guys<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.800> not

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
don't know if you guys know it or not

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
don't know if you guys know it or not
but<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> foam<00:00:53.719> or<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> court

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but with the foam or with the court

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
but with the foam or with the court
handle<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> actually<00:00:56.489> lose<00:00:56.730> sensitivity

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
handle you actually lose sensitivity

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.040 
handle you actually lose sensitivity
because<00:00:58.559> court<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.760> deadens<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
because court actually deadens the the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
because court actually deadens the the
feel<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> rod<00:01:01.770> wrapped<00:01:02.250> around<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
feel of the rod wrapped around the the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.980 
feel of the rod wrapped around the the
butt<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> graphite<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> being

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
butt of the graphite here but this being

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
butt of the graphite here but this being
complete<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> complete<00:01:07.920> piece<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> carbon<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
complete a complete piece of carbon it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
complete a complete piece of carbon it
actually<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> lightning<00:01:11.369> rod<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
actually is just like a lightning rod in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.410 
actually is just like a lightning rod in
your<00:01:11.880> hand<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> bite<00:01:14.420> another

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
your hand when you get a bite another

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
your hand when you get a bite another
thing<00:01:15.750> I'd<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> point<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.880> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
thing I'd like to point out is this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.929 
thing I'd like to point out is this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
has a PhD in chemistry and he knows all

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.719 
has a PhD in chemistry and he knows all
the<00:01:24.060> ins<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.420> outs<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:26.280> piece<00:01:26.549> of

the ins and outs about a piece of
graphite<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:28.020> graphite<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.640> he's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
graphite in the make up graphite so he's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.670 
graphite in the make up graphite so he's
able<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> bring<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> rod<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.320> super

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
able to bring a rod to you that's super

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.069

that<00:01:43.049> I'd<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> point<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> look

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that I'd like to point out if you look

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.149 
that I'd like to point out if you look
real<00:01:44.610> close<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.170> micro<00:01:46.860> guides

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
real close here are these micro guides

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.410 
real close here are these micro guides
that<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.570> rod<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:50.210> because<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that are on this rod and because of this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
that are on this rod and because of this
particular<00:01:51.659> setup<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> does<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.310> when

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
particular setup what it does is when

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.389 
particular setup what it does is when
you<00:01:53.640> cast<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.720> streams<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> streamlines

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you cast it streams what the streamlines

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.990 
you cast it streams what the streamlines
the<00:01:56.579> whole<00:01:56.880> effect<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> cast<00:01:59.000> which

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the whole effect of the cast which

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.109 
the whole effect of the cast which
eliminates<00:02:00.719> rod<00:02:01.020> line<00:02:01.950> slat<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.939> times

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
eliminates rod line slat a lot of times
