00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
first of all I just take a straight path

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.450 
first of all I just take a straight path
right<00:00:43.649> along<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
right along and you see what I do is I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.709 
right along and you see what I do is I
try<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> attack<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:52.590> piece<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.370> break

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
try to attack the piece that will break

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.680 
try to attack the piece that will break
easiest<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.620> piece<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.149> easiest

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
easiest the piece that would be easiest

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430 
easiest the piece that would be easiest
for<00:00:57.930> me<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> problem<00:00:59.070> with<00:01:00.109> now<00:01:01.109> on

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
for me to have a problem with now on

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.990 
for me to have a problem with now on
this<00:01:01.649> one

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.850 

see<00:01:08.000> along<00:01:08.270> here<00:01:08.330> see<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.650> nice

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
see along here see this is a nice

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.070 
see along here see this is a nice
straight<00:01:10.340> edge<00:01:10.370> but<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.690> crooked

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
straight edge but this is the crooked

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.460 
straight edge but this is the crooked
edge<00:01:12.230> so<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.070> cut<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.400> crooked<00:01:13.760> edge<00:01:13.940> first

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
edge so we cut the crooked edge first

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.540 
edge so we cut the crooked edge first
now<00:01:15.470> on<00:01:15.650> this<00:01:15.770> one<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.070> gonna<00:01:16.220> come<00:01:16.520> right

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
now on this one I'm gonna come right

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.200 
now on this one I'm gonna come right
straight<00:01:17.300> up<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.470> curve<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:19.700> gonna<00:01:20.000> go

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
straight up to the curve I'm gonna go

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.800 
straight up to the curve I'm gonna go
around<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.840> curves<00:01:25.210> now<00:01:26.210> that's<00:01:26.390> not<00:01:26.630> that

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
around the curves now that's not that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.710 
around the curves now that's not that
big<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.230> deal<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.210> kind<00:01:29.480> of<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
big of a deal this is the kind of a

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.980 
big of a deal this is the kind of a
break<00:01:30.580> that<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.730> would<00:01:31.910> accomplish<00:01:32.510> most<00:01:32.750> of

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
break that you would accomplish most of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.370 
break that you would accomplish most of
the<00:01:33.050> time<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.680> have<00:01:34.280> no<00:01:34.520> problem<00:01:35.090> with<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.380> one

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the time and have no problem with it one

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.110 
the time and have no problem with it one
of<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> reasons<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.250> doesn't<00:01:37.610> break<00:01:37.790> on

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
of the reasons that it doesn't break on

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.109 
of the reasons that it doesn't break on
us<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:38.450> because<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.840> choose<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.830> cut<00:01:40.160> this

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
us is because we choose to cut this

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.230 
us is because we choose to cut this
piece<00:01:41.510> first<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.560> then<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.400> piece<00:01:43.670> second

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
piece first and then this piece second

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.810 
piece first and then this piece second
but<00:01:44.900> now<00:01:45.050> here's<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.619> here's<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.369> technique

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
but now here's the here's the technique

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.700 
but now here's the here's the technique
that<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.119> wanted<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.510> show<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:49.869> we<00:01:50.869> score<00:01:53.710> along

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
that I wanted to show you we score along

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.070 
that I wanted to show you we score along
the<00:01:54.890> glass

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.219 

and<00:01:59.080> then<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.620> do<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.010> hold<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
and then what we do is we hold it and

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.500 
and then what we do is we hold it and
tap<00:02:02.650> all<00:02:02.979> on<00:02:05.760> until<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.880> gives<00:02:07.119> way

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.380 

so<00:02:12.500> these<00:02:13.129> guys<00:02:13.370> who<00:02:13.580> were<00:02:13.610> here<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> shop

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:39.960 
real thin little piece but what we do is
we<00:02:31.280> take<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.640> curve<00:02:31.910> out<00:02:32.209> first

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.369

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.750 

where<00:03:13.159> we<00:03:13.310> hold<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.349> piece<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:16.150> really<00:03:18.760> treat

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
where we hold the piece and really treat

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.640 
where we hold the piece and really treat
it<00:03:19.879> gently<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.230> doesn't<00:03:21.680> set<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
it gently so that it doesn't set so that

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.559 
it gently so that it doesn't set so that
breaks<00:03:24.799> exactly<00:03:25.459> where<00:03:25.640> we<00:03:25.790> want<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.329> just
