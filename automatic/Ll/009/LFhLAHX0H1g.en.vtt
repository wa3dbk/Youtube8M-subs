 Hey youtube people, I 'm not going to do it anymore. 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.230
 a video with the sound playing loud né 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.049
 I'll tell you here about philips staying 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.260
 well the 52 only has 420 watts rms has 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:23.510
 four channels each channel has 5 105 vacancies 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.510
 and mms is two channels only for voice 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.190
 good staff is very good but the bad part 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:46.020
 his is is what is good personal here looks 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 here and 27 because I do not know if 27 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:59.010
 two thousand and nine thousand and I do not know 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 personnel increases the deep voice and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.750
 increases greatly when 27 type 1 cabugá 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.909
 It has just the right car power 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 It's more for the good voice, I hate it. 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.290
 also personal in when the song has a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.970
 sky the 30 hertz so if you force yourself well 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.729
 it went up really hard 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 so you put the music on the basis 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.440
 same bust on the foot let's stay like more 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.920
 serious because it's normal for you 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.360
 that he does not distort in the garage 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.490
 but it was you were the voice of the music she 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.670
 it takes a lot of personal effort a lot 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.860
 very much that is a part of the sound but 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.940
 if you leave the value of 27 ac as 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.920
 I'm not here and that's it. 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.380
 I'm not very good, I have nothing 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.230
 to claim yes on a handle did not 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.990
 no problem there personal with these 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.990
 file boxes 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 thanks
