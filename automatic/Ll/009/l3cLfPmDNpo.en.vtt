this<00:00:49.020> puzzle<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.620> called<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> brain<00:00:50.250> string

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this puzzle is called the brain string

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350 
this puzzle is called the brain string
advanced<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.879> few<00:00:53.879> years<00:00:54.120> back

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
advanced because back a few years back

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.350 
advanced because back a few years back
there<00:00:54.899> used<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> brain<00:00:55.829> screen<00:00:56.360> regular

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there used to be a brain screen regular

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
there used to be a brain screen regular
and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.289> brain<00:00:58.500> strain<00:00:58.739> regular<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and the brain strain regular is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.840 
and the brain strain regular is
basically<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.690> transparent<00:01:01.530> cube<00:01:02.010> pillow

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
basically just a transparent cube pillow

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
basically just a transparent cube pillow
transparent<00:01:03.510> cube<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.799> thing<00:01:05.010> with

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
transparent cube with same thing with

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.570 
transparent cube with same thing with
these<00:01:05.309> elastics<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> puzzle

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
these elastics going through the puzzle

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.929 
these elastics going through the puzzle
but<00:01:08.840> there<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.110> many<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.650> these<00:01:11.040> elastics

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
but there are not many of these elastics

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
but there are not many of these elastics
and<00:01:12.180> their<00:01:13.549> notes<00:01:15.049> bad<00:01:16.049> well<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> won't<00:01:17.130> say<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and their notes bad well I won't say is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.429 
and their notes bad well I won't say is
bad<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:18.900> than<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
bad but this one is better than it's a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
bad but this one is better than it's a
regular<00:01:19.920> version<00:01:20.400> because<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.390> these

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
regular version because you got these

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.590 
regular version because you got these
knobs<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.400> bright<00:01:23.820> color<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
knobs that have their bright color and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.039 
knobs that have their bright color and
these<00:01:25.170> elastics<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.159> also<00:01:26.369> colorful<00:01:27.180> back<00:01:27.720> in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
these elastics are also colorful back in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
these elastics are also colorful back in
the<00:01:28.320> old<00:01:28.500> days<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> had<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.820> brain

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the old days when you had the brain

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
the old days when you had the brain
stream<00:01:30.420> regular<00:01:31.020> these<00:01:31.500> elastics<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.280> all

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
stream regular these elastics are all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
stream regular these elastics are all
black<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.430> fun<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
black and that's not fun and with the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.310 
black and that's not fun and with the
elastics<00:01:38.009> colored<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
elastics colored then this is actually a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
elastics colored then this is actually a
little<00:01:40.530> bit<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.860> easier<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.490> solve<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
little bit more easier to solve and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.389 
little bit more easier to solve and
right<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.930> currently<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.950> solved

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
right now is currently not in solved

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.080 
right now is currently not in solved
position<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:48.000> part<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.380> red

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
position because of this part the red

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.710

intersecting<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> orange<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.970> those

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
intersecting with the orange see those

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.310 
intersecting with the orange see those
two<00:01:55.009> elastics<00:01:56.009> are<00:01:56.159> touching<00:01:56.430> each<00:01:56.700> other<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
two elastics are touching each other and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.359 
two elastics are touching each other and
that<00:01:58.320> shouldn't<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.829> happening

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that shouldn't be happening

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.149 
that shouldn't be happening
the<00:01:59.850> orange<00:02:00.450> should<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> above<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> red<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the orange should be above the red so

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:19.440 
the orange should be above the red so
I'm<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> solve<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.990> now

nice<00:02:33.380> it's<00:02:34.130> very<00:02:34.640> nice<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.690> am<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
nice it's very nice but I am actually a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.890 
nice it's very nice but I am actually a
little<00:02:36.800> bit<00:02:36.920> afraid<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:38.090> mass<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.660> going

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
little bit afraid that the mass is going

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.900 
little bit afraid that the mass is going
to<00:02:39.200> rub<00:02:39.500> over<00:02:39.739> time<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.580> these<00:02:41.480> plastics<00:02:42.910> so

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
to rub over time on these plastics so

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.530 
to rub over time on these plastics so
yeah<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.260> know<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.920> most<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.700> these<00:02:46.880> plastics

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
yeah you know but most of these plastics

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.170 
yeah you know but most of these plastics
are<00:02:47.920> polished<00:02:48.920> but<00:02:49.400> some<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.730> these<00:02:49.819> acute

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
are polished but some of these acute

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.259 
are polished but some of these acute
angles<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.190> one<00:02:52.269> really

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
angles like this one and this one really

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.080 
angles like this one and this one really
worries<00:02:53.690> me<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.890> think<00:02:55.280> we'll<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.430> fine<00:02:55.549> if

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
worries me but I think we'll be fine if

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.530 
worries me but I think we'll be fine if
you<00:02:56.120> maneuver<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.549> tactic<00:03:00.700> okay<00:03:01.700> there

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you maneuver it with tactic okay there

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.690 
you maneuver it with tactic okay there
are<00:03:02.630> four<00:03:02.840> colors<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.380> this<00:03:03.500> puzzle<00:03:03.700> purple

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
are four colors on this puzzle purple

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.009 
are four colors on this puzzle purple
red<00:03:05.000> orange<00:03:05.330> yellow<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:08.540> opposite<00:03:08.930> of

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
red orange yellow and the opposite of

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.410 
red orange yellow and the opposite of
this<00:03:09.290> yellow<00:03:09.560> is<00:03:09.709> also<00:03:10.250> yellow<00:03:10.519> so<00:03:10.970> there's

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
this yellow is also yellow so there's

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.610 
this yellow is also yellow so there's
four<00:03:11.660> colors<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.519> there<00:03:14.209> are<00:03:14.359> two<00:03:14.720> halves<00:03:15.260> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
four colors so there are two halves of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.310 
four colors so there are two halves of
this<00:03:15.950> puzzle<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.970> two<00:03:17.299> three<00:03:17.750> four

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
this puzzle one two three four

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.420 
this puzzle one two three four
oh<00:03:19.420> well<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.870> one<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.380> one<00:03:21.620> half<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.220> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
oh well this one is one half and this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.430 
oh well this one is one half and this
one<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.700> another<00:03:22.880> half<00:03:23.239> separated<00:03:24.230> by<00:03:24.380> this

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
one is another half separated by this

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.690 
one is another half separated by this
very<00:03:24.829> thick<00:03:25.190> line<00:03:27.190> property<00:03:28.190> on<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.489> puzzle

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
very thick line property on this puzzle

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.099 
very thick line property on this puzzle
is<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:31.190> pieces<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:31.970> knobs<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.930> these

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
is that the pieces on knobs and these

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.039 
is that the pieces on knobs and these
half<00:03:33.440> cannot<00:03:34.340> ever<00:03:34.640> swap<00:03:35.150> with<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.420> knobs<00:03:35.780> on

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
half cannot ever swap with the knobs on

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.319 
half cannot ever swap with the knobs on
this<00:03:36.350> half<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:40.400> piece<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.940> never<00:03:41.120> be

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
this half so this piece can never be

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.440 
this half so this piece can never be
swapped<00:03:41.660> with<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:42.139> piece<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:44.090> piece

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
swapped with this piece but this piece

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.129 
swapped with this piece but this piece
can<00:03:44.690> be<00:03:44.750> swapped<00:03:45.139> with<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.739> piece<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:47.139> the

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
can be swapped with this piece so the

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.229 
can be swapped with this piece so the
thick<00:03:48.319> line<00:03:48.650> here<00:03:49.069> sort<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.519> acts<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:50.000> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
thick line here sort of acts like the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.509 
thick line here sort of acts like the
boundary<00:03:51.940> between<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.269> two<00:03:53.420> halves<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.519> like

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
boundary between the two halves and like

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.710 
boundary between the two halves and like
