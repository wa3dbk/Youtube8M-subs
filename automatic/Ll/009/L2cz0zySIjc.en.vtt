so<00:02:36.850> that's<00:02:37.030> pebble<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:38.350> finished<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> design

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
so that's pebble we finished the design

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.949 
so that's pebble we finished the design
and<00:02:39.370> we're<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.120> about<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.480> start<00:02:40.630> production

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
and we're just about to start production

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.740 
and we're just about to start production
but<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:42.040> need<00:02:42.190> help<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.700> get<00:02:42.820> pebble<00:02:43.180> onto<00:02:43.600> your

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
but we need help to get pebble onto your

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.570 
but we need help to get pebble onto your
wrist<00:02:44.070> we<00:02:45.070> hope<00:02:45.220> you'll<00:02:45.370> join<00:02:45.400> us<00:02:45.670> thanks
