very accessible but it also trailing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.860 
very accessible but it also trailing
something<00:01:48.960> deeper<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.720> kind<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
something deeper that is kind of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.730 
something deeper that is kind of
threatening<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> dump<00:01:52.650> in<00:01:53.010> some<00:01:53.040> degree<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
threatening to dump in some degree so I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.960 
threatening to dump in some degree so I
was<00:01:56.220> trying<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.790> different

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
ideas for the cat whether I want to look

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
ideas for the cat whether I want to look
like<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> Hallmark<00:01:59.520> card<00:01:59.790> are<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.540> too<00:02:01.020> hard

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.060 
like a Hallmark card are really too hard
graphic<00:02:02.550> design<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:03.440> came<00:02:04.440> up<00:02:04.590> something<00:02:04.950> in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
graphic design and came up something in

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.359 
graphic design and came up something in
between<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.790> did<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.960> sketches<00:02:07.369> then

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
between I did a lot of sketches then

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
between I did a lot of sketches then
trade<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.179> own<00:02:09.300> statute<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> clean<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.260> up

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
trade to my own statute to clean it up

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.730 
trade to my own statute to clean it up
and<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.840> came<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:13.170> with<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.350> really<00:02:13.380> good

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and I think I came up with a really good
