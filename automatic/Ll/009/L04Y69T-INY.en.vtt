very very straightforward also you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.100 
very very straightforward also you
probably<00:03:16.400> noticed<00:03:17.180> earlier<00:03:17.480> when<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> drove<00:03:18.050> up

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
probably noticed earlier when I drove up

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.530 
probably noticed earlier when I drove up
that<00:03:18.560> it's<00:03:18.709> very<00:03:18.950> maneuverable<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.060> has<00:03:20.510> a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
that it's very maneuverable it has a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.470 
that it's very maneuverable it has a
single<00:03:21.230> rear<00:03:21.800> wheel<00:03:22.070> steering<00:03:22.490> system<00:03:23.060> that

single rear wheel steering system that
actually<00:03:23.630> gives<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.080> true<00:03:24.260> zero<00:03:24.500> turning

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
actually gives a true zero turning

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.010 
actually gives a true zero turning
radius<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:26.150> although<00:03:26.360> it's<00:03:26.600> designed<00:03:26.930> for

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
radius so although it's designed for

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.440 
radius so although it's designed for
open<00:03:27.440> areas<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.220> highly<00:03:28.700> maneuverable<00:03:29.270> and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
open areas it's highly maneuverable and

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.020 
open areas it's highly maneuverable and

something else I'd like to show you we
talked<00:04:59.150> about<00:04:59.300> earlier<00:04:59.420> that<00:04:59.810> this<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.050> a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
talked about earlier that this is a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.680 
talked about earlier that this is a
machine<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.830> can<00:05:00.970> greatly<00:05:01.970> take<00:05:02.360> care<00:05:02.600> of
