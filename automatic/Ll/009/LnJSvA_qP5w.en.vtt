 how development is taking place and the 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.789
 plants a temperature video card 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.760
 Dilma in the sema 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.180
 performed in two shifts is having a vigorous growth 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 to sound the revelry is expanding every day 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.100

 what's that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.730
 the oni will be driven from the plant 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.220
 for production 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.430
 the carnival 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.540

 an 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.070

 our plants 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.570
 they are showing cotinue denise 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.280
 which means that the plant did not have any type of star during its 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 vegetative development is right. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.040
 and I stay 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.660
 piti is not a widely used technical argument and one of the advantages 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.580
 daniel mendez said he has it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.380
