endless runner with a little bit of a
twist<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.690> how<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.839> works<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:17.029> if<00:00:18.029> you've<00:00:18.150> ever

played ikaruga now Ikaruga was a game it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.650 
played ikaruga now Ikaruga was a game it

was a shoot-'em-up or shmoop as they as
they<00:00:24.869> often<00:00:25.170> say<00:00:26.510> where<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.260> could<00:00:28.500> absorb

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
they often say where you could absorb

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
they often say where you could absorb
the<00:00:29.340> energy<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:30.090> incoming<00:00:30.689> bullets<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the energy of incoming bullets if you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
the energy of incoming bullets if you
were<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> same<00:00:31.769> color<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.250> those<00:00:32.399> bullets

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
were the same color as those bullets

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.530 
were the same color as those bullets
otherwise<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.989> took<00:00:34.380> damage<00:00:34.880> but<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.149> worked

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
otherwise you took damage but it worked

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.819 
otherwise you took damage but it worked
with<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> enemies<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> same<00:00:37.320> way<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:39.110> if<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
with the enemies the same way so if you

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
with the enemies the same way so if you
were<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> shoot<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.270> enemy<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:43.079> opposite

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
color it would actually damage them if

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.950 
color it would actually damage them if
you<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> same<00:00:45.600> color<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you should some of the same color it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.029

can<00:02:27.959> tell<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.470> cool<00:02:28.799> audio<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.299> music<00:02:30.600> is

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
can tell really cool audio the music is

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.590 
can tell really cool audio the music is
is<00:02:30.989> quite<00:02:32.120> sci-fi<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.900> reminiscent<00:02:34.560> of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
is quite sci-fi very reminiscent of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:44.420 
is quite sci-fi very reminiscent of
canabalt<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> now<00:02:43.079> as<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.410> go<00:02:43.530> along<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:44.130> does

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
canabalt so now as we go along it does

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.460 
canabalt so now as we go along it does
get<00:02:44.609> a<00:02:44.790> lot<00:02:45.359> more<00:02:45.420> difficult<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
get a lot more difficult and the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.240 
get a lot more difficult and the
patterns<00:02:46.950> become<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.280> lot<00:02:47.489> more<00:02:47.519> complex<00:02:49.250> well

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
patterns become a lot more complex well

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.310 
patterns become a lot more complex well
that<00:02:50.609> was<00:02:50.760> just<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.030> silly<00:02:51.239> mistake<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:55.290> I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
that was just a silly mistake but I

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720 
that was just a silly mistake but I
really<00:02:55.709> enjoy<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.980> art<00:02:56.100> style<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.609> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
really enjoy the art style I think it's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.729 
really enjoy the art style I think it's
very<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:59.420> nice<00:03:00.420> very<00:03:00.600> Tron<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:02.160> dig<00:03:02.430> that

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
very very nice very Tron and I dig that

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.380 
very very nice very Tron and I dig that
it<00:03:04.739> plays<00:03:04.980> very<00:03:05.160> well<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.549> very<00:03:05.700> easy<00:03:05.880> just

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
it plays very well it's very easy just

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.170 
it plays very well it's very easy just
took<00:03:07.350> two<00:03:07.560> buttons<00:03:07.890> pretty<00:03:08.130> much<00:03:08.280> left<00:03:08.910> side

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
took two buttons pretty much left side

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.660 
took two buttons pretty much left side
of<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> screen<00:03:09.650> as<00:03:10.650> i<00:03:10.829> said<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.100> change<00:03:11.310> colors

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
of the screen as i said to change colors

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.020 
of the screen as i said to change colors
and<00:03:11.970> right<00:03:12.239> side<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.780> jump

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.520 

and<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.239> replay<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.629> levels<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:20.140> many

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and you can replay the levels as many

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.619 
and you can replay the levels as many
times<00:03:20.709> as<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:20.950> want<00:03:21.129> there<00:03:21.819> are<00:03:21.969> special

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
times as you want there are special

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:23.880 
times as you want there are special
items<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.019> collect<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.469> those<00:03:23.560> let<00:03:23.769> you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
items to collect and those let you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.619 
items to collect and those let you
unlock<00:03:24.269> other<00:03:25.269> levels<00:03:25.810> other<00:03:26.109> game<00:03:26.739> modes<00:03:27.629> so

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
unlock other levels other game modes so

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.349 
unlock other levels other game modes so
what<00:03:28.719> we<00:03:28.810> continue<00:03:29.140> on<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.319> level<00:03:29.439> two<00:03:33.359> now

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
what we continue on to level two now

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.690 
what we continue on to level two now
this<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.470> an<00:03:35.590> interesting<00:03:35.650> mechanic<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.579> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
this is an interesting mechanic so the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.479 
this is an interesting mechanic so the
the<00:03:37.329> rails<00:03:37.599> actually<00:03:38.170> only<00:03:38.709> work<00:03:39.129> when<00:03:39.370> you're

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the rails actually only work when you're

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.970 
the rails actually only work when you're
the<00:03:39.700> same<00:03:39.909> color<00:03:40.239> as<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.409> to<00:03:41.470> speed<00:03:41.799> up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
the same color as them so to speed up

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.069 
the same color as them so to speed up
well<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:43.120> you'd<00:03:43.269> be<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.359> little<00:03:43.629> bit<00:03:43.750> faster

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
well and you'd be a little bit faster

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.569 
well and you'd be a little bit faster
than<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.530> speed<00:03:44.739> up<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:44.950> need<00:03:45.129> to<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.370> blue

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
than that to speed up I need to be blue

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.349 
than that to speed up I need to be blue
to<00:03:45.909> activate<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.569> speed<00:03:47.290> boost<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.099> then<00:03:49.090> as

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
to activate the speed boost and then as

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.509 
to activate the speed boost and then as
you<00:03:49.569> can<00:03:49.689> see<00:03:49.870> because<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.319> was<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.829> same<00:03:51.280> color

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
you can see because I was the same color

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.379 
you can see because I was the same color
I<00:03:52.510> was<00:03:53.170> unable<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.790> progress<00:03:54.790> further<00:03:55.090> because

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
I was unable to progress further because

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.690 
I was unable to progress further because
I<00:03:55.540> needed<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.989> be<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:57.730> faster<00:03:59.099> so<00:04:00.099> as<00:04:00.430> we<00:04:00.579> can

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
I needed to be going faster so as we can

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.970 
I needed to be going faster so as we can
as<00:04:00.939> you<00:04:01.090> can<00:04:01.180> see<00:04:01.269> here<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.510> need<00:04:01.689> to<00:04:01.840> be<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
as you can see here I need to be the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.839 
as you can see here I need to be the
same<00:04:06.189> color<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.810> increase<00:04:07.810> speed<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:09.760> the

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
same color to increase speed and all the

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.580 
same color to increase speed and all the
while<00:04:10.000> paying<00:04:10.299> attention<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.930> what's<00:04:11.379> coming

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
while paying attention to what's coming

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.529 
while paying attention to what's coming
in<00:04:11.950> front<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.819> you<00:04:14.909> so<00:04:15.909> does<00:04:16.090> get<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> little<00:04:16.359> bit

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
in front of you so does get a little bit

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.800 
in front of you so does get a little bit
confusing<00:04:16.959> but<00:04:17.199> that's<00:04:17.380> um<00:04:17.650> that's<00:04:18.660> all<00:04:19.660> part

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
confusing but that's um that's all part

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.960 
confusing but that's um that's all part
of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.079> fun<00:04:20.259> it's<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.889> lot<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.699> pattern

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
of the fun it's a lot of pattern

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.270 
of the fun it's a lot of pattern
recognition<00:04:22.229> but<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.289> dig<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:25.380> that's<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:26.770> a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
recognition but I dig that that's like a

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.620 
recognition but I dig that that's like a
lot<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.909> the<00:04:27.970> best<00:04:28.180> Ikaruga<00:04:28.750> players<00:04:28.990> were

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
lot of the best Ikaruga players were

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.589 
lot of the best Ikaruga players were
more<00:04:31.630> memory<00:04:32.020> than<00:04:32.080> anything<00:04:32.710> else<00:04:32.860> they<00:04:33.159> just

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
more memory than anything else they just

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.730 
more memory than anything else they just
could<00:04:34.599> work<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:36.090> how<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.150> how<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.169> system's

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
could work on how the how the system's

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.480 
could work on how the how the system's
play<00:04:39.599> oops

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.150 

so<00:04:48.479> as<00:04:48.599> you<00:04:48.720> can<00:04:48.810> see<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.470> does<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.830> quite

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
so as you can see it does get quite

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.409 
so as you can see it does get quite
intense<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.030> goes<00:04:51.180> very<00:04:51.389> fast<00:04:54.110> now<00:04:56.419> when

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
intense and it goes very fast now when

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.870 
intense and it goes very fast now when
we<00:04:57.509> head<00:04:57.630> back<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.990> main<00:04:58.139> menu<00:04:58.789> so<00:04:59.789> it's

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
we head back to the main menu so it's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.040 
we head back to the main menu so it's
just<00:04:59.940> telling<00:05:00.210> me<00:05:00.270> how<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.419> went<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.840> level

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
just telling me how I went that level

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.469 
just telling me how I went that level
eight<00:05:01.169> deaths<00:05:01.470> it's<00:05:01.770> not<00:05:02.699> bad<00:05:02.880> if<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.150> ask<00:05:03.180> me

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
eight deaths it's not bad if you ask me

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.890 
eight deaths it's not bad if you ask me
um<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:06.000> head<00:05:06.120> back<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.419> main<00:05:06.539> menu<00:05:06.569> we<00:05:06.870> can

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
um we head back to the main menu we can

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.150 
um we head back to the main menu we can
actually<00:05:07.229> check<00:05:07.349> out<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.740> different<00:05:08.009> game

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
actually check out the different game

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
they're often placed in unusual places

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.129 
they're often placed in unusual places

the<00:05:28.289> level<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:28.740> you<00:05:28.770> need<00:05:29.009> to<00:05:29.099> be<00:05:30.560> on<00:05:31.560> the

meters in random normal collect ten

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.390 
meters in random normal collect ten
polara<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:39.240> polara<00:05:39.630> is<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> full<00:05:40.380> sequence<00:05:41.220> of

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.120 
letters red and blue and as you can see
as<00:05:45.150> you<00:05:45.270> go<00:05:45.389> on<00:05:45.419> there's<00:05:45.990> more<00:05:46.139> modes<00:05:46.919> to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
as you go on there's more modes to

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.149 
as you go on there's more modes to
unlock<00:05:47.599> so<00:05:48.599> let's<00:05:48.780> try<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.080> random<00:05:49.620> normal

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
unlock so let's try the random normal

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.719 
unlock so let's try the random normal
mode<00:05:52.039> give<00:05:53.039> that<00:05:53.190> a<00:05:53.219> go<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:56.250> now<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.430> thing

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
mode give that a go so now the thing

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.550 
mode give that a go so now the thing
with<00:05:56.849> random<00:05:57.180> mode<00:05:57.330> is<00:05:57.479> obviously<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.229> can't

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
with random mode is obviously you can't

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.480 
with random mode is obviously you can't
memorize<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.520> because<00:06:00.860> well<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:02.250> don't

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
memorize it because well you don't

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.890 
memorize it because well you don't
actually<00:06:02.699> know<00:06:02.909> what's<00:06:03.060> going<00:06:03.300> on<00:06:03.389> so<00:06:05.780> as<00:06:06.780> you
