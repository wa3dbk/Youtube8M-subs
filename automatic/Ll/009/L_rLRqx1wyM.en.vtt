00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hi , what are you doing? 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.870
 inspired by the shan 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.300
 but the great thing that this makeup 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
 brown smudge is that I used it only 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.400
 a shadow believes that this young man now 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.379
 on to everything that's doing on stage 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.359
 in the video and give a gem because it looks me 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 I do not know what to do. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.560
 accompanies who accompanies the taste channel 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 practical thing likes fast thing 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.410
 so I left the most practical thing 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.029
 It's still okay to use collective too but 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.340
 do not take everyone away from you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.890
 collective right mode is possible with the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.899
 corrective advance to everybody tries half 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.460
 every year brings light but it may be that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.620
 he would erase the one his 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 that deal with the pec does not matter 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 I also used a beige pencil black pencil 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 because it is there that it should and goes below 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.750
 eyebrow is a tutorial part of the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 eyebrow lower right're're in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.789
 make up 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 I also used the black pencil in the line 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.039
 common water goes people are part of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 also only one shade 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.910
 hamas bruna got several browns in 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.930
 Your book called I know you. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.730
 can 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.320
 There is the trick that puts a little pressure 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 to get darker takes the pressure 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.229
 which is lighter and other clips that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.780
 I'm going to show material 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.670
 The following comes with me, which is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 is fast is so love while 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.780
 You need a palette to talk to your 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 colleague when you need a palette 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:39.630
 I whole with a name shadow well 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:41.369
 as the law then we go there 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.530
 tutorial will debut on Thursday 10th when 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 razor-sharp makeup as well as all 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.630
 brothers of her people that was wonderful, huh? 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.759
 very inspiring did not start a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.579
 concealment over the entire movable eyelid that 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.380
 how deep the brush to whom because the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.350
 collective will consider as a basis for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.180
 Shady and cool here where the brown shadow 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.780
 meet with corrective she will stay 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.579
 together 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.290
 where she was not, she stays from another 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.540
 so here we already have a trick to 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.599
 get two kuru effects publish 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.430
 in the inner corner already 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.380
 and below the eyebrow already 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.510
 has 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980
 beige pencil this beige pencil is that I 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 Can I have an eyebrow? 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.500
 link 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.420
 the actor for you to check step 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.550
 eyebrow step running here 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020
 equipment and in the ways 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.510
 Like I said, now it gets dusty. 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.290
 translucent can be a normal parent of yours. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 pop skin solution and I 'll just apply 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.630
 in the inner corner and only in control 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.620
 because I'm going to leave paulo branco 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.330
 collective to stay with this thing more 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.980
 crematory of the collective that has already 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.650
 taxpayer will receive a faded I 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.670
 step dust that will leave the so - called more 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.070
 Of course it will also pass the way here 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.600
 now I come with the brown shadow and I go 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.610
 it vanishes first in the outer corner 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.120
 where has a right powder corrector marlon 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.790
 also dark the color of coffee because 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.770
 the corrective power does not 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.990
 put a lot of shade in the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.120
 external field where it gets darker 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.830
 Then I'll just take the rest of the game. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.850
 Leftover from the brush I do not get more 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.160
 brown shadow 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.450
 only it is there already so a clothes goes 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.700
 be clearer that you have less 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.370
 amount or apply a lighter weight 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.380
 I'll also get a thinner brush than 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.510
 will give more precision will put more 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.170
 products and I will apply close to the eyelashes 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.370
 focus on the region to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.780
 leave a brown as if it were a 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.880
 outlined very strong 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.340
 I'll take more in the outer corner and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 to put a lot of shade in this moment 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.110
 to deposit that you shade to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360
 cling to the eyelid of that darker shade 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.340
 that's why this region is also a frog 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.000
 got stronger 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.110
 only in this region in the canton of hazel 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.370
 dark and you can see that it already has two tones 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.080
 brown in there 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.910
 back to the son brush picks up only one 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.580
 little brown shadow and now I'm going 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 very light with lightness to the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.610
 maximum that sea above the eye line 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.330
 noun account in the contest a bit 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.370
 above it I thoroughly with the brush to 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.750
 create a certain depth with this 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.180
 depth at start up is more 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.340
 As I went upstairs I shot the 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.410
 brush pressure and brown gets 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.970
 increasingly clear that he finds himself 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.970
 with beige pencil and becomes lighter 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.180
 automatically or pick up a black pencil 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.979
 in his black pearl beige pencil is another 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.270
 side I used below Brasilia I 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.979
 I will 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 13 on the entire water line and 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.449
 going down slightly to the eyelashes 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.349
 underneath by giving a light bar 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.330
 also locate between the eyelashes 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.770
 and I already have eyelashes 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.810
 is the lux the net go of the new 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.509
 York put it to you here 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.979
 the description of it and I will apply 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.069
 upper lashes back to the shade 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.770
 brown and for that firm little brush 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.330
 and I will fade all over itself black pencils 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.190
 It's not supposed to be marked for us to stay. 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.389
 formed so I'm somewhat above 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.650
 as below 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.090
 spread this side well it is obvious that where 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.770
 There is a black pencil, but it will not stay. 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.169
 most chosen have one where it is 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.780
 the top of the black became almost black brown 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.090
 in the hand of crass the very dark brown of the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.849
 outer corner was deposited with 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.610
 enough force and depositing the product 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.069
 brown that meets both with 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.150
 beige pencil as with the correction is 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.340
 clarinet brown 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.620
 ok eyelash mask on top and bottom 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.409
 this mark is the same footprint l'orÃ©al no 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.870
 there is Brazil still out there but the 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.750
 People really enjoyed walking, it's ready. 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.250
 super fast super practical makeup 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.419
 because it's a color just not 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.770
 is a house you can use in 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.630
 any occasion that has an eye 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.090
 on the street signs and there is not much 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.430
 people on the false eyelashes of course 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.199
 optional and can only be finished with a 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.479
 That's great, too, when you have the 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.669

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.039
