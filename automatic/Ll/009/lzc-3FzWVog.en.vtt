00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.639
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 on the field of neuro-anatomy and 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.450
 Although we have been with us lately 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 the construction of our brain busy 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 with the different ones in here today 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.710
 and floors and today we occupy 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.660
 us with the operating system or the view 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.920
 I would like to start with what 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.239
 at all is present 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.250
 nico is a clear and colorless 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.399
 body fluid and that gives to the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 both the brain and ours 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.149
 spinal cord lies where contains actually 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 only lymphocytes and becomes 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.300
 differentiated epithelial cells of the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.699
 plexus corridor formed the black 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.600
 crowes coro ideos is a branched one 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 braid and although this is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 braid in every corner of ours 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 brain and peculiarity of the plexus 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 corridors is that in the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 lateral openings of the quarter 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.909
 vantrix will come later 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.560
 on how these pages are called openings 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.979
 I like this practice in part 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 and that has both clinical significance 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 and here this plexus is also throbbing 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.740
 called electric BlumenkÃ¶rbchen 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 if you've heard that term before 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 the human has in his brain and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.729
 also in the spinal cord about 120 to 200 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.610
 milliliter league 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 worth up to 700 a day 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.990
 milliliter new produced that includes 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.820
 even if we constantly only 120 to 200 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.420
 milliliter league was in us that have 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.070
 this both summed up and new 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.829
 must be produced 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.500
 new production has already been said 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.630
 he from the plexus corp videos and now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690
 Let's take a look at the individual 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.819
 Steps and systems of production 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.810
 to the reception and of course then 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.190
 again 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 We deal with the breakdown of the micro 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.680
 begin with the inner league for 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.950
 system and there I have you here now 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.440
 ever brought a picture you see 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.870
 here the brain first temporal lobe 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.220
 Every little one does not like us that way 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 very busy 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.190
 we are looking at this ventricle here 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.010
 system 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:46.470
 our internal ventricular system consists 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.680
 two pages develop in each 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.920
 Cerebrum half one which one designates 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.040
 as lateral or first and second 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.410
 it does not matter if you are now ventricle 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.709
 the left half of the brain the first 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.519
 ventricle called or the right 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.610
 corner 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.290
 The first thing that develops is that the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.739
 pages develop the first and the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.120
 second band rickel represent the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.829
 we have drinking ventricles here 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.459
 which is located in the so-called 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.760
 Decay and have the fourth ventricle 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.720
 We are down here in the winter 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.910
 if the whole then from the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.190
 brain time extracting only the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.579
 sales system looks then recognizes 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 So this structure here again 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:43.260
 to repeat two sided ventricles 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.989
 here is only one shown then the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.959
 third ventricle of the second sets her 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:55.970
 then the second page developed and 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:59.220
 develop a quarter if there is one 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.940
 There is an internal liquor system then there is 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.459
 also an external microsystem i have 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.350
 here once again made a survey 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.269
 if you have it for free now 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.319
 we will look at the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:15.000
 survey 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.870
 we have two lateral ventricles in 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.989
 both brain halves these two 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.750
 lateral ventricles are with the third 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.100
 connected via the ventricle 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.680
 so-called 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:35.070
 if tricolore then we have one 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.070
 fourth and third 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.470
 ventricle and the fourth ventricle 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.410
 over the aqueduct it in ziffer liam 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.810
 neon cephalon 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.310
 it is called the third ventricle located 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.520
 to disintegrate in a team 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.740
 the architect, are located me 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:00.390
 very lost and the fourth ventricle 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:03.840
 in the robin cephalon course this is 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.340
 system here in the brain and I have too 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.910
 said we also have in ours 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.390
 spinal cord a song the system and 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.120
 risk central and canales stands 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.950
 of course with our brain 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.950
 ventricle system in connection 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.340
 as I said in his inner league where 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.170
 There is also an external system 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.820
 delivery system 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.030
 And of course that is synonymous with the 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.860
 inner league ko system in connection 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.860
 and that is in the subarachnoid hemorrhage 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.340
 it is about three equipment and indeed 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:45.990
 a medial location and two 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.180
 I have laterally lying devices 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.880
 just told with the board 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.000
 electric flower baskets and that 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.940
 it's just like the places scorpius 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.340
 in this equipment out here 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.070
 chosen and therefore needs here 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.280
 called electric flower skullcap 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.280
 becomes 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.650
 if we do it all over again 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:15.990
 want to clarify here on the picture 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:18.659
 we are here with our first 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.180
 pages if daily here directly under 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:26.520
 Bars over head and on corpus 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.199
 callosum then here we have the third 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.090
 band usually included 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.860
 you also see the arrow of this the 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.270
 liquor direction again league where 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:41.849
 is trained and here we find the 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:44.580
 fourth title led ventricle we have 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:47.819
 said to have connection to the outer league 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.509
 Anteroom over three equipment and the are 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.509
 shown here 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.110
 that looks partly still the 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:07:01.590
 plexus corridors we from the apparatuses 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:06.569
 blown out now so we have the 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:09.930
 away from the inner to the outer league where 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:12.710
 room was the outer league was 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.180
 room is here 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:21.210
 outside the brain is called outside 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:23.729
 but out of the brain right now 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.870
 Let's take a closer look 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:31.650
 look like the outer league where space 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:35.550
 is formed as already said 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:40.110
 the outer league anteroom in the 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:43.830
 so-called subarachnoid hemorrhage 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.740
 the meninges explain the portal space 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:50.130
 lies between the godfather of the brain and 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:55.469
 the archea on the side of the hard 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:56.370
 meninges and if we are exactly 

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:58.319
 look at 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.880
 At the same time we just stay here 

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:07.110
 this page then has this one 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.810
 subarachnoidal hemorrhage which is considered as 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:13.460
 called cisterns in the 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.460
 the liquid circulates
