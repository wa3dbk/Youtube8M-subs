get<00:01:21.330> banglar<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.470> don't

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
get banglar with them so just don't

worry<00:01:22.830> about<00:01:22.950> those<00:01:23.310> ones<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
worry about those ones just go with the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.320 
worry about those ones just go with the
average<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> large<00:01:25.409> size<00:01:25.710> enemies<00:01:26.330> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.789 
average to the large size enemies the
small<00:01:27.570> ones<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.110> tend<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.530> right

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
small ones will just tend to go right

so<00:01:31.150> they're<00:01:32.150> not<00:01:32.240> worth<00:01:32.450> picking<00:01:32.690> up<00:01:34.570> it's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
so they're not worth picking up it's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.760 
so they're not worth picking up it's
hard<00:01:35.780> enough<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.080> grab<00:01:36.290> them<00:01:36.500> with<00:01:36.650> this

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
hard enough to grab them with this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.440 
hard enough to grab them with this
character<00:01:36.979> anyway<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.850> wouldn't<00:01:38.240> waste<00:01:38.330> my

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
character anyway so I wouldn't waste my

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.320 
character anyway so I wouldn't waste my
time<00:01:38.540> with<00:01:38.930> them<00:01:39.490> despite<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:40.610> very<00:01:40.940> easy

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
time with them despite it's very easy

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.540 
time with them despite it's very easy
it's<00:01:41.780> probably<00:01:42.590> one<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> easiest<00:01:42.920> fights

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
it's probably one of the easiest fights

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.600 
it's probably one of the easiest fights
in<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.759> game<00:01:44.560> especially<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.190> know<00:01:46.310> once<00:01:46.520> you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
in the game especially you know once you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.999 
in the game especially you know once you
memorize<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.150> enemy<00:01:47.450> pattern<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.619> makes<00:01:48.890> it

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
memorize the enemy pattern it makes it

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.310 
memorize the enemy pattern it makes it
even<00:01:49.130> easier<00:01:49.340> which<00:01:50.210> doesn't<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.050> doesn't

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
even easier which doesn't it doesn't

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.160 
even easier which doesn't it doesn't
change<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.920> hard<00:01:52.310> version<00:01:52.659> both<00:01:53.659> fights

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
change in the hard version both fights

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
change in the hard version both fights
have<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.560> same<00:01:54.800> exact<00:01:55.220> pattern<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.670> they'll

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
have the same exact pattern and they'll

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.960

just<00:04:51.490> replace<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> really<00:04:52.390> bad<00:04:52.630> government

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
just replace a really bad government

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.550 
just replace a really bad government
with<00:04:54.100> an<00:04:54.220> even<00:04:54.520> worse<00:04:54.760> government<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.560> don't

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
with an even worse government I don't

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.780 
with an even worse government I don't
really<00:04:56.680> know<00:04:56.890> but<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:57.280> doesn't<00:04:57.340> seem<00:04:57.730> like

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
really know but it doesn't seem like

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.660 
really know but it doesn't seem like
it's<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.210> good<00:04:58.390> ending<00:04:58.690> I<00:04:59.250> don't<00:05:00.250> know<00:05:00.340> but<00:05:00.520> it's

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
it's a good ending I don't know but it's

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.670 
it's a good ending I don't know but it's
a<00:05:01.090> disappointing<00:05:01.780> ending<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.140> guess<00:05:02.380> because

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
a disappointing ending I guess because

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.980 
a disappointing ending I guess because
that's<00:05:02.890> all<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.190> happens<00:05:03.580> there<00:05:03.900> even<00:05:04.900> on

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
that's all that happens there even on

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.480 
that's all that happens there even on
hard<00:05:05.230> mode<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.440> thought<00:05:05.710> they'd<00:05:05.890> reward<00:05:06.310> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
hard mode I thought they'd reward you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.460 
hard mode I thought they'd reward you
with<00:05:06.640> something<00:05:07.000> better<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:07.930> they<00:05:08.290> don't

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
with something better and they don't

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.880 
with something better and they don't
which<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.220> too<00:05:09.400> bad<00:05:10.200> but<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.290> game<00:05:11.440> itself<00:05:11.590> as

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
which is too bad but the game itself as

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.910 
which is too bad but the game itself as
a<00:05:11.950> whole<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.280> fun<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.790> know<00:05:13.440> it's<00:05:14.440> worth

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
a whole is fun you know it's worth

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.770 
a whole is fun you know it's worth
playing<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.400> even<00:05:15.640> I<00:05:15.700> mean<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.540> don't<00:05:16.720> really

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
playing it even I mean you don't really

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.100 
playing it even I mean you don't really
need<00:05:17.170> to<00:05:17.770> deeper<00:05:18.130> foot<00:05:18.280> story<00:05:18.550> for<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:19.110> beat

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
need to deeper foot story for a beat

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.140 
need to deeper foot story for a beat
them<00:05:20.260> up<00:05:20.410> so<00:05:20.770> i<00:05:20.800> guess<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.640> know<00:05:21.730> it's<00:05:21.880> ok

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
them up so i guess that you know it's ok

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.200 
them up so i guess that you know it's ok
that<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.360> ending<00:05:22.750> kind<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.080> blows<00:05:23.380> but<00:05:24.210> the

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
that the ending kind of blows but the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.150 
that the ending kind of blows but the
game<00:05:25.390> is<00:05:25.510> fun<00:05:25.690> my<00:05:25.900> only<00:05:26.050> real<00:05:26.410> gripe<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.950> guess

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
game is fun my only real gripe I guess

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.080 
game is fun my only real gripe I guess
if<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.430> had<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.610> have<00:05:27.850> one<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.360> a<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:30.670> length<00:05:30.910> of

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
if I had to have one is a the length of

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.750 
if I had to have one is a the length of
the<00:05:31.210> stages<00:05:31.480> makes<00:05:31.840> no<00:05:32.080> sense<00:05:32.520> when<00:05:33.520> you're<00:05:33.610> on

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
the stages makes no sense when you're on

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.170 
the stages makes no sense when you're on
stage<00:05:33.880> six<00:05:34.450> it<00:05:34.720> shouldn't<00:05:35.140> be<00:05:35.880> like<00:05:36.880> three

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
stage six it shouldn't be like three

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.030 
stage six it shouldn't be like three
times<00:05:37.420> shorter<00:05:37.750> than<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.110> first<00:05:38.350> stage<00:05:38.680> I

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
times shorter than the first stage I

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.670 
times shorter than the first stage I
mean<00:05:40.030> what<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.360> stage<00:05:40.810> six<00:05:41.080> was<00:05:41.260> like<00:05:41.410> one

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
mean what the stage six was like one

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.370 
mean what the stage six was like one
hallway<00:05:41.920> and<00:05:42.810> that<00:05:43.810> that<00:05:44.080> was<00:05:44.200> really

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
hallway and that that was really

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.870 
hallway and that that was really
disappointing<00:05:45.010> especially<00:05:45.250> when<00:05:45.700> they<00:05:45.760> had

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
disappointing especially when they had

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.100 
disappointing especially when they had
the<00:05:46.030> probably<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.390> best<00:05:46.600> music<00:05:46.810> in<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.020> game

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
the probably the best music in the game

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.940 
the probably the best music in the game
in<00:05:47.380> it<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:49.290> that's<00:05:50.290> my<00:05:50.410> only<00:05:50.560> complaint

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
in it so that's my only complaint

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.080 
in it so that's my only complaint
everything<00:05:51.280> else<00:05:51.430> it's<00:05:51.580> a<00:05:51.640> pretty<00:05:51.850> damn<00:05:52.030> good

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
everything else it's a pretty damn good

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.960 
everything else it's a pretty damn good
game<00:05:52.300> I<00:05:53.010> guess<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.160> does<00:05:54.310> lack<00:05:54.550> some<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:54.910> the

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
game I guess it does lack some of the

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.220 
game I guess it does lack some of the
depth<00:05:55.180> other<00:05:55.480> fighting<00:05:55.750> games<00:05:55.870> have

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
depth other fighting games have

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.740 
depth other fighting games have
especially<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.950> mean<00:05:57.190> there's<00:05:57.310> no<00:05:57.600> depth<00:05:58.600> of

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
especially I mean there's no depth of

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.690 
especially I mean there's no depth of
field<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.200> can't<00:05:59.410> go<00:05:59.560> up<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.890> down<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.370> just

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
field you can't go up and down you just

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.050 
field you can't go up and down you just
stuck<00:06:00.970> on<00:06:01.120> one<00:06:01.330> linear<00:06:01.720> path<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.320> whole<00:06:02.470> way

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
stuck on one linear path the whole way

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.150 
stuck on one linear path the whole way
but<00:06:04.060> still<00:06:04.330> thanks<00:06:04.840> a<00:06:04.870> lot<00:06:04.930> tight<00:06:05.290> oh<00:06:05.320> god<00:06:05.980> this

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
but still thanks a lot tight oh god this

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.190 
but still thanks a lot tight oh god this
game<00:06:06.340> was<00:06:06.520> pretty<00:06:06.730> good<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.660> I<00:06:09.840> will<00:06:10.840> probably

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
game was pretty good and I will probably

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.870 
game was pretty good and I will probably
play<00:06:11.320> this<00:06:11.530> one<00:06:11.740> again<00:06:11.860> even<00:06:12.430> though<00:06:12.550> I<00:06:12.580> just

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
play this one again even though I just

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.770 
play this one again even though I just
finished<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.600> don't<00:06:14.440> know

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
finished it I don't know

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.870 
finished it I don't know
like<00:06:16.290> un<00:06:16.620> squadron<00:06:16.860> I<00:06:17.160> probably<00:06:17.490> won't<00:06:17.670> pick

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
like un squadron I probably won't pick

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.129 
like un squadron I probably won't pick
that<00:06:18.060> game<00:06:18.210> up<00:06:18.330> again<00:06:18.570> for<00:06:18.720> quite<00:06:18.960> some<00:06:19.170> time

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
that game up again for quite some time

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.540 
that game up again for quite some time
this<00:06:22.139> game<00:06:22.380> is<00:06:22.560> definitely<00:06:22.980> fun<00:06:23.160> that's<00:06:23.430> not

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
this game is definitely fun that's not

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.159 
this game is definitely fun that's not
really<00:06:23.880> I<00:06:23.940> mean<00:06:23.970> there's<00:06:24.240> no<00:06:24.360> real<00:06:24.570> replay

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
really I mean there's no real replay

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.040 
really I mean there's no real replay
value<00:06:25.730> but<00:06:27.230> yeah<00:06:28.910> so<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.150> sadly<00:06:30.540> this<00:06:30.660> game<00:06:30.900> is

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
value but yeah so the sadly this game is

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.670 
value but yeah so the sadly this game is
over<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.560> I<00:06:32.780> guess<00:06:33.780> I<00:06:33.900> can<00:06:34.050> move<00:06:34.260> on<00:06:34.440> to<00:06:34.560> my

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
over and I guess I can move on to my

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.140 
over and I guess I can move on to my
next<00:06:34.710> let's<00:06:35.160> play<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:35.639> hopefully<00:06:35.910> it<00:06:36.000> won't

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
next let's play and hopefully it won't

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.480 
next let's play and hopefully it won't
take<00:06:36.240> me<00:06:36.480> a<00:06:36.510> month<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.810> finish<00:06:37.220> like<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.250> did

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
take me a month to finish like I did

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.090 
take me a month to finish like I did
