00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
well let's take out the big-time

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.060 
well let's take out the big-time
spider-man<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.410> guys<00:03:56.530> can<00:03:56.710> get<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.860> little

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
spider-man so you guys can get a little

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.680 
spider-man so you guys can get a little
comparison<00:03:57.460> here<00:03:57.850> again<00:03:58.210> already<00:03:58.420> did<00:03:58.660> a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
comparison here again already did a

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.590 
comparison here again already did a
review<00:03:58.990> on<00:03:59.050> this<00:03:59.320> guy<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.270> the

review on this guy so you can see the
differences<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:03.910> both<00:04:04.150> figures<00:04:04.660> like<00:04:04.810> as

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
differences with both figures like as

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.030 
differences with both figures like as
far<00:04:05.410> as<00:04:05.590> um<00:04:08.100> as<00:04:09.100> far<00:04:09.310> as<00:04:09.490> uh<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.830> like<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
far as um as far as uh like the like the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.470 
far as um as far as uh like the like the
paint<00:04:12.340> scheme<00:04:12.490> goes<00:04:12.880> because<00:04:13.270> it<00:04:13.390> is

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
paint scheme goes because it is

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.790 
paint scheme goes because it is
obviously<00:04:13.960> a<00:04:13.990> lot<00:04:14.170> different<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.590> mean<00:04:14.710> the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
obviously a lot different I mean the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.950 
obviously a lot different I mean the
figure<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.910> same<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.450> just<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.690> paint

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
figure is the same it's just the paint

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.550 
figure is the same it's just the paint
scheme<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:18.040> lot<00:04:18.310> different

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
scheme is a lot different

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.650 
scheme is a lot different

we'll get a big time Spidey out of the
way<00:05:27.169> do<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.470> little<00:05:27.680> size<00:05:27.890> side<00:05:28.370> comparison

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
way do a little size side comparison

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.480 
way do a little size side comparison
here<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.560> mean<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.590> still<00:05:30.890> like<00:05:31.039> this<00:05:31.190> figure

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
here I mean I still like this figure

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.610 
here I mean I still like this figure
though<00:05:31.640> but<00:05:32.570> we're<00:05:32.840> looking<00:05:32.960> at<00:05:33.200> the<00:05:33.289> big<00:05:33.470> time

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
though but we're looking at the big time

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.320 
though but we're looking at the big time
Spidey<00:05:33.979> so<00:05:34.250> that<00:05:34.400> tickle<00:05:34.700> a<00:05:34.760> ssin<00:05:34.940> on<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
Spidey so that tickle a ssin on the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.450 
Spidey so that tickle a ssin on the
figure<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.110> same<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:36.620> mean<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.100> head<00:05:37.280> can

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
figure is the same I mean the head can

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.240 
figure is the same I mean the head can
go<00:05:37.490> back<00:05:37.850> and<00:05:38.419> go<00:05:38.570> down<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:39.680> rotate<00:05:39.860> side<00:05:40.220> to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
go back and go down can rotate side to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.590 
go back and go down can rotate side to
side<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:42.289> does<00:05:42.440> have<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.710> app<00:05:42.860> crunch<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:44.390> goes

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
side it does have the app crunch it goes

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.690 
side it does have the app crunch it goes
down<00:05:45.140> pretty<00:05:45.320> far<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:45.770> goes<00:05:45.860> back<00:05:46.190> pretty<00:05:46.430> far

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
down pretty far it goes back pretty far

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.390 
down pretty far it goes back pretty far
the<00:05:47.479> arms<00:05:47.840> can<00:05:47.990> go<00:05:48.110> forward<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.410> back<00:05:48.650> in<00:05:49.220> and

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
the arms can go forward and back in and

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.110 
the arms can go forward and back in and
