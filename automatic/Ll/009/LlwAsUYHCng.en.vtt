3000<00:01:56.490> watt<00:01:56.700> battery<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.539> up<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.840> six<00:01:58.080> hours<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
3000 watt battery for up to six hours of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.270 
3000 watt battery for up to six hours of
usage<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:01.050> only<00:02:01.200> 10<00:02:01.440> millimeters<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
usage and it's only 10 millimeters I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.700 
usage and it's only 10 millimeters I
think<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.880> ultra<00:02:03.179> thin<00:02:03.420> move<00:02:04.289> 300<00:02:04.500> grams

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
think so it's ultra thin move 300 grams

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.030 
think so it's ultra thin move 300 grams

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
pre-installed apps the icons that we do

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.949 
pre-installed apps the icons that we do
a<00:02:38.130> little<00:02:38.400> bit<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.579> web<00:02:38.790> browsing<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:42.359> actually

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
a little bit of web browsing so actually

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.410 
a little bit of web browsing so actually
I<00:02:42.989> think<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.160> rear<00:02:45.060> camera<00:02:45.390> is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
I think that the the rear camera is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.390 
I think that the the rear camera is
actually<00:02:45.600> 2<00:02:45.900> megapixels<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.950> that's<00:02:47.100> even

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
actually 2 megapixels so that's even

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.199 
actually 2 megapixels so that's even
better<00:02:47.519> than<00:02:47.760> 1.2<00:02:49.400> again<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.519> has<00:02:50.670> dual<00:02:50.970> sim

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
better than 1.2 again this has dual sim

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.860 
better than 1.2 again this has dual sim
standby
