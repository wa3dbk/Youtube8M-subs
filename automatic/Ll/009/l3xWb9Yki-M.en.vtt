00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
down again and go so it sounds like this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.640 
down again and go so it sounds like this
oh<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:39.489> pretty<00:02:39.730> simple<00:02:39.909> then<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.319> anyway

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
oh it's pretty simple then so anyway

00:02:41.650 --> 00:03:03.480
