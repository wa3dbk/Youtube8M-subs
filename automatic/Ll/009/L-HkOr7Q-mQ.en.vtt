we'd<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.580> dealing<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.199> saddling<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.350> llama

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
we'd be dealing with saddling the llama

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.599 
we'd be dealing with saddling the llama
and<00:00:16.740> putting<00:00:17.039> panniers<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and putting panniers on this is a one of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.679 
and putting panniers on this is a one of
the<00:00:20.699> examples<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.769> resistance<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.980> llamas<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
the examples of resistance in llamas and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.040 
the examples of resistance in llamas and
and<00:00:25.130> you're<00:00:26.130> part<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.519> their<00:00:26.670> defense

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
and you're part of their defense

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.109 
and you're part of their defense
mechanism<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> notice<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> tied<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.910> guy

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
mechanism so you notice I tied this guy

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.590 
mechanism so you notice I tied this guy
up<00:00:30.300> fairly<00:00:30.779> close<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> tree<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.239> if

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
up fairly close to the to the tree or if

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
up fairly close to the to the tree or if
I<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> treeless<00:00:34.469> area<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.610> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
I was in a treeless area there would be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.130 
I was in a treeless area there would be
somebody<00:00:36.030> helping<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:36.989> be

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
somebody helping me and they would be

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
somebody helping me and they would be
hold<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.829> him<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.370> tight<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.969> give<00:00:39.149> them

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
hold with him really tight to give them

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
hold with him really tight to give them
too<00:00:39.629> much<00:00:39.930> lead<00:00:40.320> than<00:00:40.980> they'd<00:00:41.399> seven<00:00:41.790> natural

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
too much lead than they'd seven natural

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
too much lead than they'd seven natural
resistance<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.050> they'll<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.680> swinging

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
resistance and they'll start swinging

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
resistance and they'll start swinging
back<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.399> forth<00:00:44.640> either<00:00:45.030> even<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.629> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
back and forth either even with this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
back and forth either even with this
amount<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.770> still<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.190> swinging

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
amount there can still be some swinging

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.770 
amount there can still be some swinging
back<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.149> forth

back and forth
I<00:00:50.030> wish<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.239> llamas<00:00:51.750> could<00:00:52.230> stand<00:00:52.680> still

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I wish all my llamas could stand still

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.709 
I wish all my llamas could stand still
with<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.420> no<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:55.230> no<00:00:55.440> lead<00:00:55.680> rope<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.719> but

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
with with no with no lead rope on but

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
with with no with no lead rope on but
mine<00:00:58.350> aren't<00:00:58.620> trained<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.309> when<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
mine aren't trained to do that when you

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.650 
mine aren't trained to do that when you
have<00:01:00.420> 30-plus<00:01:01.140> llamas<00:01:01.760> that's<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:03.300> that's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
have 30-plus llamas that's that's that's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.120 
have 30-plus llamas that's that's that's
a<00:01:04.010> lot<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> extra<00:01:05.280> training<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.000> anyway<00:01:07.130> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
a lot of extra training so anyway so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
a lot of extra training so anyway so
what<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.479> basically<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.229> couple<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
what I have basically a couple of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.880 
what I have basically a couple of
different<00:01:11.040> styles<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:12.020> saddles<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.740> all

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
different styles of saddles this is all

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730 
different styles of saddles this is all
a<00:01:13.920> Soper<00:01:14.610> system<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a Soper system is what I use out of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
a Soper system is what I use out of
Colorado<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Colorado I really like that the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.990 
Colorado I really like that the
stability<00:01:18.710> is<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> main<00:01:20.430> thing<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> like

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
stability is is the main thing I like

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.499 
stability is is the main thing I like
and<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.159> saddles<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.330> hard

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and and the saddles that the hard

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
and and the saddles that the hard
especially<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.930> hard<00:01:25.110> saddles<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.979> carry<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
especially the hard saddles can carry a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.410 
especially the hard saddles can carry a
really<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.360> good<00:01:27.600> good<00:01:27.990> sized<00:01:28.229> load<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
really really good good sized load so I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.080 
really really good good sized load so I
have<00:01:30.689> different<00:01:31.229> styles<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> saddles<00:01:32.549> they

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
have different styles of saddles they

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.060 
have different styles of saddles they
all<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> same<00:01:33.750> strap<00:01:34.290> system<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
all have the same strap system which is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.480 
all have the same strap system which is
the<00:01:35.250> most<00:01:35.460> confusing<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> beginning<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
the most confusing at the beginning so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
the most confusing at the beginning so
but<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> strap<00:01:38.850> systems<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> same<00:01:39.720> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
but the strap systems are the same so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.399 
but the strap systems are the same so
this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.710> an<00:01:41.130> example<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.479> Sopris<00:01:42.930> lumbar

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this is an example of the Sopris lumbar

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
this is an example of the Sopris lumbar
and<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> soft<00:01:44.909> saddle<00:01:45.299> system<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.840> like

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and this is a soft saddle system I like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.480 
and this is a soft saddle system I like
this<00:01:47.000> for<00:01:50.360> for<00:01:51.360> my<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:52.350> medium<00:01:52.740> size<00:01:52.979> llamas

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this for for my more medium size llamas

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
this for for my more medium size llamas
it's<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.750> adequate<00:01:55.079> system<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's a it's a very adequate system and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's a it's a very adequate system and
it<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:57.240> still<00:01:57.479> quite<00:01:57.780> stable<00:01:58.079> when<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.770> get

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it it's still quite stable when you get

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.069 
it it's still quite stable when you get
up<00:01:59.159> above<00:01:59.610> fifty<00:02:00.000> pounds<00:02:00.420> fifty<00:02:00.750> fifty-five

pounds

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.270 
pounds
it's<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.369> stable<00:02:03.590> even<00:02:04.590> though<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> not

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's very stable even though this is not

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's very stable even though this is not
one<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.549> medium<00:02:05.969> sized<00:02:06.180> llamas<00:02:06.600> though<00:02:07.049> but

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
one of my medium sized llamas though but

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
one of my medium sized llamas though but
it'll<00:02:07.770> it'll<00:02:07.920> fit<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.610> lungs<00:02:08.849> same<00:02:09.629> with

the hard packs all

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.390 
the hard packs all
Sammis<00:02:12.660> we'll<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.020> fit<00:02:13.260> different<00:02:13.680> different

so<00:02:16.320> these<00:02:16.470> uses<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> belly<00:02:17.430> strap<00:02:17.790> there's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so these uses the belly strap there's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:29.590 
so these uses the belly strap there's
two<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.360> them<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:24.060> put<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.650> butt<00:02:25.890> strap

sometimes too much help is it gets in
the<00:05:11.250> way<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:12.000> once<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.900> get<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.169> panniers<00:05:13.590> off

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
disconnect from one side you start

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.830 
disconnect from one side you start
disconnecting<00:05:20.070> from<00:05:20.639> both<00:05:20.789> sides<00:05:21.060> that's<00:05:21.630> how

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
disconnecting from both sides that's how

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:35.360 
disconnecting from both sides that's how
stuff<00:05:22.110> gets<00:05:22.139> lost<00:05:30.979> nice<00:05:31.979> and<00:05:32.220> tight<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:34.370> and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
and just go on the saddle so there's a

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.480 
and just go on the saddle so there's a
metal<00:05:47.020> bar<00:05:47.260> right<00:05:47.590> here<00:05:48.040> goes<00:05:49.030> on<00:05:49.210> these<00:05:49.330> hooks

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
metal bar right here goes on these hooks

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.150 
metal bar right here goes on these hooks
there<00:05:51.490> is<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.760> strap<00:05:52.420> that<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.410> thread<00:05:53.800> through

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
there is a strap that you thread through

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:05.280 
there is a strap that you thread through
right<00:05:54.460> here<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:56.980> helps<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:04.840> course<00:06:04.900> this

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
right here and that helps of course this

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.590 
right here and that helps of course this
is<00:06:05.470> easier<00:06:05.860> than<00:06:05.920> I'm<00:06:06.250> making<00:06:06.610> it<00:06:06.730> look<00:06:06.970> but
