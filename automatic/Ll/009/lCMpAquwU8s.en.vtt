 because until the controls should there around the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.599
 blue chips how do we get to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 Everything starts fire evolution 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.079
 ultimate departed among campers 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.539
 Mexican is what happens 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.030
 Tomorrow big bag of today thinks the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.289

 mask the opponents red a circle as 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 while substantive already 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.400
 ridiculous but shit for now 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.810

 in the morning but enough of this 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 ridicule of statements come 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 we would rather quickly first map map 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.610
 Assassin's creed it on this map 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.580
 grenade not two neither 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.750
 Workers around my god always have this cellphone 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 looking for someone probably has jack sparrow 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.380
 speed dial true to the motto 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 Call press the button and it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.430
 comes ghost pirate was perfect finds 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.360
 that is you that is your idea for 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 rescue the call of duty franchise 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.250
 player brainstorm ghost pirates 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.250
 it did not look like the ship 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.659
 Ghost driver drives directly in front of the wall 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.710
 ghost pirates such a cost busters 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.570
 shit that is not special 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 witty so i have to say i 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.430
 I am definitely not for my part 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:56.640
 But we're crazy about it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.469
 get favela olé olé olé 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.490
 hopefully he will not risk it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.600
 so much broken but you can see it already 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.920
 was a great adaptation for the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 chain was a tv in the bar 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.729
 built to camp with 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 not too long and it would be 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.239
 Of course not correct cost if it 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.150
 no thermal give but this time out 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.200
 the 130th 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.099
 finally a cool idea and such a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 Of course there's also a station back 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.920
 again for all who cares about him 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.910
 pandora we discover one about namely 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.560
 whole things 3d printers from 36 and 14 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.269
 the whole in the trade first on 620 ps 42 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.739
 years later quite what he was 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.980
