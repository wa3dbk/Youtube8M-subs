00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
24/7 long strand hay is gonna do its

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.500 
24/7 long strand hay is gonna do its
very<00:02:19.780> best<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.230> prevent<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:21.030> some<00:02:22.030> pigs<00:02:22.299> I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
very best to prevent this some pigs I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020 
very best to prevent this some pigs I
know<00:02:22.569> can<00:02:23.019> still<00:02:23.409> possibly<00:02:24.159> get<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.489> occlusion

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
know can still possibly get my occlusion

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.199 
know can still possibly get my occlusion
even<00:02:25.810> though<00:02:25.930> they're<00:02:26.109> on<00:02:26.230> lots<00:02:27.129> of<00:02:27.280> hay<00:02:27.489> but

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
even though they're on lots of hay but

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.360 
even though they're on lots of hay but
it's<00:02:28.359> rare<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:28.900> would<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.379> something

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
it's rare it would just be something

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.849 
it's rare it would just be something
that<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.579> can't<00:02:30.790> control<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.629> anyway<00:02:31.959> as<00:02:32.319> for

that you can't control and anyway as for

the rest of the piggies hey hey hey hey

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.369 
the rest of the piggies hey hey hey hey
now<00:02:36.489> make<00:02:37.269> sure<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:37.599> long<00:02:37.780> strand<00:02:38.200> hay

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
now make sure it's long strand hay

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.170 
now make sure it's long strand hay
because<00:02:38.709> as<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:38.950> said<00:02:39.159> that<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.549> what<00:02:39.819> grinds

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
because as I said that is what grinds

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.399 
because as I said that is what grinds
our<00:02:40.299> teeth<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.719> if<00:02:41.019> you're<00:02:41.200> feeding

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
our teeth down if you're feeding

from Oxbow or little hay cubes that's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.110 
from Oxbow or little hay cubes that's
not<00:02:47.530> gonna<00:02:47.650> be<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.980> same<00:02:48.129> thing<00:02:48.189> that<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.879> not

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
not gonna be the same thing that is not

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
not gonna be the same thing that is not
an<00:02:49.389> alternative<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:50.409> is<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.980> little

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
an alternative that is just a little

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.119 
an alternative that is just a little
snack<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.870> when<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.200> little<00:02:53.500> teeny<00:02:53.859> pieces

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
snack like when it's little teeny pieces

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.949 
snack like when it's little teeny pieces
of<00:02:54.400> compressed<00:02:54.819> hay<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.269> that's<00:02:55.450> super<00:02:55.930> easy

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
of compressed hay and that's super easy

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.599 
of compressed hay and that's super easy
for<00:02:56.230> them<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> eat<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.430> not

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
for them to eat and that is not

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.589 
for them to eat and that is not
requiring<00:02:58.090> their<00:02:58.569> jaw<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.980> grind<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.669> down<00:03:00.700> so

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
requiring their jaw to grind it down so

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.179 
requiring their jaw to grind it down so
it<00:03:01.689> has<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.079> be<00:03:02.169> long<00:03:02.379> strand<00:03:02.709> hay

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
it has to be long strand hay

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.190 
it has to be long strand hay
now<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.819> your<00:03:03.970> piggies<00:03:04.299> are<00:03:04.480> six<00:03:04.780> months<00:03:05.079> or

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
now if your piggies are six months or

alfalfa<00:03:12.939> hay<00:03:13.090> because<00:03:13.329> that's<00:03:13.540> too<00:03:13.750> high<00:03:13.930> in

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
alfalfa hay because that's too high in

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.219 
alfalfa hay because that's too high in
calcium<00:03:14.879> so<00:03:15.879> I<00:03:15.909> think<00:03:16.329> timothy<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:16.959> probably
