00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
that were in two of the rolling things

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.290 
that were in two of the rolling things
those<00:03:19.260> plastic<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.130> rolling<00:03:20.640> bands<00:03:21.000> the

those plastic like rolling bands the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.479 
those plastic like rolling bands the
inside<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.800> have<00:03:23.010> room<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> grow

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
inside of here and I have room to grow

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.770 
inside of here and I have room to grow
because<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.880> drawer<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.450> kind<00:03:24.660> of

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
because that drawer is just kind of

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.430 
because that drawer is just kind of
random<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.570> that's<00:03:27.570> roughly<00:03:27.750> how<00:03:28.050> big<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.350> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
random so that's roughly how big it is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.910 
random so that's roughly how big it is
it's<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:29.070> kind<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.910> size<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.690> an<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.680> just

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it's a kind of the size of an of just

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's a kind of the size of an of just
like<00:03:32.070> an<00:03:32.220> average<00:03:32.459> desk<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.860> drawers<00:03:35.160> are
