00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
formerly of the Oakland Raiders they

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.700 
formerly of the Oakland Raiders they
signed<00:00:20.460> him<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> five-year<00:00:21.350> 35<00:00:22.350> million

signed him to a five-year 35 million
dollar<00:00:23.070> deal<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.699> certainly<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> little<00:00:24.900> bit

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
dollar deal and certainly a little bit

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.710 
dollar deal and certainly a little bit
surprising<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> me<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.220> he<00:00:26.820> gets<00:00:27.119> less<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
surprising to me that he gets less of a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.859 
surprising to me that he gets less of a
contract<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> Roger<00:00:28.680> Saffold<00:00:29.429> who<00:00:29.970> goes<00:00:30.269> to

informally mention Raiders at
eight-and-a-half<00:00:33.270> million<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.780> year<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:33.989> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
eight-and-a-half million a year so I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.500 
eight-and-a-half million a year so I
think<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.500> look<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
think if you look at it like that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.910 
think if you look at it like that

Eugene<00:00:43.710> Monroe<00:00:44.100> signs<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.300> it'd

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Eugene Monroe signs for but I think it'd

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
Eugene Monroe signs for but I think it'd
be<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.719> nine<00:00:45.899> million<00:00:46.200> dollar<00:00:46.530> range<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
be in that nine million dollar range I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.470 
be in that nine million dollar range I
think<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
think you have to look at it like the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
think you have to look at it like the
Cardinals<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> best<00:00:49.410> bargain<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.129> in

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
Cardinals got the best bargain here in

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
Cardinals got the best bargain here in
free<00:00:50.910> agency<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> left<00:00:52.020> tackles<00:00:52.500> he's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
free agency of all the left tackles he's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.799 
free agency of all the left tackles he's
a<00:00:52.980> solid<00:00:53.399> player<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> solidify

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
a solid player that's going to solidify

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
a solid player that's going to solidify
that<00:00:55.260> blind<00:00:55.530> spot<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.980> Carson<00:00:56.370> Palmer<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that blind spot for Carson Palmer the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
that blind spot for Carson Palmer the
left<00:00:57.449> tackle<00:00:57.660> spot<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.500> important<00:00:59.010> position

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
left tackle spot an important position

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
left tackle spot an important position
anyway<00:00:59.820> never<00:01:00.359> mind<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> play<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
anyway never mind when you play in a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
anyway never mind when you play in a
division<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> NFC<00:01:02.340> West<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
division like the NFC West which is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
division like the NFC West which is
where<00:01:03.539> vel<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> headed<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.189> those

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
where vel here is headed with all those

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
where vel here is headed with all those
premium<00:01:05.820> pass<00:01:06.000> rushers<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.750> division<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
premium pass rushers in that division so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.350 
premium pass rushers in that division so
I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.250> Cardinals<00:01:08.670> were<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.939> said<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I think the Cardinals were all said and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050 
I think the Cardinals were all said and
done<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> young<00:01:10.740> guy<00:01:10.950> still<00:01:11.790> well

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
done you get a young guy still well

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
done you get a young guy still well
within<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> prime<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> his<00:01:13.049> career<00:01:13.229> age<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
within the prime of his career age is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
within the prime of his career age is
not<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> concern<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.390> tremendously

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
not a concern and I was tremendously

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
not a concern and I was tremendously
productive<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.740> 2012<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> fact

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
productive in 2012 and I like the fact

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
productive in 2012 and I like the fact
that<00:01:19.350> he<00:01:19.619> came<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.759> steady<00:01:21.119> last

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that he came back was pretty steady last

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
that he came back was pretty steady last
year<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.530> last<00:01:22.740> four<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.220> five<00:01:23.400> games

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
year in the last four or five games

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
year in the last four or five games
coming<00:01:24.210> back<00:01:24.390> from<00:01:24.689> his<00:01:24.810> injury<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.380> his

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
coming back from his injury of his

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.270 
coming back from his injury of his
triceps

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
triceps

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
triceps
I<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.700> worry<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.119> triceps<00:01:27.720> injury

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
I don't worry about a triceps injury

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
I don't worry about a triceps injury
lagging<00:01:28.560> obviously<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.790> sure<00:01:29.970> if

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
lagging obviously so I'm not sure if

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719 
lagging obviously so I'm not sure if
that<00:01:30.270> hurt<00:01:30.570> belt<00:01:31.110> here's<00:01:31.409> market<00:01:31.920> value<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that hurt belt here's market value but I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
that hurt belt here's market value but I
look<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.119> him<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.360> being<00:01:33.509> every<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
look at him as being every much the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
look at him as being every much the
player<00:01:34.590> Saffold<00:01:35.520> did<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
player Saffold did so it's a little

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.399 
player Saffold did so it's a little
confusing<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> Raiders<00:01:37.829> decided<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> do

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
confusing what the Raiders decided to do

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.440 
confusing what the Raiders decided to do
