00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.130
 Hey. Joltter from Unisport WebTV. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.550
 And today we are in London with the only one: Christian Eriksen. 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.680
 Thank you for meeting us. 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 So, the brand new Nike Magista, 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.550
 - What do you think about the boot first? 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420
 I was really surprised when I first saw it. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.000
 They really surpassed themselves with this new style. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.680
 But I'm really impressed by the new boot. 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.970
 What does the Magista offer for your game? 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.640
 It is of course an extra sock, so you don't really feel it, you just know that you have it. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.000
 And I think it gives me more control over the ball and how to react to the track. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.840
 If we talk generally about soccer boots, - 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.750
 - How much does your boots mean for you on the pitch? 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.150
 The color really doesn't matter. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.930
 It is clear that the first time you say you can see the yellow boot no matter where you are, - 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 - so even if you look straight out, you will still be able to see the yellow boot, but - 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.150
 - If you like the style and the comfort then it is enough for me. Then it's just as much with the color. 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.730
 What about low weight? 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.400
 That is, of course, an important thing. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.020
 I like it when it's light and as soft as possible, so you get a good touch with the ball. 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 Yes for me it is better when it is easy. 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.330
 Are your own boots custom made or personalized in any way? 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 My vapor was actually a couple of times because I had trouble with my toe so they changed it a bit. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.460
 But the latest couples have just been in my normal size and a normal boot. 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.880
 What about names or flags? 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.750
 I always have the Danish flag on one side and my name on the other side. 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 So if people do not know that I am from Denmark then they can look at the boot and of course also see my name. 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.800
 How does a normal day look like a young Premier League player? 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.750
 A normal day - I actually think it is a bit boring for those who are watching. 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.040
 We train from 10.30. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.130
 So I probably leave my home around 9am. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.950
 We train about 1-2 hours and then train in the strength center, - 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.880
 - And then I'm probably at home around 2 pm, - 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.020
 - and for the rest of the day I might go out and get a coffee, go to the cinema or out and shop a little. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.530
 So yes, I'm happy with my life. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.950
 What about right now. How are you in Tottenham? 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 I'm pretty good at the moment. 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.220
 It has of course been a strange season with lots of ups and downs, - 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.060
 - but I just started here and I'm really happy to be here. And I'm happy to be in Tottenham. 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 Who would you say is "the fun" in the dressing room? 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 The funny? 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.770
 We have a Brazilian, Sandro, he's probably one of the funniest people I've met. 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.260
 It sounds good. 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.660
 You have also scored some goals at free kick through your career. Even this season. 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080
 Do you spend a lot of time training them? 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.420
 Yes I do. 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.420
 I've been doing it for years. 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.480
 I had some years when they didn't go in. Now, fortunately, they do. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.660
 But I have always been after training. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.600
 Almost every workout for a few shots at free kick - 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.800
 - and I just think I've done that, as long as I can remember. 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.460
 One last question: 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.570
 Many people stop for football when they reach teens - 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.200
 - because they get interest in girls and parties and all that kind of thing. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.750
 But what kept you motivated? 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.240
 I don't know what kept me motivated, 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.370
 - I just think I liked football more than I liked the girls and the parties at the start. 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.570
 Football was just my thing. 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.440
 I just think I was more focused on football than parties. 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.530
 But I think only you get better if you enjoy what you do - 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.600
 - I think it helps your personal as well as your football life. 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.970
 Hi I am Christian Eriksen and you see Unisport WebTV.
