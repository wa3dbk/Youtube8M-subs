polycarbonate shield has the AFR or the
anti<00:00:56.399> fog<00:00:56.699> resistant<00:00:57.690> stuff<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.320> inside

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
anti fog resistant stuff right inside

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
anti fog resistant stuff right inside
and<00:00:58.980> pregnant<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.429> in<00:00:59.550> andaman<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.030> when

and pregnant right in andaman so when
you<00:01:00.269> go<00:01:00.390> through<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> process<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:02.059> making

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you go through the process of making

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.610 
you go through the process of making
this<00:01:03.149> mess<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.629> solution<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.050> actually<00:01:04.410> put

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
this mess the solution is actually put

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.890 
this mess the solution is actually put
into<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> end<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> plastic<00:01:06.120> itself<00:01:06.390> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
into the end of the plastic itself so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
into the end of the plastic itself so
they<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.260> maintenance<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> lot

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
they say maintenance on this is a lot

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
they say maintenance on this is a lot
lower<00:01:08.670> than<00:01:08.790> any<00:01:09.210> other<00:01:09.330> mask<00:01:09.990> company<00:01:10.350> that's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
lower than any other mask company that's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.070 
lower than any other mask company that's
our<00:01:10.650> shield<00:01:10.860> companies<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.870> it<00:01:12.870> comes

our shield companies out there it comes
with<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> kit<00:01:13.980> look<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.180> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
with in the kit look for you here it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.150 
with in the kit look for you here it
comes<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
comes with two little actually for a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.920 
comes with two little actually for a
little<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.520> two<00:01:17.670> different<00:01:17.820> sizes<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
little there's two different sizes to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.760 
little there's two different sizes to
adapt<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.740> any<00:01:20.100> helmet<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.470> oakley<00:01:22.470> actually

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
adapt to any helmet and oakley actually

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.290 
adapt to any helmet and oakley actually
just<00:01:22.950> started<00:01:23.070> putting<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:23.970> their

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
just started putting this into their

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.000 
just started putting this into their
helmets<00:01:24.690> probably<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.680> more<00:01:25.830> than

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
helmets probably a little bit more than

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.730 
helmets probably a little bit more than
a<00:01:26.070> year<00:01:26.100> ago<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.210> prevents<00:01:27.680> when<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
a year ago and that prevents when you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.140 
a year ago and that prevents when you
put<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.010> on<00:01:29.040> certain<00:01:29.370> helmets<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> helmet

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
put it on certain helmets if the helmet

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
put it on certain helmets if the helmet
is<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.330> wide<00:01:30.540> enough<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:31.260> boeing<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> sin

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is not wide enough from boeing to sin

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
is not wide enough from boeing to sin
and<00:01:32.010> that's<00:01:32.640> where<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.090> breakage<00:01:33.510> can

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and that's where a lot of breakage can

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
and that's where a lot of breakage can
occur<00:01:33.960> especially<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.890> where<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.280> where

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
occur especially here where you where

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.750 
occur especially here where you where
you<00:01:36.440> mount<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.950> shield<00:01:38.400> onto<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
you mount that the shield onto the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.520 
you mount that the shield onto the
helmet<00:01:39.030> there's<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.330> screws<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.870> which<00:01:40.320> can

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
helmet there's two screws here which can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.840 
helmet there's two screws here which can
actually<00:01:40.830> can<00:01:40.980> let<00:01:41.130> them<00:01:41.250> ask<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.700> be

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
actually can let them ask you to be
