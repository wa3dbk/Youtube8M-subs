00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 fueled with gasoline ie does not 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 to know how the big ethanol goes 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.409
 strange newness the 2.5 flex is the same 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.479
 used in the new rangers and was developed 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.720

 and 167 with less gasoline but 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.830
 also less dollar signs than the top model 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.860
 line titanium with 2.0 turbo engine the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 ninety two thousand nine hundred and ninety 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.530
 real 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 the optional sunroof is 14 thousand a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 same automatic transmission of six 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.400
 speeds with option to change in mode 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.190
 sequential so that the price of the new 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.220
 Fusion with 2.5 flex motor Decrease 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.350
 some attractions have not 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.179
 there is no radar that keeps distance from the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.990
 vehicle ahead with alert 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.670
 collision 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.710
 nor the system that warns the driver 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.329
 when the car leaves the bearing range 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.749
 Another difference is that only traction 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.689
 front of the start button nothing like 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.679
 a richer brother the flex version only turns on 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.899
 in the key 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 with abs jump starting assistant 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.619
 but with all this technological support the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.990
 fusion engine could 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 very well be manufactured in outdated 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.700
 the cold starting stub does not 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.310
 liked this big sedan so stay 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.780

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.120
 A little you'll meet one 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.040
 small but brave 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.560
 the new chevrolet prism that arrives for 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.630
 fight in the highly disputed segment of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.090
