00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello and welcome to the product of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 week or to the recommendation of the week there 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 I now change a lot of my concept 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.340
 I would like almost 1000 already 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 Subscribers on this channel 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 I want something here together 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.529
 Raise quality of the videos 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.060
 if it is noticed some is the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.199
 Camera quality a little better here 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.580
 again for comparison the old camera 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 quality that is the quality of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 Another camera in my opinion also one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 Nice quality but you can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.150
 to find a German difference 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 and it depends on the subtleties in the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.340
 live on 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 because my audience on this channel so 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.460
 Of course I want to grow strongly 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500
 also adapt my channel to it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 that means I will continue , of course 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.770
 make online blogs because there are so many 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 But people like the recommendation of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.570
 week I would like to expand something 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.280
 That's why I now also recommend 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 the week and me product of the week because 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.610
 Maybe a product is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.140
 food maybe 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 care products but with the recommendation of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 I also want to be people 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.789
 imagine 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
 i would like to introduce organizations 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 wants other vegan youtube channels 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 Imagine and continue to eat 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 care products and so on I have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.969
 the two last top are not coming now 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.189
 to forget 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.659
 Waving cheese alternatives and petersch 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.500
 will definitely be an issue in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.240
 follow the next one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 but in this episode I want you 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 first imagine a channel 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.479
 really worth seeing has always been me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 Again I should go to the blogs 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 cook and show me like this all over 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.520
 Do dishes and that's what I have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.900
 really found a top channel and the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.869
 I would like to introduce you now 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.740
 it is about istat with his show 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 cook vegan 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 he makes regular cook videos and from 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.530
 everything is really sweet to sweet 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.750
 there 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 the creative ideas and even sets the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.329
 wish his subscribers 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 I am a big fan personally 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.770
 become and watch me his cooking videos 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.220
 regularly because he really everything super 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.930
 Simply explained and I think it is 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.759
 just a recipe for his videos 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.979
 to boil it as cooked by a cookbook 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.450
 is really successful yes announce 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.680
 show through the channel just once and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 then you can also create your own picture 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.710
 do 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.979
 a young man named one is stuck 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.459
 behind the vegan web cook show cooks 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.560
 vegan 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.660
 in addition to the diverse and easy 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 nachkochen which dishes on his 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.069
 Kanal presents creativity 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.220
 his videos in my opinion, too 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.959
 absolutely in the foreground his video cut 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 provides even more vitality in the 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.760
 videos this is usually about 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.800
 small details of my opinion but 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.390
 clearly to the charm of his videos 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:41.430
 contribute this enumerates or enumerate 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.100
 Snibble the ingredients simply to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.510
 that no boredom arises and one 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.200
 also at no point in the video that 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.820
 feeling has to keep pushing 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.400
 a really great idea was his video 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.570
 to topinambur this explained first 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.650
 particularities of this forgotten 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.290
 plant in connection has the spectator 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.880
 interactively the possibility to choose how 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
