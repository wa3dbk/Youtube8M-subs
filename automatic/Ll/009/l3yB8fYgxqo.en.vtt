00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.560
I am Elisenda Barrera, 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.780
I'm 40 years old and I am part of Can Vies, 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.980
which I squattered in with a group of people  

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.800
I lived in the house for four years.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.280
Those years were very intense, full of experiences,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.800
and I would not have traded them for anything

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.440
Tired of a city model, which mistreats its citizens 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.880
Some people say, “What we want is self-government” 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.400
Well, self-govern yourselves! But not in my house

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.560
 which is for everybody  

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.080
The district will always try to have a hand

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.340
on how the living spaces are administrated. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.380
It does not make sense that some of the collectives ask for privileges 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.340
and the rest of us we have to suffer and pay our places with lots of effort

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.600
If they do not understand that there is an unfair urban plan

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.580
that there is a need for municipal facilities 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020
and you cannot even plant the basic problem

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.520
I believe we cannot call this a negotiation 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.020
They behaved very well those kids

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.260
- Disastrous, there was a revolt, all the containers - A pitched battle.  

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.220
Things got very heated. Lot’s of police 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.240
and people beating the police with sticks and the police beating the people.
