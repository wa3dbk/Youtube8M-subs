years and Pinal and Santo Spirito and we
wanted<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.070> give<00:02:11.580> him<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.790> background<00:02:12.450> what

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
wanted to give him that background what

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.210 
wanted to give him that background what
would<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.560> were<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> person

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
would it be like if you were a person

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.580 
would it be like if you were a person
who<00:02:14.340> would<00:02:14.660> set<00:02:15.660> off<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.810> nuke<00:02:16.489> twice<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:18.590> seems

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
who would set off a nuke twice it seems

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.110 
who would set off a nuke twice it seems
a<00:02:19.709> pretty<00:02:19.890> intense<00:02:20.250> thing<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> single

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
a pretty intense thing for a single

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.780 
a pretty intense thing for a single
person<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.690> done<00:02:22.310> freeing<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.430> nation

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
person to have done freeing a nation

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.210 
person to have done freeing a nation
from<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.150> dictator<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:25.829> our<00:02:26.010> core

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
from a dictator that's that's our core

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.130 
from a dictator that's that's our core
development<00:02:26.760> within<00:02:26.910> Rico's<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.690> give<00:02:27.900> him

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
development within Rico's to give him

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.920 
development within Rico's to give him
that<00:02:28.350> real<00:02:29.130> grounding<00:02:29.820> we<00:02:30.329> look<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> Rico

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
that real grounding we look to Rico

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.350 
that real grounding we look to Rico
obviously<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.620> did<00:02:31.799> all<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.100> graphic<00:02:33.090> stuff

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
obviously we did all the graphic stuff

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.300 
obviously we did all the graphic stuff
that<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.630> wanted<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.560> prove<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that we wanted to do when you prove the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.430 
that we wanted to do when you prove the
amount<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.660> triangles<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.870> use<00:02:37.049> forums

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
amount of triangles that we use forums

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.130 
amount of triangles that we use forums
and<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.739> were<00:02:37.829> poly<00:02:38.130> count<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.140> updated

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
and there were poly count and updated

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560 
and there were poly count and updated
everything<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.769> his<00:02:40.920> hair<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.610> his<00:02:41.820> beard<00:02:42.450> to

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
everything from his hair to his beard to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.710 
everything from his hair to his beard to
his<00:02:43.440> outfit<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.760> all<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> little

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
his outfit and you know all the little

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.699 
his outfit and you know all the little
things<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.530> animate<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.070> him

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
things that we can animate on him

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.580 
things that we can animate on him
I<00:02:47.739> probably<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.459> over<00:02:48.690> 2,500<00:02:49.690> animations

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
I probably have over 2,500 animations

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.680 
I probably have over 2,500 animations
now<00:02:50.769> for<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.069> single<00:02:51.340> character<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.510> he's<00:02:52.659> a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
now for a single character but he's a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.470 
now for a single character but he's a
complex<00:02:53.500> character<00:02:53.799> he<00:02:54.489> could<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.879> anything

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
complex character he could do anything

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.550 
complex character he could do anything
anytime<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:58.480> wanted<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> ensure<00:02:59.049> that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
anytime and we wanted to ensure that

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.259 
anytime and we wanted to ensure that
responsiveness<00:03:00.190> was<00:03:00.549> still<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> part<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.120> that

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
responsiveness was still a part of that

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.910 
responsiveness was still a part of that
I<00:03:01.480> pulled<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.900> trigger<00:03:01.930> I'm<00:03:02.349> always<00:03:02.560> shooting

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
I pulled the trigger I'm always shooting

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.800 
I pulled the trigger I'm always shooting
no<00:03:03.159> matter<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.610> state<00:03:03.879> I'm<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.180> what<00:03:04.720> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
no matter what state I'm in what it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.699 
no matter what state I'm in what it
means<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.230> get<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:06.000> perfectly<00:03:07.000> fluid

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
means is you get this perfectly fluid

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.050 
means is you get this perfectly fluid
experience<00:03:08.709> through<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.250> world<00:03:09.459> we

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
experience through the world we

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.869 
experience through the world we
definitely<00:03:10.420> wanted<00:03:10.659> to<00:03:10.829> bring<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:12.220> sense<00:03:12.610> of

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
definitely wanted to bring a sense of

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.240 
definitely wanted to bring a sense of
groundedness<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.690> physicality<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.349> Rico<00:03:14.829> we

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
groundedness and physicality to Rico we

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.130 
groundedness and physicality to Rico we
wanted<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.610> give<00:03:15.760> him<00:03:15.879> real<00:03:16.120> weight<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.720> what

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
wanted to give him real weight in what

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.949 
wanted to give him real weight in what
he<00:03:17.260> was<00:03:17.379> doing<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:19.030> terms<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.480> animation

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
he was doing in terms of the animation

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.869 
he was doing in terms of the animation
tech<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.560> we<00:03:20.650> developed<00:03:21.099> and<00:03:21.340> also<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
tech that we developed and also the

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.339 
tech that we developed and also the
animations<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:22.660> were<00:03:22.720> using<00:03:22.900> real<00:03:23.140> motion

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
animations and we were using real motion

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.220 
animations and we were using real motion
capture<00:03:23.829> now<00:03:23.980> which<00:03:24.609> was<00:03:24.760> really<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.060> big<00:03:25.959> step

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
capture now which was really a big step

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.250 
capture now which was really a big step
up<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:27.430> terms<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.970> projects<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:28.599> what<00:03:29.140> we

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
up in terms of the projects but what we

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.690 
up in terms of the projects but what we
didn't<00:03:29.500> want<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.890> lose<00:03:30.160> was<00:03:30.489> the

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
didn't want to lose was the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.190 
didn't want to lose was the
responsiveness<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.569> didn't<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.049> lose

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
responsiveness we didn't want to lose

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.520 
responsiveness we didn't want to lose
his<00:03:32.560> ability<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:34.510> things<00:03:34.750> quickly<00:03:35.109> move

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
his ability to do things quickly move

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.550 
his ability to do things quickly move
quickly<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.810> was<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.959> big<00:03:38.109> challenge<00:03:38.290> to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
quickly and so it was a big challenge to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.309 
quickly and so it was a big challenge to
try<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.519> use<00:03:39.970> really<00:03:40.239> high<00:03:40.840> fidelity

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
try to use really high fidelity

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.559 
try to use really high fidelity
animation<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.400> motion<00:03:42.700> capture<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.359> still

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
animation and motion capture but still

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.509 
animation and motion capture but still
kind<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.019> keep<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.379> true<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.859> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
kind of keep it true to the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.699 
kind of keep it true to the
responsiveness<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.480> fans<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:47.049> care

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
responsiveness that the fans really care

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.410 
responsiveness that the fans really care
about<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.400> first<00:03:48.609> thing<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:48.909> did<00:03:49.030> was<00:03:49.209> we

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
about the first thing that we did was we

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.180 
about the first thing that we did was we
took<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.599> look<00:03:49.750> at<00:03:49.870> Just<00:03:50.109> Cause<00:03:50.230> 2<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.010> was

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
took a look at Just Cause 2 so it was

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.289 
took a look at Just Cause 2 so it was
really<00:03:51.430> strong<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.790> grappling<00:03:52.120> with<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
really strong the grappling with the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.610 
really strong the grappling with the
parachute<00:03:52.690> all<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.930> type<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.109> stuff

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
parachute all that type of stuff

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.800 
parachute all that type of stuff
retain<00:03:54.579> what<00:03:54.790> was<00:03:54.880> really<00:03:55.269> really<00:03:55.480> cool<00:03:55.750> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
retain what was really really cool and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.080 
retain what was really really cool and
core<00:03:56.260> about<00:03:56.560> them<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.010> then<00:03:57.579> tried<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.790> figure

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
core about them and then tried to figure

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.120 
core about them and then tried to figure
out<00:03:58.209> ok<00:03:58.480> where<00:03:58.690> are<00:03:58.870> holes<00:03:59.139> now<00:03:59.410> right<00:03:59.980> and

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
out ok where are holes now right and

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.920 
out ok where are holes now right and
what<00:04:00.609> we<00:04:00.700> determined<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.630> wingsuit

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
what we determined is that the wingsuit

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.659 
what we determined is that the wingsuit
was<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.139> great<00:04:02.470> opportunity<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:03.010> press<00:04:03.310> rate

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
was a great opportunity to press rate

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.369 
was a great opportunity to press rate
there's<00:04:04.299> about<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.599> million<00:04:05.049> different<00:04:05.139> ways

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
there's about a million different ways

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.050 
there's about a million different ways
you<00:04:05.560> can<00:04:05.620> do<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.010> wingsuit<00:04:06.340> in<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.519> game<00:04:06.669> but

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
you can do and wingsuit in a game but

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.970 
you can do and wingsuit in a game but
what<00:04:07.329> we<00:04:07.450> had<00:04:07.599> to<00:04:07.720> figure<00:04:07.840> out<00:04:08.019> is<00:04:08.200> how<00:04:08.829> do<00:04:08.889> we

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
what we had to figure out is how do we

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.619 
what we had to figure out is how do we
get<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.459> working<00:04:09.910> really<00:04:10.090> well<00:04:10.359> with<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
get that working really well with the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.539 
get that working really well with the
existing<00:04:11.049> mechanics<00:04:11.379> that<00:04:11.500> we<00:04:11.560> have<00:04:11.769> just

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
existing mechanics that we have just

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.449 
existing mechanics that we have just
like<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:13.120> could<00:04:13.919> slingshot<00:04:14.919> your<00:04:15.220> way

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
like you could slingshot your way

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.759 
like you could slingshot your way
through<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.120> world<00:04:16.299> with<00:04:16.750> grappling<00:04:17.620> hook

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
through the world with grappling hook

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.550 
through the world with grappling hook
and<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.070> parachute<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.729> jc2<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.959> can<00:04:20.169> still

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
and the parachute in jc2 you can still

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.560 
and the parachute in jc2 you can still
use<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.400> grappling<00:04:21.609> hook<00:04:21.789> while<00:04:22.180> you're<00:04:22.479> in

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
use the grappling hook while you're in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.439 
use the grappling hook while you're in
the<00:04:22.690> wingsuit<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> more

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
the wingsuit so this is a more

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.360 
the wingsuit so this is a more
fast-paced<00:04:26.370> state<00:04:27.370> for<00:04:27.699> Rico<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:29.370> use

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
fast-paced state for Rico you can use

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.000 
fast-paced state for Rico you can use
your<00:04:30.580> grapple<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.449> grapple<00:04:32.349> anything<00:04:32.830> in<00:04:32.949> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
your grapple to grapple anything in the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.240 
your grapple to grapple anything in the
world<00:04:33.220> change<00:04:34.150> your<00:04:34.360> direction<00:04:35.250> go

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
world change your direction go

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.500 
world change your direction go
underneath<00:04:36.580> tunnels<00:04:37.210> between<00:04:37.960> buses<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.160> mean

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
underneath tunnels between buses I mean

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.060 
underneath tunnels between buses I mean
pretty<00:04:40.510> much<00:04:40.630> anything<00:04:41.080> I'm<00:04:41.680> not<00:04:41.770> sure

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
pretty much anything I'm not sure

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.279 
pretty much anything I'm not sure
there's<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.400> crisp<00:04:42.910> verbal<00:04:43.479> explanation<00:04:44.110> of

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
there's a crisp verbal explanation of

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.930 
there's a crisp verbal explanation of
why<00:04:44.500> it's<00:04:44.770> so<00:04:44.830> great<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.220> use<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> wingsuit

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
why it's so great to use the wingsuit

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.790 
why it's so great to use the wingsuit
but<00:04:46.690> it's<00:04:46.990> one<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.260> those<00:04:47.349> things<00:04:47.560> where<00:04:47.770> I

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
but it's one of those things where I

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.230 
but it's one of those things where I
think<00:04:47.979> once<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.310> hold<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:48.669> your<00:04:48.699> hands<00:04:49.120> and

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
think once you hold in your hands and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.670 
think once you hold in your hands and
you<00:04:49.389> kind<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.660> have<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:49.900> mental<00:04:50.260> mapping<00:04:50.440> it

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
you kind of have this mental mapping it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.500 
you kind of have this mental mapping it
oh<00:04:50.830> it's<00:04:51.039> generally<00:04:51.520> going<00:04:51.729> forward<00:04:52.300> and

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
oh it's generally going forward and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.129 
oh it's generally going forward and
being<00:04:52.690> able<00:04:52.870> to

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
being able to

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.619 
being able to
that<00:04:53.349> together<00:04:53.650> kind<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.610> creating<00:04:54.999> velocity

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
that together kind of creating velocity

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.659 
that together kind of creating velocity
and<00:04:55.930> being<00:04:56.379> able<00:04:56.469> to<00:04:56.590> use<00:04:56.889> those<00:04:57.099> velocities

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
and being able to use those velocities

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.219 
and being able to use those velocities
to<00:04:57.699> create<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> parachute<00:04:58.599> that<00:04:58.870> has<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.050> nice

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
to create a parachute that has a nice

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.200 
to create a parachute that has a nice
little<00:04:59.379> sequence<00:04:59.830> all<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.729> stuff<00:05:00.909> just<00:05:01.030> works

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
little sequence all the stuff just works

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.879 
little sequence all the stuff just works
really<00:05:01.569> nicely<00:05:01.900> together<00:05:02.259> that<00:05:02.499> was<00:05:02.620> just<00:05:02.770> a

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
really nicely together that was just a

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.580 
really nicely together that was just a
bunch<00:05:03.129> of<00:05:03.419> hundreds<00:05:04.419> of<00:05:04.539> iterations<00:05:04.659> on<00:05:05.289> the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
bunch of hundreds of iterations on the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.719 
bunch of hundreds of iterations on the
wingsuit<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.039> parachute<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.460> all<00:05:06.550> that's

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
wingsuit and parachute and all that's

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.459 
wingsuit and parachute and all that's
best<00:05:07.150> stuff<00:05:07.330> together<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.810> parachute<00:05:08.259> now

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
best stuff together the parachute now

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.309 
best stuff together the parachute now
allows<00:05:08.830> us<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.460> shoot<00:05:10.330> every<00:05:10.749> weapon<00:05:10.930> and

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
allows us to shoot every weapon and

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.200 
allows us to shoot every weapon and
transition<00:05:11.860> out<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.009> it<00:05:12.279> reel<00:05:12.580> back<00:05:12.819> in<00:05:13.060> and

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
transition out of it reel back in and

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.779 
transition out of it reel back in and
out<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.449> it<00:05:13.599> but<00:05:13.779> gives<00:05:14.529> Rico<00:05:14.979> a<00:05:15.009> whole<00:05:15.370> nother

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
out of it but gives Rico a whole nother

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.350 
out of it but gives Rico a whole nother
