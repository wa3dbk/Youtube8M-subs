00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.130
 clean the house if we do not find in 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.990
 no church that is complicated 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.020
 we would take a five-liter carafe 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.210
 of water well or spring or water 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 bottled to that five-gallon 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.380
 we are going to take a liter of water 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.690
 in that liter of water we are going to put three 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.309
 spoonfuls of salt if possible that of 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.379
 thick we move it we link it and when 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 let's put it in front of a candle 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.320
 white 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.410

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.510
 let's say sir I'm not worthy of that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.120
 enter in my house but a word from you 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.880
 will be enough to heal me, we go back to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 perform it with the hand in the heart 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 we have to visualize a violet light 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 that is within us that flows 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 by our hand towards the water we return 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 to repeat the same thing sir I'm not worthy of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.399
 that between seeds of a word of yours 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.860
 enough to heal it we take the water and 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.430
 we're going to add it to the five-pack 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.289
 liters which we move well and the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 we have ready to clean for 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.110
 scrub for what we want to perform 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.170
 to drink even but from there before 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.929
 get to scrub we set aside as a means 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.420
 liter of water in a glass cup no 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.300
 it has to be a special thing well 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 we will begin to scrub the house from the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.460
 end room for the room with 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 all open open windows that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.229
 come out all the bad remember that if 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 they want to do the prayer that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.330
 I have told you sir I am not worthy of you 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.190
 enter my house 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.430
 but a word of yours will suffice to sound 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.970
 I can do it when they arrive 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.210
 at the end open the door bring good if 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.160
 can pull and give it out 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.920
 perfect that they can not because they live in 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.250
 a floor you go and throw that water at 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.580
 vc throw in the chain and leaders in de 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.820
 that situation well we will take after the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.710
 water that we have left we will go room 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.750
 per room 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:32.190
 we will look for our fingers and in each 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.640
 window we will do three crosses father son and 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.250
 holy spirit and we close this window and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.740
 so on with all the windows 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.820
 then we will do it with the ports 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:48.060
 until the last exit door 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:51.270
 we open the door of the street and with 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.570
 our hands are going to do as not 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.970
 like we're not going to throw everything that's not 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.780
 we want from our house as if 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.900
 one we expel we move we clean and 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.490
 we close our door 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.830
 by the back door 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.660
 we put our fingers and we make three 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.080
 crosses father son and holy spirit 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.020
 supporting the hand and we say no evil 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.110
 You have permission to enter this house 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.000
 with authority because it is our temple 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:28.120
 it's where we live where we laugh we cry 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.010
 It is our temple and no one who comes with 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.930
 evil has the right to enter inside 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.940
 we can do this if we want 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.190
 every month every two months when we want 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.320
 we can also do it to clean 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.380
 to the people our children our 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.010
 couples what we want well so 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.230
 So if you have any doubt I dismiss 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.480
 I will be glad to assist you 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.409

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.090

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.150
 what you want but it is very simple 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.610
 remember that water purifies everything 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.670
 because we are 75 percent water 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.129
