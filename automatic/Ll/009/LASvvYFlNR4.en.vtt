they're<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.130> adding<00:02:59.340> another<00:02:59.970> mind

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
they're going to be adding another mind

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.600 
they're going to be adding another mind
to<00:03:00.450> wear<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:00.870> last<00:03:01.020> time<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.290> did<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:02.340> had

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
to wear because last time we did he had

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.150 
to wear because last time we did he had
a<00:03:02.640> mine<00:03:02.970> which<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.170> could<00:03:04.320> go<00:03:04.470> mine<00:03:04.740> store

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
a mine which you could go mine store
