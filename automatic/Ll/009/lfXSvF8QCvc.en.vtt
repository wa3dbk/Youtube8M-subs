with the lens hood that's what it looks

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.939 
with the lens hood that's what it looks
like<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.059> got<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> BMW<00:00:52.110> 49

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
like but I've also got a BMW 49

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
like but I've also got a BMW 49
millimeter<00:00:53.399> filter<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.020> system

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
millimeter filter on that that system

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
millimeter filter on that that system
enables<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> install<00:00:56.340> any<00:00:56.550> forty<00:00:56.910> nine

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

millimeter filter arm on there

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
millimeter filter arm on there
so<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.539> instead<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.050> using

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
so that's what I use instead of using

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.830 
so that's what I use instead of using
the<00:01:01.680> stock<00:01:02.100> lens<00:01:02.520> cap<00:01:03.769> like<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> Fuji<00:01:05.339> x100s

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the stock lens cap like the Fuji x100s

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.870

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
100 s has an excellent form factor and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
100 s has an excellent form factor and
build<00:01:09.390> quality<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.500> seems<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
focusing you know also while I'm here
let<00:01:49.680> me<00:01:49.829> show<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.310> switch<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.820> switch

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
let me show you this switch they switch

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
let me show you this switch they switch
these<00:01:52.140> around<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:52.950> easier<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> use

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
these around so it's much easier to use

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.530 
these around so it's much easier to use
most<00:01:54.540> people<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.380> AFS<00:01:56.420> which<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
most people will have it on AFS which is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.730 
most people will have it on AFS which is
on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:57.840> bottom<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
on the very bottom but if you want to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
on the very bottom but if you want to
flip<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> manual<00:01:59.430> focus<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.939> flip

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
flip it up to manual focus you just flip

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
flip it up to manual focus you just flip
it<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> very<00:02:00.630> top<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> middle

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it up to the very top and in the middle

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
it up to the very top and in the middle
is<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> AF<00:02:02.549> continuous<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> continuous

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
is the AF continuous and continuous

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
is the AF continuous and continuous
focusing<00:02:04.520> AFS<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> autofocus<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
focusing AFS is the autofocus in the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.210 
focusing AFS is the autofocus in the
single<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:09.629> continuous<00:02:10.229> mode<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.739> anyway<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
single not continuous mode but anyway so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.750 
single not continuous mode but anyway so
I<00:02:11.310> focus<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.940> put<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.330> manual<00:02:12.750> focus

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
I focus if I put it up to manual focus

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.390 
I focus if I put it up to manual focus
it's<00:02:14.390> got<00:02:14.659> a<00:02:14.690> new<00:02:14.930> system<00:02:15.470> where<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:16.099> can<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.370> a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
it's got a new system where you can do a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.570 
it's got a new system where you can do a
split<00:02:16.760> image<00:02:16.940> manual<00:02:17.540> focus<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:19.220> split

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
split image manual focus and this split

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580 
split image manual focus and this split
image<00:02:19.730> manual<00:02:20.360> focus<00:02:20.690> system<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.260> really

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
image manual focus system is really

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.710 
image manual focus system is really
quite<00:02:21.799> nice<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.420> aa<00:02:23.599> or

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
quite nice it's just like a like aa or

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
quite nice it's just like a like aa or
whatever<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.140> terms<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.650> seeing<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.280> see

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
whatever in terms of you seeing you see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.800 
whatever in terms of you seeing you see
the<00:02:25.549> double<00:02:25.849> image<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.360> hard<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.629> see<00:02:26.750> in

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
the double image it's hard to see in

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.479 
the double image it's hard to see in
this<00:02:26.900> video<00:02:27.049> but<00:02:27.200> look<00:02:27.680> at<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.950> top<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.280> that

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
this video but look at the top of that

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.180 
this video but look at the top of that
or<00:02:28.909> I'm<00:02:29.030> focusing<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.720> chair<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:31.010> I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
or I'm focusing on the chair and if as I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.130 
or I'm focusing on the chair and if as I
turned<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.700> focus<00:02:32.540> ring<00:02:32.690> which<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:32.989> right

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
turned the focus ring which is right

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.589 
turned the focus ring which is right
here<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:34.700> kind<00:02:34.879> of<00:02:34.940> see<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.150> go<00:02:35.269> in<00:02:35.450> and

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
here you can kind of see it go in and

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.420 
here you can kind of see it go in and
out<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:36.049> split<00:02:36.440> image<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.220> come

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
out of split image and then you can come

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.490 
out of split image and then you can come
into<00:02:37.580> focus<00:02:37.849> like<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.510> see<00:02:39.260> how<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
into focus like that see how the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.130 
into focus like that see how the
vertical<00:02:40.220> lines<00:02:40.400> line<00:02:40.700> up<00:02:40.879> that's<00:02:41.569> very<00:02:41.959> much

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
vertical lines line up that's very much

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.780 
vertical lines line up that's very much
like<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.349> rangefinder<00:02:42.680> camera<00:02:43.190> like<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> Leica

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
like a rangefinder camera like a Leica

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.390 
like a rangefinder camera like a Leica
and<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.780> manual<00:02:45.079> focus<00:02:45.379> on<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:45.680> compared<00:02:46.340> to

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
and the manual focus on this compared to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.059 
and the manual focus on this compared to
the<00:02:46.549> x100<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:47.510> much<00:02:47.750> faster<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.470> x100

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
the x100 is so much faster on the x100

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.280 
the x100 is so much faster on the x100
when<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.549> turn<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.030> when<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.810> turn<00:02:51.019> this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
when you turn this when you turn this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.440 
when you turn this when you turn this
focus<00:02:51.739> ring<00:02:51.920> it'd<00:02:52.160> be<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.459> you'd<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.209> turning

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
focus ring it'd be like you'd be turning

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.240 
focus ring it'd be like you'd be turning
it<00:02:53.629> for<00:02:53.840> ages<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.319> ages<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.650> ages<00:02:54.829> and<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
it for ages and ages and ages and it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.740 
it for ages and ages and ages and it
just<00:02:55.400> would<00:02:55.579> the<00:02:55.670> focus<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:56.359> seemed<00:02:56.569> very

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
just would the focus it just seemed very

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.420 
just would the focus it just seemed very
finicky<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.290> flaky<00:02:57.680> whereas<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.069> one<00:02:58.280> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
finicky and flaky whereas this one is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.729 
finicky and flaky whereas this one is
just<00:02:58.790> fast<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.329> mean<00:02:59.420> look<00:02:59.569> at<00:02:59.629> that<00:02:59.690> boom<00:03:00.530> you

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
just fast I mean look at that boom you

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.080 
just fast I mean look at that boom you
know<00:03:00.829> I<00:03:00.859> could<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:01.220> turn<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.790> within<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
know I could just turn it within a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.569 
know I could just turn it within a
couple<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.450> turns<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.900> I'm<00:03:03.019> there<00:03:03.379> it<00:03:04.370> is

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
couple of turns and I'm there it is

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.030 
couple of turns and I'm there it is
still<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.910> focus<00:03:05.120> by<00:03:05.450> wire<00:03:05.690> electronic<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
still a focus by wire electronic you

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.130 
still a focus by wire electronic you
know<00:03:07.160> focusing<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.269> it's<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.959> much

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
know focusing but it's really much

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.910 
know focusing but it's really much
improved<00:03:09.640> now<00:03:10.640> they've<00:03:10.819> also<00:03:11.030> improved<00:03:11.920> you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
improved now they've also improved you

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.170 
improved now they've also improved you
know<00:03:13.040> some<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.400> button<00:03:13.640> layout<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.060> stuff

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
know some of the button layout and stuff

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.449 
know some of the button layout and stuff
like<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.750> well<00:03:15.379> as<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.040> sensor<00:03:16.430> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
like that as well as the sensor I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.740 
like that as well as the sensor I
believe<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:16.910> an<00:03:17.060> updated<00:03:17.540> sensor<00:03:17.989> as<00:03:18.169> well

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
believe it's an updated sensor as well

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.539 
believe it's an updated sensor as well
also<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.079> silver<00:03:21.620> color<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.280> slightly

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
also the silver color of it is slightly

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.580 
also the silver color of it is slightly
different<00:03:22.819> as<00:03:23.090> well<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.450> more<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.810> darker

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
different as well it's more of a darker

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.250 
different as well it's more of a darker
silver<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.220> grey<00:03:25.819> silver<00:03:26.209> rather<00:03:26.630> rather

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
silver like a grey silver rather rather

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.620 
silver like a grey silver rather rather
than<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> silver<00:03:28.160> silver<00:03:28.519> but<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.480> not

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
than like a silver silver but it's not

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.610 
than like a silver silver but it's not
really<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:29.989> noticeable

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
really that noticeable

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.800 
really that noticeable
and<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:31.940> lever<00:03:32.209> here<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.569> little

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
and you know this lever here is a little

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.170 
and you know this lever here is a little
bit<00:03:32.900> different<00:03:33.200> too<00:03:33.489> also<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.700> believe<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
bit different too also I believe the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.539 
bit different too also I believe the
resolution<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.959> x100s<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:36.919> higher<00:03:37.250> as

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
resolution on the x100s is higher as

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.479 
resolution on the x100s is higher as
well<00:03:37.849> now<00:03:38.709> admittedly<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.859> don't<00:03:40.099> know<00:03:40.190> every

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
well now admittedly I don't know every

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.620 
well now admittedly I don't know every
single<00:03:40.669> differences<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.239> they've<00:03:41.419> made

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
single differences that they've made

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.170 
single differences that they've made
with<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.049> x100s<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.549> these<00:03:43.790> are<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> main

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
with the x100s but these are the main

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.789 
with the x100s but these are the main
differences<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.810> think<00:03:45.109> makes<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.590> a

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
differences that I think makes it a

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.710 
differences that I think makes it a
worthy<00:03:46.040> upgrade<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.940> camera<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.389> just<00:03:47.569> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
worthy upgrade the camera is just so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.339 
worthy upgrade the camera is just so
much<00:03:47.840> more<00:03:47.900> usable<00:03:48.500> now<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.950> more<00:03:49.370> fun<00:03:49.669> to<00:03:49.940> use

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
much more usable now and more fun to use

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.110 
much more usable now and more fun to use
this<00:03:51.349> camera<00:03:51.680> also<00:03:51.829> has<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.069> pretty<00:03:52.250> nice<00:03:52.489> HD

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
this camera also has a pretty nice HD

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.400 
this camera also has a pretty nice HD
video<00:03:53.450> mode<00:03:53.660> although<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.959> don't<00:03:54.200> use<00:03:54.380> that

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
video mode although I don't use that

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.250 
video mode although I don't use that
that<00:03:54.739> much<00:03:54.950> because<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.849> only<00:03:56.419> has<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.690> 35

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
that much because it only has the 35

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.920 
that much because it only has the 35
millimeter<00:03:57.790> fixed<00:03:58.790> focal<00:03:59.120> length<00:03:59.269> lens<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.870> I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
millimeter fixed focal length lens and I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.659 
millimeter fixed focal length lens and I
prefer<00:04:00.230> that<00:04:00.379> for<00:04:00.680> stills<00:04:00.980> rather<00:04:01.280> than<00:04:01.489> for

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
prefer that for stills rather than for

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.159 
prefer that for stills rather than for
video<00:04:01.879> for<00:04:02.060> video<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.329> tend<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.750> shoot<00:04:02.870> wider

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
video for video I tend to shoot wider

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.940 
video for video I tend to shoot wider
angle<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.700> this<00:04:04.849> does<00:04:05.030> not<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.799> X

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
angle so this does not have so the X

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.589 
angle so this does not have so the X
100's<00:04:07.519> does<00:04:07.730> not<00:04:07.879> have<00:04:08.090> interchangeable

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
100's does not have interchangeable

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.170 
100's does not have interchangeable
lenses<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:09.079> just<00:04:09.260> has<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:10.030> 35<00:04:11.030> millimeter

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
lenses it just has the 35 millimeter

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.390 
lenses it just has the 35 millimeter
equivalent<00:04:11.660> lens<00:04:12.169> which<00:04:12.349> is<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.650> really<00:04:13.220> great

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
equivalent lens which is a really great

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.849 
equivalent lens which is a really great
lens<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.120> sensor<00:04:14.269> combination<00:04:15.139> they've<00:04:15.709> done

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
lens and sensor combination they've done

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.400 
lens and sensor combination they've done
a<00:04:15.889> great<00:04:16.070> job<00:04:16.160> with<00:04:16.760> mixing<00:04:17.690> those<00:04:17.840> two<00:04:18.169> and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
a great job with mixing those two and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.979 
a great job with mixing those two and
the<00:04:19.400> image<00:04:19.729> files<00:04:20.000> out<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.389> this<00:04:20.690> camera

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
the image files out of this camera

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.100 
the image files out of this camera
really<00:04:21.680> rivaled<00:04:21.919> that<00:04:22.219> of<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.669> DSLR<00:04:23.210> in<00:04:23.450> fact<00:04:23.870> in

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
really rivaled that of a DSLR in fact in

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.690 
really rivaled that of a DSLR in fact in
many<00:04:24.320> instances<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.979> even<00:04:25.219> better<00:04:25.400> than<00:04:25.580> a

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
many instances is even better than a

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.700 
many instances is even better than a
DSLR

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
DSLR

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.050 
DSLR
because<00:04:26.919> of<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.160> fact<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
because of the fact that this is a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.730 
because of the fact that this is a
mirrorless<00:04:28.600> camera<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.410> don't<00:04:29.560> have<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
mirrorless camera so you don't have a

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.260 
mirrorless camera so you don't have a
shutter<00:04:30.039> and<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.400> mirror<00:04:30.639> moving<00:04:30.970> up<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.180> down

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
shutter and a mirror moving up and down

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.480 
shutter and a mirror moving up and down
causing<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> vibration<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.770> many<00:04:33.070> instances

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
causing a vibration so in many instances

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.340 
causing a vibration so in many instances
this<00:04:33.669> image<00:04:34.419> is<00:04:34.539> out<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.810> this<00:04:34.930> camera<00:04:35.169> can

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
this image is out of this camera can

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.350 
this image is out of this camera can
actually<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.740> sharper<00:04:36.190> than<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.759> a<00:04:36.850> DSLR

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
actually be sharper than that of a DSLR

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.320 
actually be sharper than that of a DSLR
yet<00:04:37.990> it's<00:04:38.199> a<00:04:38.289> pretty<00:04:38.470> small<00:04:38.650> camera<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:40.180> take

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
yet it's a pretty small camera to take

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.140 
yet it's a pretty small camera to take
with<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:40.630> anywhere<00:04:41.490> now<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.669> has<00:04:42.789> a<00:04:42.820> pretty

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
with you anywhere now it has a pretty

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.050 
with you anywhere now it has a pretty
extensive<00:04:43.840> menu<00:04:44.590> system<00:04:45.009> and<00:04:45.190> also<00:04:45.820> talking

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
extensive menu system and also talking

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.999 
extensive menu system and also talking
about<00:04:46.270> manual<00:04:46.810> focus<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.350> don't<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.889> use

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
about manual focus you don't have to use

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.529 
about manual focus you don't have to use
the<00:04:48.220> split<00:04:48.490> image<00:04:48.580> manual<00:04:49.060> focus<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.419> can

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
the split image manual focus you can

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.879 
the split image manual focus you can
actually<00:04:49.660> change<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.259> in<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.530> menu<00:04:50.740> system

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
actually change that in the menu system

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.980 
actually change that in the menu system
as<00:04:51.190> well<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> different<00:04:52.240> method<00:04:52.539> of<00:04:52.630> manual

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
as well to a different method of manual

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.140 
as well to a different method of manual
focus<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:54.009> I'll<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.280> scroll<00:04:54.639> through<00:04:54.940> here

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
focus but I'll just scroll through here

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150 
focus but I'll just scroll through here
you<00:04:55.360> can<00:04:55.479> kind<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.690> see<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> lot<00:04:56.139> of<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.380> you

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
you can kind of see a lot of the you

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.510 
you can kind of see a lot of the you
know<00:04:57.190> different<00:04:57.610> menu<00:04:57.880> options<00:04:57.910> here<00:04:59.400> and<00:05:00.400> are

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
know different menu options here and are

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.839 
know different menu options here and are
pretty<00:05:00.699> easy<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:00.940> figure<00:05:01.840> out<00:05:02.490> if<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.580> want<00:05:03.759> it

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
pretty easy to figure out if you want it

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.159 
pretty easy to figure out if you want it
to<00:05:03.940> go<00:05:04.030> into<00:05:04.210> any<00:05:04.389> one<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.570> these<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.780> can<00:05:04.900> use

difficult for me to show this to you in
the<00:05:13.870> video<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.410> just<00:05:14.590> like<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.250> x100<00:05:15.880> this

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
the video but just like the x100 this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.120 
the video but just like the x100 this
has<00:05:16.210> an<00:05:16.419> optical<00:05:16.900> viewfinder<00:05:16.930> in<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:17.979> as

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
has an optical viewfinder in here as

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.860 
has an optical viewfinder in here as
well<00:05:18.490> as<00:05:18.610> an<00:05:18.729> electronic<00:05:19.270> viewfinder<00:05:19.360> and

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
well as an electronic viewfinder and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.300 
well as an electronic viewfinder and
they've<00:05:20.199> made<00:05:20.349> some<00:05:20.500> great<00:05:20.710> improvements<00:05:20.860> to

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
they've made some great improvements to

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.040 
they've made some great improvements to
the<00:05:21.400> electronic<00:05:21.910> viewfinder<00:05:22.000> it's<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.630> much

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
the electronic viewfinder it's a much

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.830 
the electronic viewfinder it's a much
more<00:05:23.229> high<00:05:23.440> res<00:05:24.000> display<00:05:25.000> when<00:05:25.599> you<00:05:25.690> look

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
more high res display when you look

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.110 
more high res display when you look
through<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.169> so<00:05:26.470> that's<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.340> much<00:05:27.550> that's<00:05:28.030> a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
through it so that's a much that's a

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.300 
through it so that's a much that's a
nice<00:05:28.300> improvement<00:05:28.870> as<00:05:29.020> well<00:05:29.380> especially<00:05:29.919> when

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
nice improvement as well especially when

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.899 
nice improvement as well especially when
you're<00:05:30.430> using<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:30.970> a<00:05:31.120> manual<00:05:31.479> focus<00:05:31.870> mode

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
you're using it in a manual focus mode

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.460 
you're using it in a manual focus mode
so<00:05:33.909> this<00:05:34.030> has<00:05:34.210> been<00:05:34.360> my<00:05:34.419> quick<00:05:34.870> video<00:05:35.199> on<00:05:35.260> the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
so this has been my quick video on the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.350 
so this has been my quick video on the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
camera of this form factor

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.040 
camera of this form factor
you<00:05:45.430> know<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.580> might<00:05:45.820> consider<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.389> X<00:05:46.479> 100<00:05:46.900> s

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
you know you might consider the X 100 s

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.020 
you know you might consider the X 100 s
and<00:05:47.320> if<00:05:47.380> you<00:05:47.470> already<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.039> X<00:05:48.070> 100<00:05:48.699> you

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
and if you already have the X 100 you

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.640 
and if you already have the X 100 you
might<00:05:49.150> consider<00:05:49.330> selling<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.900> name<00:05:50.050> getting

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650

might consider selling a name getting
the<00:05:50.770> X<00:05:51.039> 100<00:05:51.520> s<00:05:51.639> because<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.180> doesn't<00:05:52.510> seem

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
the X 100 s because and it doesn't seem

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.839 
the X 100 s because and it doesn't seem
to<00:05:52.870> have<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.050> lot<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.349> the<00:05:53.530> quirks<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.699> X

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849

100 suffered from and this range finder
form<00:05:58.000> factor<00:05:58.449> is<00:05:58.479> really<00:05:58.900> a<00:05:58.930> form<00:05:59.139> factor<00:05:59.259> that

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
form factor is really a form factor that

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.439 
form factor is really a form factor that
I<00:05:59.620> really<00:06:00.070> like<00:06:00.220> and<00:06:00.340> appreciate<00:06:00.729> a<00:06:00.759> lot<00:06:00.970> for<00:06:01.270> a

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
figuring out which lens I want to use

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.510 
figuring out which lens I want to use
the<00:06:21.159> 35<00:06:21.580> millimeter<00:06:21.909> lens<00:06:22.449> is<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:23.370> focal<00:06:24.370> length

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
the 35 millimeter lens is a focal length

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.129 
the 35 millimeter lens is a focal length
that<00:06:24.669> I<00:06:24.699> really<00:06:25.000> like<00:06:25.180> for<00:06:25.449> most<00:06:25.570> of<00:06:25.720> my<00:06:25.780> photos

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
that I really like for most of my photos

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.290 
that I really like for most of my photos
anyway<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.889> in<00:06:27.190> fact<00:06:27.520> when<00:06:27.729> I<00:06:27.759> used<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.060> shoot

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
anyway and in fact when I used to shoot

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.659 
anyway and in fact when I used to shoot
Leica<00:06:28.539> M<00:06:28.840> cameras<00:06:29.409> I<00:06:29.560> pretty<00:06:30.070> much<00:06:30.159> used<00:06:30.550> the

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
Leica M cameras I pretty much used the

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.760 
Leica M cameras I pretty much used the
35<00:06:31.030> millimeter<00:06:31.270> lens<00:06:31.840> most<00:06:32.229> of<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.530> time

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
35 millimeter lens most of the time

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.159 
35 millimeter lens most of the time
anyway<00:06:33.099> so<00:06:33.280> not<00:06:34.180> having<00:06:34.479> interchangeable

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
anyway so not having interchangeable

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.110 
anyway so not having interchangeable
lenses<00:06:35.500> to<00:06:35.740> me<00:06:35.860> on<00:06:36.010> this<00:06:36.130> camera<00:06:36.430> is<00:06:36.729> not

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
lenses to me on this camera is not

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.629 
lenses to me on this camera is not
really<00:06:37.389> much<00:06:37.570> of<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.750> detriment

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
really much of a detriment

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.119 
really much of a detriment
the<00:06:39.120> high-res<00:06:39.689> image<00:06:40.080> files<00:06:40.349> out<00:06:40.620> of<00:06:40.770> this<00:06:40.889> are

the high-res image files out of this are

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.649 
the high-res image files out of this are
excellent<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:41.759> you<00:06:41.819> could<00:06:41.969> even<00:06:42.180> crop<00:06:42.419> them

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
excellent and you could even crop them

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.540
