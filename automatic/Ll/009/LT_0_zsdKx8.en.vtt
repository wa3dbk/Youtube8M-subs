think rockstar should have given more
than<00:01:23.970> main<00:01:24.060> characters<00:01:24.450> pets<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.200> example

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
than main characters pets for example

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
than main characters pets for example
Trevor's<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.010> maniac<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.880> he's<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.090> type<00:01:27.210> of
