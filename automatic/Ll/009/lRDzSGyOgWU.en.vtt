00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.879
 I think I want a little doing because rendition of It's a good audience a little graph 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.960
 When this 2010 years waiting for it this year of the last is now is because whether the graph d 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.880
 I think but 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.830
 Well it is a Yes It is usually the director just I think that made a graph Kedomo this 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 You are 3d layered 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.900
 Is many things I liter with such feeling is I Then Well the 3 d layer 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 Finally, wearing light or something You're in such a feeling that a person of the enemy sense of depth you will see 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 Because I can see flowers even if I give it up 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.930
 Well muzzles in such a way that may be it is is of itself after 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:45.030
 Toka it or change the in You're an angle because I wish how do I show it to Lou wind 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.970
 Also the Tteyuu to enhance the more s by the addition of Toka said write Well various You're doing 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.830
 I can do it 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.520
 I have one more pie chart I think that I want to explain your little bit of it 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:57.340
 I will 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.770
 First of all, from the new plane here , I was doing a little bit more and more 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.850
 I will make it here 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.960
 So this is just a woman entering in this form 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.070
 It is not resulting in a 52 if there 50% 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:16.640
 And put it on the right in a womanlike manner 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:22.370
 Yes I got up , and next time in the same way in the nerve plane, it will be yellow 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:27.800
 Yes it will be the same as yellow , so this is 30% this time too 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.090
 Please leave this to check x and y 32 32% 30% 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.390
 In this also go side by side in the same way as Ma 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.219
 I will line up more and more such lines 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 Yes it's alright, if you can create the graph ratio in this way, this time 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.210
 Well , create a new position like this 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.080
 If you make it by fitting it from the effect 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.280
 It's distortion-it's distortion-based polar coordinates 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.880
 From a rectangle I from here yes and I used this 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.220
 If so I say to the song a straight line going to think Gu' 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.760
 Yes, it 's a finished graph and it 's alright 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.360
 is not it 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.069
 I copy and duplicate two of the graph 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.019
 And if you duplicate it, the part that overlaps first is 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:19.519
 I'm going to marry yes and if I'm white in this way 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:23.240
 I Hyosho will come around in a yes woman such a form in the counter-clockwise 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:28.660
 In here, if I use the stencil that I also went to last time 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.660
 Gloss comes out in this way
