gonna<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> playthrough<00:00:51.210> whether<00:00:51.719> it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
gonna do a playthrough whether it's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.049 
gonna do a playthrough whether it's
however<00:00:52.320> many<00:00:52.680> player<00:00:52.980> maybe<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:53.910> wind

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
however many player maybe you don't wind

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
however many player maybe you don't wind
up<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.270> being<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> single<00:00:54.870> player<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.469> that's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
up just being a single player but that's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.450 
up just being a single player but that's
what<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.160> be

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
what it's gonna be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
what it's gonna be
so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> guess<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> start<00:00:57.590> game<00:00:58.590> stops<00:00:58.890> reminding

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
so I guess to start game stops reminding

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
so I guess to start game stops reminding
me<00:00:59.460> reminding<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.800> $30<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:02.039> guarantee<00:01:02.550> for

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
me reminding you $30 or guarantee for

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.960 
me reminding you $30 or guarantee for
your<00:01:03.539> brand-new<00:01:04.080> $60<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.369> figure<00:01:05.729> they

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
your brand-new $60 game so I figure they

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
your brand-new $60 game so I figure they
just<00:01:06.150> give<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> $30<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.320> they

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
just give you the $30 and then they

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200 
just give you the $30 and then they
should<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.159> put<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.119> he's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
should just put like I'm like when he's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.660 
should just put like I'm like when he's
going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.630> trade<00:01:09.900> games<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.950> Gamestop<00:01:11.490> they
