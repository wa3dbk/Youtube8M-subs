of problems I've been having and
sourcing<00:00:07.500> decent<00:00:08.429> pivots<00:00:08.849> within<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> UK<00:00:09.450> for

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440

using<00:00:10.769> them<00:00:10.950> folding<00:00:11.550> knives

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
using them folding knives

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.530 
using them folding knives
basically<00:00:14.009> all<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> could<00:00:14.490> find<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.299> sort

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

of<00:00:15.570> thing<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.900> these<00:00:16.049> three<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.680> think

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
of thing is these three a so I think

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
of thing is these three a so I think
this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.010> half<00:00:17.220> inch<00:00:17.840> you<00:00:18.840> know<00:00:18.869> nice<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> nicely

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this is half inch you know nice a nicely

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.720 
this is half inch you know nice a nicely
made<00:00:19.800> hardened<00:00:20.310> pivots<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.550> he

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
made hardened pivots but you know he

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.140 
made hardened pivots but you know he
just<00:00:23.910> went

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
just went

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.609 
just went
they<00:00:24.300> weren't<00:00:24.449> anywhere<00:00:24.900> near<00:00:25.019> big<00:00:25.410> enough

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
they weren't anywhere near big enough

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.759 
they weren't anywhere near big enough
for<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> project<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.630> had<00:00:28.500> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
pivot so I found a lot of people using

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
pivot so I found a lot of people using
those<00:00:35.280> ones<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> wanted<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
those ones and wanted to try something a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.049 
those ones and wanted to try something a
little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:36.899> different<00:00:37.410> than<00:00:38.059> obviously

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
little bit different than obviously

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.340 
little bit different than obviously
trouble<00:00:39.390> without<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.079> pay<00:00:40.290> an

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
trouble without if you know you pay an

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
trouble without if you know you pay an
international<00:00:41.070> post<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> then<00:00:41.809> customs<00:00:42.809> get

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
international post and then customs get

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
international post and then customs get

bought myself them these are oil light
bushings<00:01:07.049> basically<00:01:08.010> phosphor<00:01:08.430> bronze<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
bushings basically phosphor bronze and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.280 
bushings basically phosphor bronze and
you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.450> designed<00:01:11.540> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.840> sort<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you know designed you know for sort of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
you know designed you know for sort of
high-speed<00:01:15.200> applications<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> got<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.210> mean

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
high-speed applications and I got I mean

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
high-speed applications and I got I mean
they<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.659> its<00:01:18.810> selection<00:01:19.259> different<00:01:19.740> sizes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
they had its selection different sizes

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.780 
they had its selection different sizes
just<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.580> project<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.180> decided<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:22.790> male

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just for this project I decided a male

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.070 
just for this project I decided a male
external<00:01:24.049> buy<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> 1/2<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.670> Millwall<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
external buy with a 1/2 in Millwall so

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
external buy with a 1/2 in Millwall so
five<00:01:28.650> mil<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:29.909> total<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> significance

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
five mil in total and the significance

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
five mil in total and the significance
of<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> 5

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
of that is is that the you know the 5

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.420 
of that is is that the you know the 5
mil<00:01:32.970> hold<00:01:33.210> down<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> middle<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.170> young

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
mil hold down the middle is the young

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.380 
mil hold down the middle is the young
pilot<00:01:35.430> tapping<00:01:35.939> size<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.570> m6<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:40.100> basically

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
pilot tapping size for m6 so basically

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
pilot tapping size for m6 so basically
get<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> wrap<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
get one of these you want to wrap it in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.679 
get one of these you want to wrap it in
something<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.630> tried<00:01:46.380> him<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.329> Robert

something I tried him it was Robert

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.350 
something I tried him it was Robert

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.289 
properly or it would you know when I put
it<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> clutch<00:01:57.890> Chuck<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.850> teeth<00:02:00.119> of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it in the clutch Chuck that the teeth of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
it in the clutch Chuck that the teeth of
it<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.659> scratch<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.530> make<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.770> look

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it would scratch it and make it look

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670 
it would scratch it and make it look
like<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.960> haven't<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> hand<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like so I haven't have to hand it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.900 
like so I haven't have to hand it
some<00:02:04.890> Kevlar<00:02:05.490> felt<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:07.520> hadn't<00:02:08.520> tried<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.849> know

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
some Kevlar felt I hadn't tried you know

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.249 
some Kevlar felt I hadn't tried you know
cotton<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.390> things<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.840> old<00:02:10.050> leather

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
cotton and things like that old leather

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.510 
cotton and things like that old leather
that<00:02:10.530> might<00:02:10.739> work<00:02:10.950> but

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that might work but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.980 
that might work but
and<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.330> I've<00:02:12.390> got<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.630> some<00:02:12.780> easy

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and I think I've got there some easy

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.570 
and I think I've got there some easy
composites<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.770> years<00:02:14.040> ago<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
composites like years ago for a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.790 
composites like years ago for a
different<00:02:14.940> project<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.960> might<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.260> Kevlar

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
different project they might have Kevlar

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.820 
different project they might have Kevlar
felt<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.160> eBay<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.700> don't<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:18.570> but

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
felt on eBay I don't know how but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.810 
felt on eBay I don't know how but
probably<00:02:19.830> other<00:02:19.980> stuff<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.340> work<00:02:20.520> blessed

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
probably other stuff would work blessed

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.500 
probably other stuff would work blessed
just<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> had<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.110> popped<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.510> tying

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
just what I had and popped it in tying

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.080 
just what I had and popped it in tying
it<00:02:24.630> up<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.890> enough<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.340> doesn't<00:02:26.640> move<00:02:26.760> but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
it up just enough so it doesn't move but

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.130 
it up just enough so it doesn't move but
obviously<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.570> want<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.840> tighten<00:02:28.050> it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
obviously you don't want to tighten it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.310 
obviously you don't want to tighten it
up<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.410> much<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.160> changes<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.690> bends

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
up so much that it changes the it bends

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960 
up so much that it changes the it bends
the<00:02:31.350> pivot<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.610> tapped<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.850> in

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the pivot and then just tapped it in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
the pivot and then just tapped it in
from<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.210> top<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.720> way<00:02:33.840> through<00:02:34.110> which

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
from the top all the way through which

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.410 
from the top all the way through which
is<00:02:34.890> surprisingly<00:02:35.550> easy<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:36.120> cuz<00:02:36.240> I'm

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
is surprisingly easy actually cuz I'm

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.400 
is surprisingly easy actually cuz I'm
this<00:02:36.540> stuff<00:02:36.750> do<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.020> it's<00:02:37.170> already

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
this stuff do you know it's already

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.310 
this stuff do you know it's already
lubricated<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:39.900> went<00:02:40.020> through<00:02:40.140> like

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
lubricated and it just went through like

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.660 
lubricated and it just went through like
a<00:02:40.350> dream<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.770> did<00:02:40.920> initially<00:02:41.660> use<00:02:42.660> stainless

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
a dream I did initially use stainless

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.250 
a dream I did initially use stainless
tube<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> trouble<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.690> had<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.990> was

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
tube but the trouble I had with that was

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
tube but the trouble I had with that was
the<00:02:46.440> inside<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.130> still<00:02:47.790> had<00:02:47.880> meal<00:02:48.090> scale<00:02:48.420> on

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the inside was still had meal scale on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870 
the inside was still had meal scale on
and<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.930> would<00:02:49.020> blunt<00:02:49.770> my<00:02:49.890> tap<00:02:50.190> really

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
and that would blunt my tap really

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.750 
and that would blunt my tap really
quickly<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.190> takes<00:02:53.370> more<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.640> more

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
quickly and then it takes more and more

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.500 
quickly and then it takes more and more
resistance<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:55.370> yeah<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.330> happy

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
resistance to yeah you know it's happy

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
resistance to yeah you know it's happy
way<00:02:57.690> through<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.320> would

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
way through in it and it would

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.590 
way through in it and it would
eventually<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.250> bulge<00:02:59.640> up<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> sides<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
eventually and bulge up the sides and it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.450 
eventually and bulge up the sides and it
just<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.170> terrible<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.190> wouldn't<00:03:02.400> work

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
just just terrible it just wouldn't work

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.060 
just just terrible it just wouldn't work
whereas<00:03:02.940> these<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.570> mean<00:03:03.690> he'll<00:03:03.780> come<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
whereas these and I mean he'll come the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.160 
whereas these and I mean he'll come the
tolerances<00:03:05.640> are<00:03:05.790> really<00:03:06.240> spot-on<00:03:06.630> really

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
tolerances are really spot-on really

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.190 
tolerances are really spot-on really
well-made<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.660> they're<00:03:09.840> designed

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
well-made and you know they're designed

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.310 
well-made and you know they're designed
for<00:03:10.320> this<00:03:10.440> sort<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.740> thing<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.660> could<00:03:13.110> try

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
for this sort of thing so you could try

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.580 
for this sort of thing so you could try
em<00:03:13.530> stainless<00:03:14.100> or<00:03:14.250> hardened<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:16.290> might<00:03:16.470> have

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
em stainless or hardened you might have

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260 
em stainless or hardened you might have
more<00:03:16.770> luck<00:03:16.800> on<00:03:17.070> me<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:17.460> I<00:03:17.490> found<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.120> these

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
more luck on me but I found that these

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.560 
more luck on me but I found that these
you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.630> I've<00:03:18.750> used<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.170> knife

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
you know I've used this knife

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.430 
you know I've used this knife
extensively<00:03:21.570> opened<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.110> closed<00:03:22.290> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
extensively opened and closed it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.950 
extensively opened and closed it
thousands<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.980> times<00:03:23.210> beating<00:03:24.210> on<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.510> it's

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
thousands of times beating on it it's

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.240 
thousands of times beating on it it's
got<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> patina<00:03:25.440> going<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.130> what

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
got a patina going on it's what

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.720 
got a patina going on it's what
scratches<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:28.380> I've<00:03:28.500> not<00:03:29.280> had<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
scratches on it and I've not had the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.010 
scratches on it and I've not had the
slightest<00:03:30.270> issue

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
slightest issue

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.760 
slightest issue
it<00:03:31.920> also<00:03:32.040> has<00:03:32.220> sort<00:03:32.490> of<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:33.000> quite<00:03:33.270> a

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
it also has sort of a that's quite a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.990 
it also has sort of a that's quite a
different<00:03:34.770> feel<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.460> know<00:03:35.580> hardened

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
different feel to you know hardened

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.410 
different feel to you know hardened
pivot<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.390> somewhat<00:03:36.660> small<00:03:37.070> liquid<00:03:38.360> sort<00:03:39.360> of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
pivot is somewhat small liquid sort of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.610 
pivot is somewhat small liquid sort of
feeling<00:03:39.660> it's<00:03:39.810> hard<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.050> describe<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:42.620> yeah

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
feeling it's hard to describe but yeah

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.280 
feeling it's hard to describe but yeah
very<00:03:44.010> nice

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
very nice
