00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.899
 this is a healthy chewing teeth 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.899
 surrounded by a healthy disk 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.460
 And this is how the teeth look from the inside. 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.419
 these are hard tooth tissues 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.969
 most of them gasoline 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.130
 it is a tooth cage 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.980
 in which to cover the top with a case of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.230
 solid germanium and bone-like 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 cement 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.609
 well, you and dentin have cavities 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.739
 in the bullet na nerves and vessels supplying the tooth 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.829
 which is beyond responsible 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.479
 the tip of the roots unites the tooth altogether 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.800
 by the body 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 if the tooth arose with 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.030
 then it starts with small defects on 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 Enamel surface which is enough 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.880
 moves quickly to under enamel 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.810
 and dentin 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.620
 it is then that itching begins to react 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.810
 warm cold or sweet 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.520
 for as long as korea snow the verse bullets were 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.940
 in the cavity formed most often 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.680
 can be put a seal or it will be 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 covered with a crown 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.920
 if you do not promptly consult a doctor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.790
 then caries will develop further and 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 will reach the tooth console when I'm in this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.320
 sensitive tissue inflammation will begin 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.430
 due to the development of inflammation and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.050
 lack of blood supply 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.480
 pulp will die most often it 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.680
 accompanied by severe pain 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.730
 in this case, treatment is already necessary 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.100
 tooth root 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.270
 gender and ships hiding more than once 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.200
 should almost always be removed 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.750
 and the tooth canal is processed 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 mechanical and drug 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.789
 then the channel is planned 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:44.809
 for example special 

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:47.809
 or gutta-percha 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.400
 sound saved 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 timely treatment of the canal of the tooth 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.860
 can prevent occurrence on its 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
 granuloma roots or even cysts 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.550
 so is the treatment of the sick tooth 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.050
 let's follow the example of the front tooth that 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.489
 happens next 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.079
 consider an example using 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.350
 modern technology Stirlitz 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.720
 with mineral fibers 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 special plates combined together 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.920
 pitch using this winter technology 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.109
 are installed in the root canal 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.430
 based on this pin using 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.409
 composites form culture 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.469
 teeth and preserved 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.869
 natural tooth tissue can also 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.159
 to be used 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.309
 so formed stumps 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.440
 being processed 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.380
 as required to perform new 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.380
 short 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.389
 m 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.059
 if these words were not treated 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.309
 channels 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.389
 it is hardly possible to do nothing 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.379
 miss as for example can 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.909
 the more work with the application 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.909
 modern technology 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.879
 with individually cast from 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.519
 noble metal root tabs 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.730
 even clubs 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.509
 whose channels have been treated much earlier 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.509
 can be successfully restored 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.049
 another good decision is based 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.589
 on the application of industrial 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.039
 making titanium pins 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.039
 they are screwed into the root canal 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.819
 titanium derricks or questionnaires 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.759
 also supports tooth cultures 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.159
 formed to do
