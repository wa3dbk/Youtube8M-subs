00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the device so but at that time I already

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020 
the device so but at that time I already
was<00:01:18.560> very<00:01:19.560> heavily<00:01:19.890> involved<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.460> deciding<00:01:20.939> my

own turntables and as my background is
scientist<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.770> working<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
scientist I was working at the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
scientist I was working at the
University<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> Freiburg<00:01:27.119> during<00:01:27.810> our

research for the industry in material
science<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.490> bit<00:01:32.610> familiar<00:01:32.759> in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
science I'm a little bit familiar in

science I'm a little bit familiar in
deal

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
deal

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.320 
deal
with<00:01:34.170> different<00:01:34.470> structures<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.400> material

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
with different structures and material

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.470 
with different structures and material
properties<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.410> I<00:01:37.440> have<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:37.980> idea<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
properties so I have my idea of how to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.670 
properties so I have my idea of how to
design<00:01:39.870> a<00:01:39.930> turntable

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
design a turntable

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
design a turntable
that's<00:01:41.250> nice<00:01:41.820> looking<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.720> point<00:01:43.020> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that's nice looking at the one point but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
that's nice looking at the one point but
also<00:01:43.650> perfectly<00:01:44.430> working<00:01:44.910> from<00:01:45.090> the

also perfectly working from the
engineering<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> view<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.650> as<00:01:47.220> I'm

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
engineering point of view and as I'm

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.090 
engineering point of view and as I'm
singing<00:01:47.760> to<00:01:47.850> different<00:01:48.270> choirs<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:49.100> baritone

singing to different choirs I'm baritone
and<00:01:50.370> tenor<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:52.200> am<00:01:52.830> for<00:01:53.040> special<00:01:53.460> feeling<00:01:53.790> for

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and tenor I am for special feeling for

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.460 
and tenor I am for special feeling for
music<00:01:54.420> in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
music in

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.039

I<00:01:56.500> have<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.430> startled<00:01:57.939> approach<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.659> my<00:01:58.869> own

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
I have a startled approach and my own

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.840 
I have a startled approach and my own
thoughts<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.680> how<00:01:59.890> music<00:02:00.310> should<00:02:00.460> sound<00:02:00.670> like

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
thoughts of how music should sound like

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.139 
thoughts of how music should sound like
and<00:02:01.689> what<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.079> believe<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:03.130> very<00:02:03.909> nice

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
and what I believe in is very nice

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.990 
and what I believe in is very nice
background<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.560> very<00:02:05.829> nice<00:02:06.070> moments<00:02:06.579> temper

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
background and very nice moments temper

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.210 
background and very nice moments temper
and<00:02:07.180> dynamics<00:02:07.840> also<00:02:08.110> micro<00:02:08.619> dynamics<00:02:09.069> not

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
and dynamics also micro dynamics not

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.830 
and dynamics also micro dynamics not
only<00:02:09.580> rough<00:02:09.880> dynamics<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.420> most

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
only rough dynamics that most

easily<00:02:15.120> well<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:17.260> what's<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> secret

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
easily well what what's the secret

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000 
easily well what what's the secret
behind<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.610> design<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.290> made<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
behind the design is that I made a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.820 
behind the design is that I made a
special<00:02:21.790> combination<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.720> different<00:02:23.319> density

special combination of different density

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.370 
special combination of different density
and<00:02:24.069> weights<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.550> materials<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.170> are

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
and weights of materials so we are

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.840 
and weights of materials so we are
looking<00:02:27.099> here<00:02:27.670> at<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.269> kernel<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:30.519> design

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.629 
figures on your turntable and you can
also<00:04:20.350> adjust<00:04:21.310> azimuth<00:04:22.210> perfectly<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.639> this

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
also adjust azimuth perfectly so this

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.850 
also adjust azimuth perfectly so this
was<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.120> second<00:04:25.510> product<00:04:25.690> that<00:04:26.020> we<00:04:26.200> invented

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
was a second product that we invented

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.030 
was a second product that we invented
for<00:04:27.150> setting<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.240> two<00:04:28.389> things<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.860> motor

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
for setting up two things the motor

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.740 
for setting up two things the motor
decide<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.580> come<00:04:30.760> back<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.090> this<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:31.450> is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
decide to come back to this one is

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.870 
decide to come back to this one is
controlled<00:04:32.380> by<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.590> microprocessor<00:04:32.979> circuitry

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
controlled by a microprocessor circuitry

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.390 
controlled by a microprocessor circuitry
which<00:04:34.479> is<00:04:34.630> making<00:04:34.990> use<00:04:35.139> of<00:04:35.169> an<00:04:35.470> ultra<00:04:35.830> low

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
which is making use of an ultra low

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.659 
which is making use of an ultra low
jitter<00:04:37.080> high<00:04:38.080> frequency<00:04:38.620> or<00:04:38.770> sentorria<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
jitter high frequency or sentorria and

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.110 
jitter high frequency or sentorria and
running<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.180> software<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:42.220> by<00:04:42.789> now<00:04:43.060> the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
running on software so it's by now the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.870 
running on software so it's by now the
reference<00:04:43.690> design<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.260> pops<00:04:44.500> they<00:04:45.400> have<00:04:45.640> one

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
reference design for pops they have one

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.450 
reference design for pops they have one
in<00:04:46.090> their<00:04:46.419> laboratory<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.260> even<00:04:47.950> measure<00:04:48.130> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
in their laboratory to even measure the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.409 
in their laboratory to even measure the
accuracy<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.120> motors<00:04:50.070> okay<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.240> thank<00:04:52.240> you

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
accuracy of the motors okay so thank you

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.550 
accuracy of the motors okay so thank you
very<00:04:52.600> much<00:04:52.870> for<00:04:53.350> your<00:04:54.280> bike
