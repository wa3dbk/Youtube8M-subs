00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
introduced me to the offense but now I'm

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.289 
introduced me to the offense but now I'm
playing<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.440> lot<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.920> lot<00:03:19.430> faster<00:03:19.970> because<00:03:20.150> I

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
playing a lot a lot faster because I

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.000 
playing a lot a lot faster because I
know<00:03:20.450> what<00:03:20.930> I'm<00:03:21.019> doing<00:03:21.380> like<00:03:21.530> when<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.709> line<00:03:21.980> up

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.120 
know what I'm doing like when I line up
I<00:03:22.310> know<00:03:22.400> what<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.700> got<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.239> see<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.600> mic<00:03:23.840> ID<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.620> I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
I know what I got I see the mic ID and I

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.250 
I know what I got I see the mic ID and I
understand<00:03:25.730> what's<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.420> now<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.019> i

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
understand what's going on now so i

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.110 
understand what's going on now so i
think<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.860> boosts<00:03:28.250> my<00:03:28.370> confidence<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.970> lot

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
think that boosts my confidence a lot

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.460 
think that boosts my confidence a lot
now<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.360> i<00:03:29.570> know<00:03:29.600> what<00:03:29.900> i<00:03:29.930> actually<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.350> to

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
now that i know what i actually have to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.220 
now that i know what i actually have to
do<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.799> I'm<00:03:30.860> not<00:03:31.010> guessing<00:03:31.250> sometimes

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
do and I'm not guessing sometimes

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.479 
do and I'm not guessing sometimes
blocking<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.380> big<00:03:33.590> part<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.070> tight<00:03:34.310> end

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
blocking is a big part of the tight end

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.460 
blocking is a big part of the tight end
because<00:03:34.850> like<00:03:35.030> we're<00:03:35.269> next<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.140> offensive

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
because like we're next to the offensive

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.830 
because like we're next to the offensive
lineman<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.250> we're<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.150> trenches<00:03:38.360> all<00:03:38.690> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
lineman so we're in the trenches all the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.699 
lineman so we're in the trenches all the
time<00:03:39.049> as<00:03:39.290> well<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:40.540> route-running<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.840> i<00:03:42.170> mean

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
time as well and route-running is i mean

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.990 
time as well and route-running is i mean
that's<00:03:42.890> that's<00:03:43.100> something<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.640> I've<00:03:43.940> been

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
that's that's something that I've been

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.750 
that's that's something that I've been
able<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.660> do<00:03:44.870> since<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.470> was<00:03:45.709> since<00:03:46.579> I've

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
able to do since I was since I've

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.310 
able to do since I was since I've
started<00:03:46.940> playing<00:03:47.390> tight<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:47.959> that's<00:03:48.110> just

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
started playing tight in so that's just

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280 
started playing tight in so that's just
second<00:03:49.130> nature<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.400> me<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:50.019> blocking<00:03:51.019> is

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
second nature to me but blocking is

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.259 
second nature to me but blocking is
something<00:03:51.620> I've<00:03:51.739> actually<00:03:51.890> had<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.310> work<00:03:53.060> on

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
something I've actually had to work on

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.509 
something I've actually had to work on
and<00:03:53.600> spend<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.019> time<00:03:54.320> with<00:03:54.530> outside<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.220> with

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
and spend some time with outside of with

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.520 
and spend some time with outside of with
my<00:03:55.670> coaches<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.390> by<00:03:56.570> myself<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:57.230> get<00:03:57.380> better

time we going to our second to a day the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.660 
time we going to our second to a day the
first<00:04:37.030> one<00:04:37.210> wasn't<00:04:37.390> that<00:04:37.630> bad<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:38.550> think<00:04:39.550> we're

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
first one wasn't that bad I think we're

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.070 
first one wasn't that bad I think we're
just<00:04:39.700> going<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.000> move<00:04:40.180> forward<00:04:40.450> with<00:04:40.750> the
