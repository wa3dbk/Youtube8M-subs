 tutorial that they have been asking me 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 quite a lot these days and that is how you 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.679
 I made to have a custom name 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.259
 in the game and the software online or already 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.090
 be like normal player profile because 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.949
 have seen some have seen my videos 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.650
 that appears as 00 h 15 so let's 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.980
 begin I will teach you how to do that 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.640
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.500

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 description of the video we give right click 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.130
 extract here will leave you a folder like 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.850
 but for the moment ignore it 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.030
 we will ignore we are going to team 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 local disk ce 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 program files 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.090
 and we look for our folder gears of war 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 then we go to war game 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:28.359
 cook the ps and here in this folder 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.359

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:43.490
 name a like subsystem live but that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 we do not have to look for the file online 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.329
 subsist in pc point and then we are 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.099

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.179
 this folder and we paste the paste 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.649
 you will need to provide permits 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.280
 administrator to move this file 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.280
 continue

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.000
 username the profile name 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.220

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.420
 other cases that was another video in 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.000
 what you have seen will be player 1 so 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.660
 we only click here and when 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.660

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.050
 address we go to the first letter and 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.090
 and we choose the name we want 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.489
 remember to use only seven letters 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.459
 seven letters you always have to 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.269
 respect in the numbers of letters that 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.160
 It takes one player carries seven letters like that 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.799

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.360
 seven letters in my case I will put but 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.690
 we do not have to erase any letter 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.660
 we only click on it to the letter 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.990
 we want and automatically 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.650

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.949
 then hx later it was 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.130
 if in case you do not have everything left 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.000

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.450

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.530
 to fail and save 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.100
 since it is saved we closed this 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.410
