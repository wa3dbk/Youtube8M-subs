my<00:00:30.349> tractor<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.130> I<00:00:31.189> realized<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:31.910> have<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.150> find

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
my tractor and I realized I have to find

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.530 
my tractor and I realized I have to find
a<00:00:32.930> way<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.230> get<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.650> valve<00:00:33.860> stems<00:00:34.280> off<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.880> I

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
a way to get the valve stems off and I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.250 
a way to get the valve stems off and I
don't<00:00:35.780> have<00:00:35.990> a<00:00:36.020> valve<00:00:36.380> stem<00:00:37.340> tool<00:00:37.880> so<00:00:38.870> what<00:00:39.230> I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
don't have a valve stem tool so what I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.470 
don't have a valve stem tool so what I
did<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.640> took<00:00:41.260> this<00:00:42.260> stock<00:00:43.190> with<00:00:43.910> a<00:00:43.940> grinder

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
did is I took this stock with a grinder

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.800 
did is I took this stock with a grinder
and<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.100> ground<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.120> can<00:00:47.330> see<00:00:47.540> that

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
and I just ground if you can see that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.270 
and I just ground if you can see that
it's<00:00:48.350> kind<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:48.530> hard<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.740> hold<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.040> steady

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
it's kind of hard to hold it steady

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.480 
it's kind of hard to hold it steady
upside<00:00:49.730> down<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.380> that<00:00:51.380> is<00:00:51.530> ground<00:00:51.890> with<00:00:52.460> a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
upside down here that is ground with a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.000 
upside down here that is ground with a
standard<00:00:53.000> four<00:00:53.360> inch<00:00:53.540> grinding<00:00:54.110> metal<00:00:54.500> cutoff

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
standard four inch grinding metal cutoff

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.060 
standard four inch grinding metal cutoff
wheel<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.580> little<00:00:56.030> notch<00:00:56.540> in<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.350> and<00:01:00.040> made<00:01:01.040> a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
wheel a little notch in that and made a

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.229 
wheel a little notch in that and made a
tool<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.510> Ravel<00:01:03.260> stem<00:01:03.670> remover<00:01:04.670> tool<00:01:04.879> I'll

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
tool to Ravel stem remover tool I'll

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.160 
tool to Ravel stem remover tool I'll
show<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.479> how<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.659> works<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:08.020> here's<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.140> I

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
show you how it works so here's what I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.350 
show you how it works so here's what I
did<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:10.160> I<00:01:10.310> said<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.550> just<00:01:10.580> put<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> little<00:01:11.150> notch

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
did as I said I just put a little notch

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.170 
did as I said I just put a little notch
on<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.780> end<00:01:12.280> it's<00:01:13.280> going<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.550> be<00:01:13.610> very<00:01:13.730> hard<00:01:14.030> to

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
on the end it's going to be very hard to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.690 
on the end it's going to be very hard to
see<00:01:15.010> but<00:01:16.010> I<00:01:16.100> put<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.370> little<00:01:16.750> notch<00:01:18.280> just<00:01:19.280> ground

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
see but I put a little notch just ground

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.820 
see but I put a little notch just ground
a<00:01:19.909> notch<00:01:20.120> right<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:20.659> Megan's<00:01:21.230> pick<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.770> up

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
a notch right there Megan's pick that up

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.010 
a notch right there Megan's pick that up
and<00:01:24.490> then<00:01:25.490> what<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:25.610> did<00:01:25.730> is<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:26.090> bought<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.720> bunch
