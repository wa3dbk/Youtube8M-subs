and a tip I like to put a little marker

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
and a tip I like to put a little marker
on<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.909> bottom<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.110> easy<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
on the bottom that way it's easy and I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
on the bottom that way it's easy and I
know<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> line<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:22.110> way

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
know what it's going to line up this way

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
know what it's going to line up this way
I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.710> line<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> point<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> bottom<00:01:24.060> two

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
I can line the point at the bottom two

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
I can line the point at the bottom two
right<00:01:24.510> there<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.560> top<00:01:25.740> always

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
right there and then the top always

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.170 
right there and then the top always
stays<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> seven<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:28.640> just<00:01:29.640> happen<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:29.970> pick

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
stays at the seven I just happen to pick

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.469 
stays at the seven I just happen to pick
seven<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:30.960> no<00:01:31.110> reason<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.330> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
seven there's no reason you can use it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
seven there's no reason you can use it
on<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.170> boards<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
on any one of these boards you're just

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.429 
on any one of these boards you're just
going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> line<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> top

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
going to want to put a line from the top

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.950 
going to want to put a line from the top
of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> point<00:01:38.250> down<00:01:38.790> through<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> center<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of the point down through the center of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.950 
of the point down through the center of
the<00:01:40.200> star<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> we're<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> on

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the star so we're going to do that on

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.999 
the star so we're going to do that on
all<00:01:43.200> five<00:01:44.040> points<00:01:45.590> now<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:46.799> using

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
all five points now if you're using

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
all five points now if you're using
pattern<00:01:47.430> paper<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.090> did<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
pattern paper which I did for the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
pattern paper which I did for the
project<00:01:49.259> you'll<00:01:49.920> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> make<00:01:50.280> sure<00:01:50.509> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
project you'll want to make sure that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870 
project you'll want to make sure that
the<00:01:52.020> paper<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.710> face<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> at

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the paper that you want face up is at

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.789 
the paper that you want face up is at
the<00:01:54.060> bottom<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> end<00:01:55.680> up

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the bottom because when you end up

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
the bottom because when you end up
folding<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.689> gets

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
folding this that's the side that gets

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319 
folding this that's the side that gets
on<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> top<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
on the top so now you can see that I

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
on the top so now you can see that I
have<00:02:00.390> scored<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.530> five<00:02:02.130> minds<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.759> we're

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
have scored all five minds and we're

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:17.150 
have scored all five minds and we're
just<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> fold<00:02:04.619> each<00:02:05.430> point

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.920
