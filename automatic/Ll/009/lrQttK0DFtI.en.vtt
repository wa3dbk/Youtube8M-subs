00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
through my stamping stuff and came

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
through my stamping stuff and came
across<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:36.030> Sally<00:00:36.600> Hansen<00:00:37.110> insta<00:00:37.590> dries<00:00:37.829> now

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the UK where I live and I think the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.459 
the UK where I live and I think the
yellow<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.710> 65<00:00:47.579> peel<00:00:48.030> something

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
or beauty UK places like that and I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
or beauty UK places like that and I
thought<00:00:56.039> I'd<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.000> test<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
thought I'd have a test out with the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
thought I'd have a test out with the
water<00:00:58.320> marbling<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.940> wanted<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> see

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
water marbling so if you wanted to see

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
water marbling so if you wanted to see
the<00:01:00.989> results<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:03.149> stay<00:01:03.390> tuned

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
so I used three creams and three

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.050 
so I used three creams and three
metallics<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.370> 260<00:01:11.370> sonic<00:01:11.790> bloom

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
metallics so this is 260 sonic bloom

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
three cream shades and as you can see as

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.090 
three cream shades and as you can see as
I'm<00:02:00.840> building<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.260> my<00:02:01.410> bull's<00:02:01.650> eye<00:02:01.860> they

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I'm building up my bull's eye they

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.000 
I'm building up my bull's eye they
spread<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.480> well<00:02:03.660> now<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.620> water

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
spread really really well now this water

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.910 
spread really really well now this water
is<00:02:05.460> cold<00:02:06.330> water<00:02:06.570> from<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.020> tap<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:07.650> left

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is cold water from the tap and I've left

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
is cold water from the tap and I've left
it<00:02:08.100> for<00:02:08.250> about<00:02:08.310> an<00:02:08.640> hour<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.119> hours<00:02:09.660> just

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it for about an hour to two hours just

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
it for about an hour to two hours just
to<00:02:10.020> come<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.530> room<00:02:10.770> temperature<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.880> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to come up to room temperature it's a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.930 
to come up to room temperature it's a
nothing<00:02:12.180> special<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.520> recommend

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
nothing special and I would recommend

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.180 
nothing special and I would recommend
keeping<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.600> quite<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> small<00:02:16.410> container<00:02:16.950> as

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
keeping it in quite a small container as

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.870 
keeping it in quite a small container as
well<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.410> making<00:02:19.800> up<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.310> design

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
well so here on this making up a design

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.220 
well so here on this making up a design
I<00:02:21.209> would<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.540> was<00:02:21.630> trying<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.020> do<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
I would think I was trying to do a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.440 
I would think I was trying to do a
starburst<00:02:22.920> design<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.239> how<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
starburst design so this is how you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.810 
starburst design so this is how you

sure<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.239> they<00:02:33.750> were<00:02:33.780> actually<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> turn

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
sure if they were actually going to turn

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.460

so here I just use the pink and the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.480 
so here I just use the pink and the
yellow<00:03:12.150> again<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.290> comes<00:03:13.500> across<00:03:13.740> red<00:03:14.220> for

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
yellow again it comes across red for

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.200 
yellow again it comes across red for
some<00:03:14.640> reason<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.480> bright<00:03:15.720> pink<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:17.210> I
