00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.590 
adults and if you look at the feet of
different<00:00:54.859> ages<00:00:55.789> you<00:00:55.969> notice<00:00:56.299> that<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
different ages you notice that the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.049 
different ages you notice that the
infinite<00:00:56.929> nearly<00:00:57.440> all<00:00:57.620> have<00:00:57.859> flat<00:00:58.459> feet<00:00:58.789> from

infinite nearly all have flat feet from

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.270 
infinite nearly all have flat feet from
their<00:00:59.239> footprint<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.929> the<00:01:00.440> arch<00:01:00.619> gradually

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
their footprint and the arch gradually

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.600 
their footprint and the arch gradually
develops<00:01:01.789> with<00:01:01.969> time<00:01:02.269> but<00:01:03.079> about<00:01:03.519> 20%<00:01:04.519> of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
develops with time but about 20% of

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.390 
develops with time but about 20% of
adults<00:01:04.760> don't<00:01:05.299> have<00:01:06.080> an<00:01:06.380> arch<00:01:06.590> as<00:01:06.800> well<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.220> if

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
adults don't have an arch as well and if

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.060 
adults don't have an arch as well and if
they<00:01:07.550> have<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:08.000> flexible<00:01:08.990> flat<00:01:09.200> feet<00:01:09.500> they<00:01:10.040> can

they have a flexible flat feet they can

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.460 
they have a flexible flat feet they can
be<00:01:10.370> strong<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.730> pain-free<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.870> they<00:01:12.260> don't

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
be strong and pain-free and they don't

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.860 
be strong and pain-free and they don't
cause<00:01:12.680> any<00:01:12.920> problems<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.700> those<00:01:14.390> who<00:01:14.630> usually

cause any problems and those who usually

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.960 
cause any problems and those who usually
don't<00:01:15.680> develop<00:01:16.160> an<00:01:16.280> art<00:01:16.460> tend<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.850> be

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
don't develop an art tend to be

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.740 
don't develop an art tend to be
loose-jointed

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
loose-jointed

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.780 
loose-jointed
and<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:18.620> you're<00:01:18.740> concerned<00:01:19.130> about<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.490> arch

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
and if you're concerned about the arch

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.610 
and if you're concerned about the arch
and<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.120> infant<00:01:20.480> you<00:01:20.870> can<00:01:21.020> see<00:01:21.230> that<00:01:21.470> they

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
and the infant you can see that they

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.860 
and the infant you can see that they
have<00:01:21.650> an<00:01:21.980> arch<00:01:22.160> by<00:01:22.510> unweighting<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.630> foot

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
have an arch by unweighting the foot

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.420 
have an arch by unweighting the foot
letting<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:24.320> dangle<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.070> an<00:01:25.220> arch

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
letting it dangle and you have an arch

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.420 
letting it dangle and you have an arch
or<00:01:25.850> if<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.300> child<00:01:26.510> stands<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.500> toe<00:01:27.860> stands

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
or if the child stands and toe stands

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.150 
or if the child stands and toe stands
then<00:01:28.940> they<00:01:29.090> develop<00:01:29.540> an<00:01:29.630> arch<00:01:29.950> when<00:01:30.950> that

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
then they develop an arch when that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.450 
then they develop an arch when that
happens<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.350> just<00:01:33.350> as<00:01:33.500> children<00:01:33.950> or<00:01:34.190> have

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
happens so just as children or have

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730 
happens so just as children or have
different<00:01:34.880> heights<00:01:35.170> they<00:01:36.170> also<00:01:36.380> have

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
different heights they also have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.920 
different heights they also have
different<00:01:37.190> heights<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.970> their<00:01:38.120> arch<00:01:38.360> as<00:01:38.660> well

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
different heights of their arch as well

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
different heights of their arch as well
so<00:01:39.770> summer<00:01:40.100> developed<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:41.240> summers<00:01:41.660> and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so summer developed in summers and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.380 
so summer developed in summers and
fairly<00:01:42.950> low<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.400> others<00:01:43.640> are<00:01:43.820> flat<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.090> these

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
fairly low and others are flat and these

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.120 
fairly low and others are flat and these
are<00:01:44.600> normal<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.140> like<00:01:45.230> variations<00:01:45.980> of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
are normal just like variations of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.520 
are normal just like variations of
height<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.990> also<00:01:47.990> did<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.320> know<00:01:48.500> that

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
height and also did you know that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.010 
height and also did you know that
putting<00:01:49.010> various<00:01:49.909> pads<00:01:50.240> under<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> shoes

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
putting various pads under the shoes

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.500 
putting various pads under the shoes
really<00:01:51.290> just<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.830> waste<00:01:51.980> of<00:01:52.190> money<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.700> we're

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
really just a waste of money and we're

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.440 
really just a waste of money and we're
concerned<00:01:53.960> about<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.190> flat<00:01:55.760> foot<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.270> it's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
concerned about the flat foot if it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.630 
concerned about the flat foot if it's
stiff<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.990> it's<00:01:57.170> particularly<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.710> problem<00:01:57.800> or

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
stiff and it's particularly a problem or

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.120 
stiff and it's particularly a problem or

four to six or so they become little
knock-kneed<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.560> then

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
what's best for the kid well we do know

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.270 
what's best for the kid well we do know
that<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.660> barefooted<00:04:52.200> people<00:04:52.680> have<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.010> best

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
that the barefooted people have the best

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.170 
that the barefooted people have the best
feet<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.960> shoes<00:04:55.410> should<00:04:55.800> simulate<00:04:56.520> going

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
feet and so shoes should simulate going

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.540 
feet and so shoes should simulate going
barefooted<00:04:57.780> as<00:04:57.900> much<00:04:58.140> as<00:04:58.320> possible<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.040> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
barefooted as much as possible so the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.010 
barefooted as much as possible so the
first<00:04:59.790> thing<00:05:00.030> they<00:05:00.180> should<00:05:00.420> be<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.690> large

first thing they should be is large

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.400 
first thing they should be is large
enough<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.980> as<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.250> not<00:05:02.430> cramp<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.030> foot<00:05:03.410> they

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
enough so as to not cramp the foot they

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.400 
enough so as to not cramp the foot they
should<00:05:04.680> also<00:05:04.860> be<00:05:05.040> flexible<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.990> foot<00:05:07.200> can

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
should also be flexible so the foot can

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.710 
should also be flexible so the foot can
move<00:05:07.590> normally<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.700> muscle<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.300> develop

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
move normally and the muscle can develop

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.490 
move normally and the muscle can develop
in<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.320> normal<00:05:10.740> fashion<00:05:11.240> also<00:05:12.500> material

especially in hot climates should be

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.990 
especially in hot climates should be
breathable<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:17.010> it<00:05:17.160> doesn't<00:05:17.520> really<00:05:17.669> cause

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
breathable so it doesn't really cause
