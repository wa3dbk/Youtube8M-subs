00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
think it's healthy for me are there any

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.919 
think it's healthy for me are there any
healthy<00:00:07.799> cheese's<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.280> there

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
healthy cheese's out there

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.180 
healthy cheese's out there
that's<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.080> great<00:00:10.290> question<00:00:10.530> yes<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.040> are

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
that's a great question yes there are

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
that's a great question yes there are
healthy<00:00:11.550> cheese's<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.210> if<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.019> think<00:00:13.259> about

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
healthy cheese's and if you think about

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.039 
healthy cheese's and if you think about
it<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.070> country<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.700> eat<00:00:14.940> 30<00:00:15.420> pounds<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it in this country we eat 30 pounds of

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.680 
it in this country we eat 30 pounds of
cheese<00:00:16.289> per<00:00:16.619> person<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.250> each<00:00:17.940> pound<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
cheese per person and each pound of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.720 
cheese per person and each pound of
cheese<00:00:18.930> requires<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> gallon<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> milk

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
cheese requires about a gallon of milk

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
cheese requires about a gallon of milk
so<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.449> think<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.869> what's<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.170> milk

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so if you think about what's in milk

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.570 
so if you think about what's in milk
then<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.800> figure<00:00:23.039> out<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
then you can figure out what is a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.670 
then you can figure out what is a
healthy<00:00:24.000> cheese<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.510> milk<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.170> protein

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
healthy cheese in milk we have protein

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.460 
healthy cheese in milk we have protein
two<00:00:25.980> types<00:00:26.279> casein<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> whey<00:00:27.240> protein<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
two types casein and whey protein and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160 
two types casein and whey protein and
then<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> saturated<00:00:29.820> fats<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.570> then

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
then we have the saturated fats and then

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
then we have the saturated fats and then
we<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.470> sugar<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.099> lactose<00:00:32.730> cheese's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
we have sugar which is lactose cheese's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.660 
we have sugar which is lactose cheese's
help<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.200> for<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.620> variation<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.399> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
help some for more variation of all that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
help some for more variation of all that
the<00:00:35.880> healthiest<00:00:36.360> cheeses<00:00:36.809> are<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> most

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the healthiest cheeses are the most

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
the healthiest cheeses are the most
simple<00:00:38.070> cheese's<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.700> made<00:00:38.879> cottage

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
simple cheese's that are made cottage

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
simple cheese's that are made cottage
cheese<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.710> healthiest<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
cheese is probably the healthiest for a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
cheese is probably the healthiest for a
lot<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> reasons<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.540> simple<00:00:42.989> milk<00:00:43.230> that's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
lot of reasons but a simple milk that's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.139 
lot of reasons but a simple milk that's
allowed<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> curd<00:00:44.219> by<00:00:44.460> adding<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:44.940> type<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
allowed to curd by adding some type of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
allowed to curd by adding some type of
like<00:00:45.960> vinegar<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.739> other<00:00:46.890> type<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> or

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like vinegar or some other type of or

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
like vinegar or some other type of or
lemon<00:00:47.789> juice<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:49.050> turns<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> curd

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
lemon juice and it turns into the curd

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.450 
lemon juice and it turns into the curd
which<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.820> casing<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> way<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.620> left

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
which is the casing the way is left

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
which is the casing the way is left
aside<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.360> cottage<00:00:54.780> cheese<00:00:55.050> especially

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
aside but and cottage cheese especially

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
aside but and cottage cheese especially
if<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.219> made<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.610> low-fat<00:00:57.149> dairy<00:00:57.780> products

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
if it's made from low-fat dairy products

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
if it's made from low-fat dairy products
is<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:58.800> high<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> protein<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.570> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
is very high in protein and it's very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.039 
is very high in protein and it's very
low<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.079> saturated<00:01:01.410> fat<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:03.329> does<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
low in saturated fat and it does have a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.840 
low in saturated fat and it does have a
lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> salt<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:05.100> cheeses<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> got

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
lot of salt like all cheeses so you got

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
lot of salt like all cheeses so you got
to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> careful<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> salt<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.260> look<00:01:07.439> for

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to be careful of the salt so look for

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
to be careful of the salt so look for
low-fat<00:01:07.950> cottage<00:01:08.189> cheese<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> healthiest

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
low-fat cottage cheese as a healthiest

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
low-fat cottage cheese as a healthiest
mozzarella<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.830> consumed<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
mozzarella which is a really consumed a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
mozzarella which is a really consumed a
lot<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.760> country<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:13.110> similar<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
lot in this country it's very similar to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
lot in this country it's very similar to
cottage<00:01:14.400> cheese<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> curd<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> needed

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cottage cheese in but the curd is needed

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
cottage cheese in but the curd is needed
later<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.939> soft

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
later on but if you look for a soft

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.230 
later on but if you look for a soft
mozzarella<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.189> liquid<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.820> has<00:01:20.850> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
mozzarella with a more liquid it has in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
mozzarella with a more liquid it has in
it<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.600> moisture<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> has<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it the more moisture it has in it the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
it the more moisture it has in it the
less<00:01:22.979> fattening<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> watch<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.330> salt

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
less fattening it is watch the salt

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.469 
less fattening it is watch the salt
content<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.740> high<00:01:25.920> high<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.450> protein

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
content but it's high high in protein

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
content but it's high high in protein
now<00:01:27.930> recoat<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> little<00:01:28.860> different<00:01:29.189> instead

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
now recoat is a little different instead

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
now recoat is a little different instead
of<00:01:29.520> being<00:01:29.700> made<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.119> casein<00:01:30.630> protein<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.350> all

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
of being made of casein protein like all

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.080 
of being made of casein protein like all
these<00:01:31.650> other<00:01:31.710> cheeses<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.490> made<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> way

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
these other cheeses it's made of the way

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.560 
these other cheeses it's made of the way
the<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.680> milky<00:01:34.680> looking<00:01:35.570> transparent

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the kind of milky looking transparent

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
the kind of milky looking transparent
stuff<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> you've<00:01:37.259> seen<00:01:37.409> leftover<00:01:38.070> in

stuff that you've seen leftover in
cottage<00:01:38.520> cheese<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
cottage cheese and that's what is in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.740 
cottage cheese and that's what is in
ricotta<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> has<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.369> less<00:01:41.750> whey

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ricotta so it has a little less whey

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
ricotta so it has a little less whey
protein<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.189> less<00:01:44.310> protein

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
protein there's a little less protein

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.539 
protein there's a little less protein
content<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.240> ricotta<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.979> healthy

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
content in ricotta but it's very healthy

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.749 
content in ricotta but it's very healthy
for<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.840> low<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.649> saturated<00:01:50.430> fats

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
for you it's low in the saturated fats

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.440 
for you it's low in the saturated fats
it<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.390> high<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> salt<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:53.119> cheese<00:01:54.119> ages

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it can be high in salt as cheese ages

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
it can be high in salt as cheese ages
here<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.380> cheddar<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.950> second<00:01:56.310> most

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
here we have cheddar the second most

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
here we have cheddar the second most
common<00:01:56.790> consumed<00:01:57.149> cheese<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> country

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
common consumed cheese in the country

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
common consumed cheese in the country
when<00:01:58.680> cheese<00:01:59.009> ages<00:01:59.399> what<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.600> good<00:02:00.750> thing

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
when cheese ages what the good thing

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
when cheese ages what the good thing
happens<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.619> lose<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.759> lactose

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
happens is that you lose the the lactose

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.569 
happens is that you lose the the lactose
the<00:02:03.420> lactose<00:02:03.840> sugar<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.469> converted<00:02:05.399> into

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the lactose sugar is converted into

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.219 
the lactose sugar is converted into
lactic<00:02:06.000> acid<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.600> people<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.020> lactose

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
lactic acid so people are lactose

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
lactic acid so people are lactose
intolerant<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.819> aged<00:02:09.090> cheese's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
intolerant can have the aged cheese's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.930 
intolerant can have the aged cheese's
but<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.349> saturated<00:02:10.830> fats<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.459> more

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
but the saturated fats get more

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
but the saturated fats get more
concentrated<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
concentrated so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.350 
concentrated so
the<00:02:13.709> cheese<00:02:13.950> ages<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.120> becomes

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the cheese ages like this it becomes

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.259 
the cheese ages like this it becomes
more<00:02:15.659> dense<00:02:15.989> there's<00:02:16.739> more<00:02:17.129> saturated<00:02:17.849> fat

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
more dense there's more saturated fat

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.270 
more dense there's more saturated fat
and<00:02:18.510> calories<00:02:19.049> per<00:02:19.260> ounce<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.680> be<00:02:19.799> careful<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and calories per ounce so be careful of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.039 
and calories per ounce so be careful of
that<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.030> variations<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.900> that

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
that you can have variations of that

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.190 
that you can have variations of that
like<00:02:22.260> sheep<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:23.269> goat<00:02:24.269> milk<00:02:24.299> cheeses<00:02:24.930> are

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
like sheep and goat milk cheeses are

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
like sheep and goat milk cheeses are
very<00:02:25.349> healthy<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.950> maybe<00:02:26.220> sometimes

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
very healthy for you maybe sometimes

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.430 
very healthy for you maybe sometimes
even<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.480> more<00:02:27.629> healthy<00:02:28.049> than<00:02:28.200> cow<00:02:28.409> milk

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
even a little more healthy than cow milk

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.600 
even a little more healthy than cow milk
fed<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.580> common<00:02:30.739> variety<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:32.159> combination

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
fed is a common variety of a combination

sheep<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.180> goat<00:02:33.360> cheese<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.750> very<00:02:33.959> healthy

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
sheep and goat cheese is very healthy

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.890 
sheep and goat cheese is very healthy
but<00:02:34.440> very<00:02:34.739> very<00:02:35.069> salty<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:36.329> worst<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.780> all

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
but very very salty the worst of all

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.899

cheeses<00:02:37.409> are<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.829> processed<00:02:38.280> cheeses<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909

come<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:40.190> container<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.489> or<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
come in a container like that or the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.360 
come in a container like that or the
sliced<00:02:42.810> cheeses<00:02:43.260> they're<00:02:43.440> really<00:02:43.739> processed

sliced cheeses they're really processed

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.400 
sliced cheeses they're really processed
to<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> lot<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.879> oils<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.840> additives<00:02:46.290> they

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
to have a lot of oils and additives they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.030 
to have a lot of oils and additives they
do<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.709> some<00:02:46.920> protein<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.910> they're<00:02:48.090> high<00:02:48.209> in

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
do have some protein but they're high in

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.009 
do have some protein but they're high in
salt<00:02:50.040> also<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> stick<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.720> moist

skim milk you can't go wrong you can

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.119 
skim milk you can't go wrong you can
actually<00:02:57.420> lose<00:02:57.780> weight<00:02:58.049> on<00:02:58.200> these<00:02:58.379> the

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
actually lose weight on these the

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.369 
actually lose weight on these the
calcium<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.209> these<00:03:00.329> low<00:03:00.540> fat<00:03:00.780> cheese's

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
calcium that's in these low fat cheese's

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.099 
calcium that's in these low fat cheese's
tends<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:02.190> help<00:03:02.819> reduce<00:03:03.239> weight<00:03:03.659> that's<00:03:03.870> been

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.920 
tends to help reduce weight that's been
shown<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.620> number<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> times<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.359> think<00:03:06.629> if

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930

you choose wisely you can have a healthy
