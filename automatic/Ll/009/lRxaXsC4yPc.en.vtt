today I am going to be showing you
probably<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> craziest<00:00:16.680> assault

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
probably one of the craziest assault

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
probably one of the craziest assault
rifles<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.910> ever<00:00:18.180> built<00:00:18.660> something<00:00:19.350> that

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
rifles I have ever built something that

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
rifles I have ever built something that
you<00:00:19.770> would<00:00:19.890> never<00:00:20.100> normally<00:00:20.670> see<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.199> combat

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
you would never normally see in combat

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.790 
you would never normally see in combat
but<00:00:22.890> instead<00:00:23.539> underwater<00:00:24.539> combat<00:00:25.230> sounds

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
but instead underwater combat sounds

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
but instead underwater combat sounds
crazy<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.539> Russians<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.230> made

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
crazy I know but the Russians have made

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.980 
crazy I know but the Russians have made
a<00:00:28.529> weapon<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.429> shoot<00:00:29.609> projectiles

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
a weapon that can shoot projectiles

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
a weapon that can shoot projectiles
underwater<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> high<00:00:31.949> velocity<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.850> like

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
underwater at a high velocity just like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.450 
underwater at a high velocity just like
real<00:00:33.300> guns<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> air<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
real guns in the air so here it is the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.959 
real guns in the air so here it is the
lego<00:00:35.700> aps<00:00:36.450> underwater<00:00:37.110> assault<00:00:37.590> rifle<00:00:40.969> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
lego aps underwater assault rifle so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
lego aps underwater assault rifle so
even<00:00:42.480> though<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.079> gun<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.500> interesting

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
even though that this gun is interesting

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.799 
even though that this gun is interesting
enough<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> background<00:00:45.390> behind

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
enough it has a lot of background behind

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.069 
enough it has a lot of background behind
it<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.590> actually<00:00:46.950> made<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.610> 1975<00:00:48.570> by

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it it was actually made back in 1975 by

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.709 
it it was actually made back in 1975 by
the<00:00:49.140> Soviet<00:00:49.770> Union<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.910> no<00:00:51.180> idea<00:00:51.480> what

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the Soviet Union I have no idea what

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.270 
the Soviet Union I have no idea what
they<00:00:51.840> were<00:00:51.899> thinking<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.620> try<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> make

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
they were thinking when they try to make

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
they were thinking when they try to make
this<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.180> all<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> apparently

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this but all I know is apparently

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.130 
this but all I know is apparently
fishing<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> Russia<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.570> lot<00:00:57.899> more

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
fishing in Russia is a lot more

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.470 
fishing in Russia is a lot more
different<00:00:58.590> than<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.969> apparently

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
different than it is here but apparently

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.260 
different than it is here but apparently
it<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:01.050> made<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.649> frogmen<00:01:02.309> back<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.820> naval

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
it was made for frogmen back when naval

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630 
it was made for frogmen back when naval
strikes<00:01:03.750> used<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> happen<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.710> during<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
strikes used to happen a lot during the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330 
strikes used to happen a lot during the
Cold<00:01:06.180> War<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.780> having<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.590> gun<00:01:07.860> proved<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Cold War and having this gun proved to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
Cold War and having this gun proved to
be<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.790> more<00:01:09.030> useful<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.720> using<00:01:10.170> any<00:01:10.350> kind

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
be a lot more useful than using any kind

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
be a lot more useful than using any kind
of<00:01:10.799> spear<00:01:11.159> gun<00:01:11.369> available<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> probably

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
of spear gun available so you probably

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
of spear gun available so you probably
are<00:01:13.140> looking<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> magazine<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.310> why<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
are looking at the magazine going why is

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
are looking at the magazine going why is
it<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> bullet

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
it like that that's because the bullet

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
it like that that's because the bullet
was<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.710> made<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.340> more

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
was actually made to be more

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.420 
was actually made to be more
hydrodynamic<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:19.920> flow

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
hydrodynamic so it can actually flow

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.710 
hydrodynamic so it can actually flow
through<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.850> water<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> high<00:01:21.509> velocity

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
through the water at a high velocity

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.710 
through the water at a high velocity
just<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.650> bullets<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> air<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
just like bullets do in the air so the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
just like bullets do in the air so the
stock<00:01:24.990> happens<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> wired<00:01:26.159> stock<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stock happens to be a wired stock and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
stock happens to be a wired stock and
when<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.210> folded<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.229> end<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> actually

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
when it's folded the end of it actually

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
when it's folded the end of it actually
folds<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> pistol<00:01:30.390> grip<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> guns

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
folds into the pistol grip of the guns

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.569 
folds into the pistol grip of the guns
so<00:01:31.290> technically<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:31.979> holding<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> stock

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
so technically you're holding the stock

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
so technically you're holding the stock
end<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.509> gun<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> same<00:01:34.350> time<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
end and the gun at the same time and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.520 
end and the gun at the same time and
just<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.520> overall<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.180> gun<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> reminds

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just the overall the gun kind of reminds

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
just the overall the gun kind of reminds
me<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> something<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.909> weird<00:01:39.210> sci-fi

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
me of something from like a weird sci-fi

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
me of something from like a weird sci-fi
movie<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.740> gun<00:01:40.950> doesn't<00:01:41.159> even<00:01:41.400> look

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
movie the gun doesn't even look

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.990 
movie the gun doesn't even look
realistic<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.600> yet<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.380> exists<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.610> bolt<00:01:44.850> on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
realistic but yet it exists the bolt on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
realistic but yet it exists the bolt on
the<00:01:45.149> gun<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.720> has<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> travel<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> fairly<00:01:47.009> long

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the gun also has to travel a fairly long

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.370 
the gun also has to travel a fairly long
distance<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> size<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
distance just because of the size of the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
distance just because of the size of the
magazine<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.009> how<00:01:50.159> small<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> bolt<00:01:50.909> actually

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
magazine and how small the bolt actually

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.960 
magazine and how small the bolt actually
really<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> weapon

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
really is on the weapon

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.460 
really is on the weapon
so<00:01:53.270> in<00:01:53.390> case<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.750> were<00:01:53.870> wondering<00:01:54.290> why<00:01:54.410> this

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
so in case you were wondering why this
