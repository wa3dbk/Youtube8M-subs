our rules like a dusty rose color and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
our rules like a dusty rose color and
then<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.790> putting<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.660> condition<00:00:34.140> run

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
then I'm putting on what condition run

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.030 
then I'm putting on what condition run
again<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.840> then<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.110> mix<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.620> until

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.100 
again and then just mix that up until
everything<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> combined

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.500 

and<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:48.280> are<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> two<00:00:48.700> colors<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.210> ended<00:00:49.420> up

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
and these are the two colors I ended up

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.479 
and these are the two colors I ended up
with<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.050> then<00:00:50.890> you're<00:00:51.010> ready<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.340> start

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
with and then you're ready to start

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.700 
with and then you're ready to start
dyeing<00:00:52.000> your<00:00:52.149> hair<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.930> I've<00:00:52.989> sectioned<00:00:53.290> the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
dyeing your hair so I've sectioned the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.590 
dyeing your hair so I've sectioned the
pink<00:00:53.949> side<00:00:54.190> away<00:00:54.340> while<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:54.790> start<00:00:55.149> on<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.300> blue

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
pink side away while I start on the blue

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.689 
pink side away while I start on the blue
side<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.140> basically<00:00:56.590> I'm<00:00:56.800> using<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.309> Tenten

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
side and basically I'm using the Tenten

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.369 
side and basically I'm using the Tenten
brush<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:58.329> get<00:00:58.570> right<00:00:58.750> under<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.170> roots

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
brush to just get right under the roots

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:17.260 
brush to just get right under the roots
so<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.220> more<00:01:00.430> precise

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.090 

and<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:17.930> once<00:01:18.140> I'm<00:01:18.320> done<00:01:18.470> with<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.680> roots<00:01:18.950> I

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and then once I'm done with the roots I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.859 
and then once I'm done with the roots I
just<00:01:19.340> use<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:19.549> hands<00:01:20.030> with<00:01:20.180> no<00:01:20.360> gloves<00:01:20.659> because

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
just use my hands with no gloves because

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.920 
just use my hands with no gloves because
it<00:01:21.080> doesn't<00:01:21.350> steam<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:21.799> much<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:23.360> just

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
it doesn't steam that much and I just

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.180 
it doesn't steam that much and I just
mush<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.619> all<00:01:24.740> into<00:01:25.100> my<00:01:25.130> hair<00:01:26.860> ensure<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
mush it all into my hair ensure that the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.820 
mush it all into my hair ensure that the
hair<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.400> completely<00:01:28.550> saturated<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.619> day

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
hair is completely saturated and the day

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.560 
hair is completely saturated and the day
this<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.460> why<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:31.820> wear<00:01:32.150> gloves<00:01:32.360> because

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
this is why I don't wear gloves because

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.060 
this is why I don't wear gloves because
you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.930> feel<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.259> better<00:01:33.440> without<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
you can feel it better without the

you can feel it better without the
gloves<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:39.710> once<00:01:39.860> you're<00:01:39.979> done<00:01:40.009> with
