00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
up it's a little darker and easier to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
up it's a little darker and easier to
see<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> highly<00:00:51.239> recommend<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
much of a difference on cloaking or

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.330 
much of a difference on cloaking or

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
go to controls and mouse sensitivity is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 
go to controls and mouse sensitivity is
pretty<00:01:03.359> important<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.680> settings<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.670> are

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
six of 11 on my windows control panel

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
six of 11 on my windows control panel
there's<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:11.040> 11<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.520> bars<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.939> you

and then I put this around fifty four

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
and then I put this around fifty four
percent<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> gives<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> nice<00:01:18.060> smooth

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
percent and that gives a nice smooth

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.080 
percent and that gives a nice smooth
mouse<00:01:19.470> cursor<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.310> me<00:01:22.100> next<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.030> you

show flyer helper I would I would set

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.870 
show flyer helper I would I would set
this<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> always<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:32.010> will<00:02:32.190> just<00:02:32.220> make<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.670> so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
you can see flying units you can

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
you can see flying units you can
actually<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:36.060> where<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.540> are<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
actually see where they are on the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
actually see where they are on the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
ground so if you need to target an AoE

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.710 
ground so if you need to target an AoE
like<00:02:39.959> an<00:02:40.140> EMP<00:02:40.800> or<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> psionic<00:02:41.520> storm<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.570> know

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
like an EMP or a psionic storm you know

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.830 
like an EMP or a psionic storm you know
where<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.319> cast<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.400> spell<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:45.209> order<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.600> hit

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
where to cast that spell in order to hit

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.320 
where to cast that spell in order to hit
in<00:02:46.020> order<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> hit<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> flying<00:02:47.280> units<00:02:47.670> because

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
in order to hit the flying units because

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.150 
in order to hit the flying units because
it<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.600> be<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> little<00:02:48.900> difficult<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.890> way<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it can be a little difficult the way the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.660 
it can be a little difficult the way the
cameras<00:02:50.489> set<00:02:50.670> up<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.480> on

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
cameras set up if you don't have that on

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.759 
cameras set up if you don't have that on
if<00:02:53.670> smart<00:02:54.300> camera<00:02:54.660> pan<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.050> checked<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.590> would

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
if smart camera pan is checked I would

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.160 
if smart camera pan is checked I would
uncheck<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:57.209> makes<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.930> can

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
uncheck that that makes it so you can

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.699 
uncheck that that makes it so you can
skip<00:02:59.040> around<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> map<00:02:59.580> much<00:02:59.760> easier<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.709> would

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
skip around the map much easier I would

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.000 
skip around the map much easier I would

check display build grid turn this on so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640 
check display build grid turn this on so
