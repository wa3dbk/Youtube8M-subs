00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
free safety but I think in the right

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.150 
free safety but I think in the right
scheme<00:01:29.050> he<00:01:29.290> could<00:01:29.440> definitely<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.920> strong

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
scheme he could definitely be a strong

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.890 
scheme he could definitely be a strong
safety<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.000> same<00:01:31.180> goes<00:01:31.330> for<00:01:31.360> Calvin

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
safety and the same goes for Calvin

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.270 
safety and the same goes for Calvin
Pryor<00:01:32.140> from<00:01:32.350> Louisville<00:01:32.680> they're<00:01:32.830> both<00:01:33.010> big

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
Pryor from Louisville they're both big

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.250 
Pryor from Louisville they're both big
hitters<00:01:33.610> but<00:01:34.030> they<00:01:34.180> both<00:01:34.720> have<00:01:34.900> good<00:01:35.050> range

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
hitters but they both have good range

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.960 
hitters but they both have good range
and<00:01:35.530> they<00:01:35.590> could<00:01:35.890> step<00:01:36.160> into<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.460> defensive

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
and they could step into a defensive

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.000 
and they could step into a defensive
play<00:01:37.150> at<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.810> same<00:01:38.050> high<00:01:38.260> level<00:01:38.290> right<00:01:38.770> away

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
play at that same high level right away

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.830 
play at that same high level right away
I<00:01:39.220> think<00:01:39.520> they're<00:01:39.640> similar<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.210> read<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.750> that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
I think they're similar to read and that

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.690 
I think they're similar to read and that
the<00:01:40.960> 49ers<00:01:41.530> would<00:01:41.650> have<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.890> come<00:01:42.130> up<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.460> get

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640 
the 49ers would have to come up to get

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300

that<00:02:28.420> drop<00:02:28.660> off<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> little<00:02:29.110> bit

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
that drop off a little bit

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.230 
that drop off a little bit
I<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.010> concentration<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> lapse

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
I think it's concentration kind of lapse

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.300 
I think it's concentration kind of lapse
at<00:02:31.450> times<00:02:32.110> Wisconsin's<00:02:32.860> Jared<00:02:33.190> Abbrederis

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
at times Wisconsin's Jared Abbrederis

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.490 
at times Wisconsin's Jared Abbrederis
really<00:02:34.180> beat<00:02:34.360> him<00:02:34.390> up<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.840> their<00:02:34.990> matchup<00:02:35.170> but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
really beat him up in their matchup but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.650 
really beat him up in their matchup but
I<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.890> grow<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.940> right<00:02:37.060> system<00:02:37.540> if

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
I think grow be in the right system if

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.880 
I think grow be in the right system if
he's<00:02:37.810> playing<00:02:38.110> up<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.500> line<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.770> scrimmage

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
he's playing up on the line of scrimmage

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.310 
he's playing up on the line of scrimmage
and<00:02:39.280> more<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.580> press<00:02:39.850> man<00:02:40.090> coverage<00:02:41.050> scheme

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and more of a press man coverage scheme

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.810 
and more of a press man coverage scheme
I<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.620> he<00:02:41.710> could<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> very<00:02:42.280> good<00:02:42.550> player

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I think he could be a very good player

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.250 
I think he could be a very good player
and<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.420> someone<00:02:43.660> who<00:02:43.720> could<00:02:43.870> start<00:02:44.110> right

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
and and someone who could start right

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.350 
and and someone who could start right

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
I think the pro days are just as

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.100 
I think the pro days are just as
important<00:03:21.910> Taylor<00:03:22.180> especially<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.840> some

who maybe didn't perform well in

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.110 
who maybe didn't perform well in
Indianapolis<00:03:32.980> have<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> great<00:03:33.489> opportunity<00:03:33.640> to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
Indianapolis have a great opportunity to

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.420 
Indianapolis have a great opportunity to
rebound<00:03:34.570> from<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:35.050> so<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.860> you're<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> running

back receiver corner who didn't run

particularly<00:03:38.890> well<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.550> Lucas<00:03:39.880> Oil<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.330> can

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
particularly well at Lucas Oil you can

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.000 
particularly well at Lucas Oil you can
make<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.900> on<00:03:41.019> your<00:03:41.110> pro<00:03:41.320> day<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.680> that's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
make that up on your pro day and that's

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.320 
make that up on your pro day and that's
the<00:03:42.160> number<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.580> lot<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.820> scouts<00:03:43.150> were

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
the number that a lot of scouts were

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.789 
the number that a lot of scouts were
referenced<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:43.930> draft<00:03:44.200> meetings<00:03:44.620> and

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
referenced in draft meetings and

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.800 
referenced in draft meetings and
especially<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.340> draft<00:03:45.790> day<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.209> think<00:03:46.299> in

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
especially on draft day so I think in

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.050 
especially on draft day so I think in
terms<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:47.230> athletic<00:03:47.739> ability<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.549> positional

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
terms of athletic ability and positional

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.850 
terms of athletic ability and positional
drills<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.570> pro<00:03:49.780> day<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.110> a<00:03:50.320> more<00:03:50.560> comfortable

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
drills a pro day is a more comfortable

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.920 
drills a pro day is a more comfortable
more<00:03:51.220> relaxed<00:03:51.700> setting<00:03:51.730> for<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.180> player<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.420> to

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
more relaxed setting for a player to to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.210 
more relaxed setting for a player to to
kind<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.170> make<00:03:53.350> up<00:03:53.500> some<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.830> ground<00:03:54.070> if

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
kind of make up some of the ground if

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.940 
kind of make up some of the ground if
they<00:03:54.370> did<00:03:54.580> lose<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.299> Indianapolis<00:03:55.989> man<00:03:56.920> I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
they did lose that in Indianapolis man I

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.440 
they did lose that in Indianapolis man I
think<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:57.610> worth<00:03:57.850> mentioning<00:03:58.330> the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
think it's it's worth mentioning the

think it's it's worth mentioning the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.449 
or do they look at Carradine and what
what<00:04:15.280> he<00:04:15.400> brought<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.000> Seminoles<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.600> 2000

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
what he brought to the Seminoles in 2000

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.849 
what he brought to the Seminoles in 2000
2012<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.790> looked<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.150> be<00:04:19.650> building<00:04:20.650> that

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
2012 and looked to be building that

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.560 
2012 and looked to be building that
defensive<00:04:21.310> line<00:04:21.370> with<00:04:21.669> him<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.240> draft

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
defensive line with him and not a draft

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.570 
defensive line with him and not a draft
choice<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> huge<00:04:24.070> fan<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.310> tank

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
choice I was a huge fan of tank

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.190 
choice I was a huge fan of tank
Carradine<00:04:24.820> before<00:04:25.210> he<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.510> hurt<00:04:25.720> he<00:04:25.750> was<00:04:26.080> my

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
Carradine before he got hurt he was my

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.480 
Carradine before he got hurt he was my
number<00:04:26.289> 5<00:04:26.740> overall

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
number 5 overall

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.800 
number 5 overall
player<00:04:27.639> last<00:04:27.910> year<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.360> last<00:04:28.539> year<00:04:28.660> was<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
player last year and last year was a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.270 
player last year and last year was a
pretty<00:04:28.840> good<00:04:29.110> draft<00:04:29.500> class<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:29.889> I<00:04:30.099> think

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
pretty good draft class so I think

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.520 
pretty good draft class so I think
Carradine<00:04:30.789> it<00:04:31.000> can<00:04:31.240> be<00:04:31.360> an<00:04:31.630> eventual<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.410> know

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
Carradine it can be an eventual you know

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.140 
Carradine it can be an eventual you know
guy<00:04:32.710> who<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.009> work<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.370> rotation<00:04:33.880> but<00:04:33.970> then

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
guy who you work in a rotation but then

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.180 
guy who you work in a rotation but then
can<00:04:34.509> eventually<00:04:34.780> hopefully<00:04:35.349> replace<00:04:35.530> Justin

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
can eventually hopefully replace Justin

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.100 
can eventually hopefully replace Justin
Smith<00:04:36.430> at<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.759> right<00:04:36.970> defensive<00:04:37.300> end<00:04:37.599> spot<00:04:37.750> I

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
Smith at that right defensive end spot I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.900 
Smith at that right defensive end spot I
would<00:04:38.440> look<00:04:38.650> at<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.919> nose<00:04:39.130> tackle<00:04:39.340> spot<00:04:39.759> as

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
would look at the nose tackle spot as

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.189 
would look at the nose tackle spot as
maybe<00:04:40.240> an<00:04:40.449> area<00:04:40.690> where<00:04:40.840> they<00:04:40.900> could<00:04:41.050> get<00:04:41.139> a

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
maybe an area where they could get a

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.960 
maybe an area where they could get a
little<00:04:41.410> bit<00:04:41.530> better<00:04:41.650> about<00:04:42.099> Glenn<00:04:42.340> Dorsey<00:04:42.759> did

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
little bit better about Glenn Dorsey did

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.610 
little bit better about Glenn Dorsey did
a<00:04:43.000> great<00:04:43.240> job<00:04:43.270> kind<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:43.990> filling<00:04:44.349> in<00:04:44.470> in

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
a great job kind of filling in in

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.080 
a great job kind of filling in in
position<00:04:45.039> he<00:04:45.160> had<00:04:45.280> never<00:04:45.430> played<00:04:45.580> before

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
position he had never played before

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.909 
position he had never played before
going<00:04:46.300> back<00:04:46.509> to<00:04:46.690> LSU<00:04:46.930> or<00:04:47.259> when<00:04:47.380> he<00:04:47.470> was<00:04:47.530> with

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
going back to LSU or when he was with

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.710 
going back to LSU or when he was with
Kansas<00:04:48.280> City<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> thought<00:04:49.210> he<00:04:49.300> did<00:04:49.509> an

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
Kansas City so I thought he did an

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.809 
Kansas City so I thought he did an
admirable<00:04:49.930> job<00:04:50.259> but<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.889> guy<00:04:51.099> like<00:04:51.130> Luis<00:04:51.550> Nix

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
admirable job but a guy like Luis Nix

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.730 
admirable job but a guy like Luis Nix

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
the defensive line is so important if

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.689 
the defensive line is so important if
you<00:05:01.780> lose<00:05:01.990> Justin<00:05:02.500> Smith<00:05:02.740> or<00:05:03.009> Ray<00:05:03.159> McDonald

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
can come in and back them up so I would

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.089 
can come in and back them up so I would
be<00:05:07.599> surprised<00:05:07.990> with<00:05:08.199> this<00:05:08.349> many<00:05:08.560> picks<00:05:08.830> is<00:05:08.979> the

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
be surprised with this many picks is the

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.249 
be surprised with this many picks is the
Niners<00:05:09.400> have<00:05:09.580> if<00:05:09.759> they<00:05:10.240> went<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.810> more<00:05:11.080> of<00:05:11.139> a

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
Niners have if they went to more of a

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.260 
Niners have if they went to more of a
depth<00:05:11.889> of<00:05:12.039> mentality<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.759> middle<00:05:13.000> rounds

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
depth of mentality in the middle rounds

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.379 
depth of mentality in the middle rounds
to<00:05:13.389> beef<00:05:13.569> up<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.020> front<00:05:14.699> 3:11<00:05:15.699> draft<00:05:15.909> choices

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
to beef up that front 3:11 draft choices

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.700 
to beef up that front 3:11 draft choices
you<00:05:16.479> could<00:05:16.630> almost<00:05:16.780> just<00:05:17.080> go<00:05:17.199> down<00:05:17.349> the<00:05:17.500> depth

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
you could almost just go down the depth

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.350 
you could almost just go down the depth
chart<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.069> add<00:05:18.190> up<00:05:18.310> quality<00:05:18.699> player<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.210> each

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
chart and add up quality player to each

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.570 
chart and add up quality player to each
position<00:05:19.750> group<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.319> it<00:05:20.380> seems<00:05:20.560> like<00:05:20.800> travel

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
position group and it seems like travel

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.879 
position group and it seems like travel
key<00:05:21.759> in<00:05:21.909> is<00:05:22.210> scouting<00:05:22.900> Department<00:05:23.470> they<00:05:23.560> over

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
key in is scouting Department they over

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.499 
key in is scouting Department they over
always<00:05:24.430> value<00:05:24.819> the<00:05:24.940> best<00:05:25.150> player<00:05:25.360> available

always value the best player available

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.300 
always value the best player available

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
so they're never gonna force a fit and

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.950 
so they're never gonna force a fit and
it<00:05:27.460> looks<00:05:27.639> like<00:05:27.849> their<00:05:28.240> track<00:05:28.539> record<00:05:28.900> of

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
it looks like their track record of

it looks like their track record of
finding<00:05:29.319> great<00:05:29.500> players<00:05:29.789> every<00:05:30.789> single<00:05:31.060> round
