00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 she is the party and this maneuver here 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.019
 Do you want to know how to command this video? Give the tip. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.269
 It 's good for you, it 's only a new week. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 Linen and the time you'll have to master 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 two maneuvers, right? 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.240
 is the ninth that the new hype that these 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 two maneuvers have tutorial and in the channel only 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.619
 you take a look and you just do not learn the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.359
 name is not the parallel line as soon as 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.520
 tackles beating the noni and pulling the copel goes 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 fit the new one here, only this way is 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 A bit difficult, right? 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 and then with the time I made myself 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.059
 serve more diagonally as soon as I already 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 I hit a look, it 's funny so, and with 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.629
 Port O weight have here is so kid 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 you have to do it 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:55.410
 hit that foot name will control the pure 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.820
 You'll vote and you 'll see your name goes. 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 Straight ahead, right? 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.829
 there you will see the distance here as well 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.110
 diagonally and hit and kicked here 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.000
 He's going to get up, Alf, that's one. 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 very common mistake that happens is your 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 Name does not hit the ball, will you? 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.939
 here o 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 happen all the time something else is going 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 more as you will see on the diagonal 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 no agency has dog and croft you give 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420
 a sauce here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 but these errors are very common 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.049
 So it's good that you have notion on the basis without 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.829
 that at the time it became law 12 is to kill 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.820
 Inef there, just accept walking on the line. 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.909
 we send championships and then call 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.670
 slow cameras do not put 60 frames in there 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.740
 You'll see pure beauty . 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.149
 a very important tip is you pass 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.880
 that novel, right? 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.090
 here we are not here in the trick on the ball in the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 time 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.570
 the cup 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.040
 a foot position that I put here is the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.380
 next begins the short edge 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.459
 I put this well on top of the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 screw 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.080
 the owner here looks the way I hit 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.890
 carrot and if the ball is taller than I 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.110
 I do 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.459
 A little while later tonight I knew 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.100
 more if I hit only the success kid 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.670
 UN start and see his mother so without O 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 pick up at base 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.330
 Another tip is well kick psd trace 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.620
 go up the pump 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:01.100
 Oh man and see there only then it's just you see 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.019
 faster sending a zero and 12 or 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.870
 you're holding the new name on the track 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.480
 with transition to symnetics payne is well 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.500
 easier because you're going to hit the eye 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.810
 here it will automatically fit 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.120
 alone almost just the same scheme 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.440
 hit name found here turned left or 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.769
 Send one here for you to stay 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:30.709
 connected to rotate the eleven O is minced 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:37.090
 This is easier but this is you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:39.340
 You know something else, you can not teach that. 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.230
 so this is it the person photographed 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.140
 I got there and share the stage. 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.130
 Fishing is we finally hope to learn and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.350
 until the next 21 only now the godoy 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.100
 will send a sauce not for you will you learn 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.190
 huh 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.720
 only he walks with us back there we 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.850
 It's like us back 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.859
 there he does it just so the sheik will last 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:12.939
 but we are bigger 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:18.940
 there I am there, and 3 light who 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:21.070
 Colou and his mother in the live opel aeb good 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.500
 There are a lot of people who have questions. 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.500
 The maneuver is press made by the building.
