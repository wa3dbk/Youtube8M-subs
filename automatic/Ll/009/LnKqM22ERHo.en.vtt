I<00:01:50.430> guess<00:01:50.700> you'd<00:01:50.880> call<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> our

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
I guess you'd call it for all of our

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.870 
I guess you'd call it for all of our
players<00:01:51.990> were<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> color-coded<00:01:53.130> system

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
players were with a color-coded system

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.920 
players were with a color-coded system
so<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.420> needed<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.290> recover<00:01:56.180> faster<00:01:57.180> maybe

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so if you needed to recover faster maybe

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
so if you needed to recover faster maybe
all<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> those<00:01:58.409> dishes<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.070> labeled

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
all of those dishes would be labeled

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.790 
all of those dishes would be labeled
with<00:01:59.579> red<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
with red and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.530 
with red and
need<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.190> add<00:02:01.400> lean<00:02:01.670> muscle<00:02:02.000> mass<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.420> maybe

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
need to add lean muscle mass and maybe

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.570 
need to add lean muscle mass and maybe
label<00:02:02.960> with<00:02:03.080> blue<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.070> don't<00:02:04.250> have<00:02:04.430> to

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
label with blue so you don't have to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.310 
label with blue so you don't have to
actually<00:02:04.940> write<00:02:05.450> things<00:02:05.750> down<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.290> just

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
actually write things down you can just

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
think that's a good choice but I we

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.020 
think that's a good choice but I we
really<00:02:55.100> try<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.310> make<00:02:55.460> sure<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.700> know<00:02:55.880> they're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
really try to make sure you know they're

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.610

it all the time it's one of the it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.020 
it all the time it's one of the it's
probably<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.860> guilty<00:04:02.280> pleasure<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.760> see

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
probably the guilty pleasure that I see

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.289 
probably the guilty pleasure that I see
happening<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.049> most<00:04:04.200> often<00:04:04.670> it's<00:04:05.670> not<00:04:05.910> as<00:04:06.090> bad

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
happening the most often it's not as bad

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.289 
happening the most often it's not as bad
for<00:04:06.329> you<00:04:06.629> as<00:04:06.720> say<00:04:07.590> beer<00:04:07.829> obviously<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:09.090> it's

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
for you as say beer obviously but it's

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.180 
for you as say beer obviously but it's
it's<00:04:09.989> something<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.379> we<00:04:10.440> try<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> stay<00:04:10.859> stay

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190

it's something that we try to stay stay
away<00:04:11.340> from<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.940> that's<00:04:12.030> probably<00:04:12.180> one<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
away from but that's probably one of the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.420 
away from but that's probably one of the
hardest<00:04:12.750> ones<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.049> give<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.410> for<00:04:13.620> sure
