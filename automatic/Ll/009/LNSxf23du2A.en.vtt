00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
team or a very very very good team and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.280 
team or a very very very good team and
there<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:26.489> be<00:03:26.579> other<00:03:26.760> times<00:03:27.060> where<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.870> know

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
there will be other times where you know

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.220 
there will be other times where you know
you'll<00:03:28.650> match<00:03:28.829> up<00:03:29.040> with<00:03:29.160> somebody<00:03:29.459> that's

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
you'll match up with somebody that's

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.330 
you'll match up with somebody that's
they<00:03:31.230> don't<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.590> very<00:03:31.860> good<00:03:31.950> team<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
they don't have a very good team and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.190 
they don't have a very good team and
you'll<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.760> end<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.030> blowing<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.420> out<00:03:33.540> so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.140 
you'll just end up blowing them out so
it's<00:03:34.350> weird<00:03:34.680> how<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> matchmaking<00:03:35.579> works<00:03:35.940> on

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150

because they're known to be a raider but

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.009 
because they're known to be a raider but
just<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:05.549> they<00:04:05.760> didn't<00:04:06.180> Raider<00:04:06.630> at<00:04:06.810> some

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
definitely definitely a good feeling

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.680 
definitely definitely a good feeling
because<00:05:23.850> it's<00:05:24.150> going<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.330> be<00:05:24.390> very<00:05:24.570> difficult

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
because it's going to be very difficult

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.240 
because it's going to be very difficult
for<00:05:25.080> your<00:05:25.290> opponent's<00:05:25.620> come<00:05:25.800> back<00:05:26.010> because

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
for your opponent's come back because

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.090 
for your opponent's come back because
it's<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:27.180> know<00:05:27.210> shorter<00:05:27.810> gains<00:05:28.380> shorter

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
it's you know shorter gains shorter

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.160 
it's you know shorter gains shorter
quarters<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.570> still<00:05:30.930> have<00:05:31.140> that

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
quarters and you still have that

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.200 
quarters and you still have that
accelerated<00:05:31.920> clock<00:05:32.160> so<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.550> does<00:05:32.760> not<00:05:32.940> take

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
accelerated clock so it does not take

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.440 
accelerated clock so it does not take
long<00:05:33.450> for<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:34.350> time<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.830> fly<00:05:35.070> at<00:05:35.340> all<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:36.060> you

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
long for the time to fly at all and you

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.000 
long for the time to fly at all and you
got<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.690> be<00:05:36.930> careful<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.620> don't<00:05:37.800> get

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
got to be careful that you don't get

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.770 
got to be careful that you don't get
down<00:05:38.250> early<00:05:38.280> because<00:05:38.790> otherwise<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.600> could

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
down early because otherwise you could

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.910 
down early because otherwise you could
be<00:05:39.900> in<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.050> position<00:05:40.170> where<00:05:40.440> your<00:05:40.620> opponent's

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
be in a position where your opponent's

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.740 
be in a position where your opponent's
just<00:05:41.070> going<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.250> kill<00:05:41.430> clock<00:05:41.670> and<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.570> run

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
just going to kill clock and you run

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.210 
just going to kill clock and you run
into<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.960> lot<00:05:43.170> of<00:05:43.200> issues<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.680> right<00:05:43.950> there

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
into a lot of issues and right there

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.120 
into a lot of issues and right there
look<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.520> those<00:05:44.670> lob<00:05:44.970> passes<00:05:45.270> man<00:05:45.750> oh<00:05:46.020> my<00:05:46.890> gosh

like that is my one pet peeve right now

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.080 
like that is my one pet peeve right now
on<00:05:49.350> defense<00:05:49.740> is<00:05:49.860> just<00:05:50.130> those<00:05:50.280> live<00:05:50.550> passes

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
on defense is just those live passes

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.330 
on defense is just those live passes
defenders<00:05:51.990> do<00:05:52.110> not<00:05:52.380> react<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.920> him<00:05:53.070> all<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
defenders do not react to him all the

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.460 
defenders do not react to him all the
time<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.300> people<00:05:54.570> just<00:05:54.720> get<00:05:55.020> away<00:05:55.290> with

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
time so people just get away with

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.350 
time so people just get away with
throwing<00:05:55.650> live<00:05:56.010> streaks<00:05:56.460> and<00:05:56.700> just<00:05:56.910> slop<00:05:57.120> in

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
throwing live streaks and just slop in

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.350 
throwing live streaks and just slop in
it<00:05:57.510> all<00:05:57.900> over<00:05:58.350> the<00:05:58.440> place<00:05:58.850> and<00:05:59.850> just<00:06:00.060> getting

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
it all over the place and just getting

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.820 
it all over the place and just getting
away<00:06:00.450> with<00:06:00.750> making<00:06:00.930> really<00:06:01.260> bad<00:06:01.380> passes

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
away with making really bad passes

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.850 
away with making really bad passes
really<00:06:02.310> bad<00:06:02.490> past<00:06:02.790> decisions<00:06:03.180> and<00:06:03.860> ultimately

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
really bad past decisions and ultimately

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.550 
really bad past decisions and ultimately
just<00:06:05.430> you<00:06:05.850> know<00:06:05.940> not<00:06:06.290> making<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.380> right<00:06:07.530> reads

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
just you know not making the right reads

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.410 
just you know not making the right reads
and<00:06:08.010> things<00:06:08.160> like<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.340> in<00:06:08.640> there<00:06:08.820> not<00:06:09.180> being

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
and things like that in there not being

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.210 
and things like that in there not being
penalized<00:06:09.810> for<00:06:10.170> it<00:06:10.350> so<00:06:10.620> that's<00:06:10.800> hopefully

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
penalized for it so that's hopefully

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.010 
penalized for it so that's hopefully
something<00:06:11.490> that<00:06:11.730> will<00:06:11.850> change<00:06:12.090> for<00:06:12.750> next

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
something that will change for next

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.260
