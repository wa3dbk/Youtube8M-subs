00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.280 
week 16 pics in this thursday game i'm
picking<00:00:08.880> indianapolis<00:00:09.480> over<00:00:09.719> Jacksonville

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
picking indianapolis over Jacksonville

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.770 
picking indianapolis over Jacksonville
so<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.889> think<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.160> mediocre<00:00:11.519> Jaguar<00:00:12.330> defense

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
so I think this mediocre Jaguar defense

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.480 
so I think this mediocre Jaguar defense
will<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:12.990> no<00:00:13.230> problem<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.590> mining<00:00:13.980> company<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
will be no problem for mining company to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.700 
will be no problem for mining company to
win<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.630> think<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.260> step<00:00:16.440> closer

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
win and I think to get one step closer

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.290 
win and I think to get one step closer
to<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> playoffs<00:00:17.420> in<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.199> Saturday<00:00:19.650> game<00:00:20.300> I'm
