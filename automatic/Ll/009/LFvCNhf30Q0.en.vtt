00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.709 
because it reacts with the baking soda
to<00:01:00.719> release<00:01:01.170> carbon<00:01:01.410> dioxide<00:01:02.420> finally<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.600> can

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to release carbon dioxide finally we can

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
to release carbon dioxide finally we can
add<00:01:03.870> our<00:01:04.019> dry<00:01:04.049> ingredients<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> base
