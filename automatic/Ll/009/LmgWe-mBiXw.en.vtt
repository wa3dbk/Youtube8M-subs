00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.300 

usually<00:00:03.759> we<00:00:03.879> start<00:00:04.210> with<00:00:04.450> a<00:00:04.480> square<00:00:04.960> wire<00:00:05.310> we

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
usually we start with a square wire we

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.160 
usually we start with a square wire we
will<00:00:06.490> roll<00:00:06.790> it<00:00:06.970> down<00:00:07.179> to<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:07.960> right

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
will roll it down to the right

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.380 
will roll it down to the right
measurement<00:00:08.800> and<00:00:09.610> then<00:00:10.620> roll<00:00:11.620> it<00:00:11.880> into<00:00:12.880> flat

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.390 
measurement and then roll it into flat

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.179 
measurement and then roll it into flat
piece<00:00:13.720> which<00:00:14.620> is<00:00:14.860> just<00:00:15.490> a<00:00:15.639> little<00:00:15.849> bit<00:00:16.090> bigger

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
piece which is just a little bit bigger

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:36.380 
piece which is just a little bit bigger
than<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.300> section<00:00:19.720> of<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.080> Ring<00:00:20.230> we<00:00:21.160> need

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.310 

because<00:00:37.230> by<00:00:37.739> rolling<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:39.239> making<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> masala

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
because by rolling we making the masala

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.450 
because by rolling we making the masala
harder<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> anneal<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:43.129> at<00:00:44.129> least

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
harder you have to anneal it at least

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.939 
harder you have to anneal it at least
every<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.270> third<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:46.370> material<00:00:48.079> down<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.470> mean

every one third of material down I mean

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.710 
every one third of material down I mean
the<00:00:50.129> small<00:00:50.430> ones<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.530> regular<00:00:52.530> volume<00:00:53.660> buy<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
the small ones we regular volume buy it

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.680 
the small ones we regular volume buy it
by<00:00:55.260> one-third<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.940> heat<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.480> whole

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
by one-third we have to heat the whole

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.219 
by one-third we have to heat the whole
piece<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:03.329> red<00:01:04.339> color<00:01:05.420> which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> temperature

piece to red color which is temperature

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
piece to red color which is temperature
high<00:01:07.440> enough<00:01:07.820> for<00:01:08.820> Michelle<00:01:09.030> who<00:01:09.690> gets<00:01:10.229> often

high enough for Michelle who gets often
again<00:01:12.770> if<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.039> don't<00:01:14.190> do<00:01:14.399> this<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.240> matter

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
again if we don't do this the matter

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.120 
again if we don't do this the matter
will<00:01:15.899> be<00:01:18.560> very<00:01:19.560> hard<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.190> work<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.970> also

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
will be very hard to work with and also

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
will be very hard to work with and also
put<00:01:23.130> crack<00:01:24.229> which<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.440> don't<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:26.210> once<00:01:27.210> we

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
put crack which we don't want once we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.270 
put crack which we don't want once we
have<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.690> right<00:01:27.869> measurements<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.890> mark

the land for the ring and then before

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.640 
the land for the ring and then before
cutting<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:40.770> paint<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.840> area<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.380> will

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
cutting we paint the area which will

for<00:01:57.329> tapping<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.899> used<00:02:00.890> quite<00:02:01.890> coarse<00:02:02.340> saw

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
for tapping we used quite coarse saw

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
once we have it all cut um we can round

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.590 
once we have it all cut um we can round
it<00:02:30.900> form<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:32.140> circle<00:02:33.270> usually<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.330> pretty

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.430 
it form a circle usually is pretty
potato<00:02:35.080> shape<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.100> we'll<00:02:36.700> try<00:02:36.970> our<00:02:37.180> best

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
potato shape but we'll try our best

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.020 
potato shape but we'll try our best
however<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.800> not<00:02:38.890> necessary<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> get<00:02:39.850> it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
however it's not necessary to get it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.860 
however it's not necessary to get it
perfect<00:02:40.510> because<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.710> tools<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:43.690> will

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
perfect because we have tools we will

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.650 
perfect because we have tools we will
use<00:02:44.020> later

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
use later

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:57.110 
use later
we'll<00:02:46.080> make<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.620> perfect<00:02:55.340> before<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.700> final

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
we'll make it perfect before the final

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.660 
we'll make it perfect before the final
touch<00:02:57.300> up<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.930> joint<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.310> anneal

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
touch up on the joint we have to anneal

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.340 
touch up on the joint we have to anneal
it<00:02:59.700> once<00:03:00.180> more<00:03:00.510> again<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.770> when<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:02.520> heat<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.850> up

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
it once more again so when we heat it up

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.850 
it once more again so when we heat it up
for<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.530> soldering<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.990> doesn't<00:03:07.470> open

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
for the soldering but it doesn't open

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.080 
for the soldering but it doesn't open
for<00:03:08.370> us<00:03:10.520> find<00:03:11.520> out<00:03:11.900> now<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.960> final<00:03:13.350> touch<00:03:13.680> up

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
for us find out now the final touch up

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.400 
for us find out now the final touch up
for<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.210> joint<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.720> am<00:03:17.660> using<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.840> fine

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
for the joint is really am using a fine

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.380 
for the joint is really am using a fine
needle<00:03:20.130> file<00:03:20.370> or<00:03:20.970> even<00:03:21.240> sandpaper<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:24.000> ensure

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
needle file or even sandpaper to ensure

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.410 
needle file or even sandpaper to ensure
that<00:03:24.950> both<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.280> sides<00:03:26.490> of<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> choice<00:03:27.150> of

that both of the sides of the choice of
perfectly<00:03:28.020> furloughs<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.950> clean<00:03:29.850> which<00:03:30.690> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
perfectly furloughs and clean which is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.660 
perfectly furloughs and clean which is
also<00:03:31.110> really<00:03:31.560> important<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.920> woke<00:03:35.100> up<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
also really important we woke up to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.030 
also really important we woke up to
small<00:03:36.270> pieces<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:37.920> folder<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.440> place<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.770> on

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
small pieces of folder and place it on

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.850 
small pieces of folder and place it on
each<00:03:41.580> side<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.020> join

this<00:03:47.460> will<00:03:49.340> allow<00:03:50.340> us<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.790> achieve<00:03:50.910> perfect

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
this will allow us to achieve perfect

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.650 
this will allow us to achieve perfect

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.430 
flat as it was a rounded in hand on by
machine<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:07.910> we<00:05:08.240> will<00:05:08.419> use<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> hammer<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.320> a

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
machine so we will use a hammer and a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.429 
machine so we will use a hammer and a
steel<00:05:09.740> anvil<00:05:11.139> make<00:05:12.139> you<00:05:12.320> flat

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:21.029 

after<00:05:17.439> this<00:05:17.589> we'll<00:05:17.919> use<00:05:17.979> a<00:05:18.249> course<00:05:18.580> file<00:05:20.039> to

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
after this we'll use a course file to

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.919 
after this we'll use a course file to
achieve<00:05:21.779> perfection<00:05:22.779> and<00:05:24.209> of<00:05:25.209> course<00:05:25.569> just

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:25.929 
achieve perfection and of course just

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:29.609 
achieve perfection and of course just
like<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.409> the<00:05:26.589> other<00:05:26.949> part<00:05:27.759> of<00:05:27.939> ring<00:05:28.509> the<00:05:29.379> roof

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
like on the other part of ring the roof

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.570 
like on the other part of ring the roof
also<00:05:29.949> sent<00:05:30.459> papers<00:05:30.909> from<00:05:31.599> coarse<00:05:31.929> to<00:05:32.199> fine<00:05:32.580> and

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
also sent papers from coarse to fine and

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:45.290 
also sent papers from coarse to fine and
of<00:05:34.169> Indian<00:05:35.169> was<00:05:35.589> ok

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.510 

now<00:05:45.659> would<00:05:46.020> be<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.229> good<00:05:46.530> time<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:47.009> check<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
now would be a good time to check the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.860 
now would be a good time to check the
sides<00:05:47.990> inside

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
sides inside

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.030 
sides inside
having<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.650> size

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.020 

in<00:05:54.520> this<00:05:54.760> case<00:05:55.660> we<00:05:56.500> majoring<00:05:57.070> slightly<00:05:57.700> bigger

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.810 

so<00:06:01.030> we<00:06:01.210> will<00:06:01.390> have<00:06:01.450> to<00:06:01.870> size<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.320> down<00:06:02.580> this<00:06:03.580> is

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
so we will have to size it down this is

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.890 
so we will have to size it down this is
usually<00:06:04.030> done<00:06:04.300> by<00:06:05.160> pushing<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.490> into<00:06:07.090> a<00:06:07.450> small

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
usually done by pushing it into a small

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.000 
usually done by pushing it into a small
role<00:06:08.940> which<00:06:09.940> sides<00:06:10.270> without<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.590> have<00:06:11.800> to

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
role which sides without you have to

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.480 
role which sides without you have to
turn<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.670> ring<00:06:12.820> for<00:06:13.150> base<00:06:14.070> so<00:06:15.070> we<00:06:15.100> had<00:06:15.460> a

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
turn the ring for base so we had a

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.910 
turn the ring for base so we had a
perfect<00:06:16.060> surrender<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:19.750> the<00:06:20.320> sauce<00:06:20.590> will

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
perfect surrender and the sauce will

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.770 
perfect surrender and the sauce will
have<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.280> measure<00:06:21.460> it<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.060> whole<00:06:22.300> place<00:06:22.570> as

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
have to measure it to the whole place as

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.380 
have to measure it to the whole place as
well<00:06:23.940> to<00:06:24.940> ensure<00:06:25.090> that<00:06:25.750> both<00:06:26.440> in<00:06:27.130> children<00:06:27.790> are

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
well to ensure that both in children are

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.280 
well to ensure that both in children are
protected<00:06:28.960> parallel<00:06:30.030> then<00:06:31.030> we<00:06:31.270> tidy<00:06:31.570> up<00:06:31.840> the

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
protected parallel then we tidy up the

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.520 
protected parallel then we tidy up the
surface<00:06:32.940> again<00:06:33.940> with<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.270> file<00:06:34.540> and<00:06:34.930> the

surface again with a file and the

00:06:35.530 --> 00:07:01.120
