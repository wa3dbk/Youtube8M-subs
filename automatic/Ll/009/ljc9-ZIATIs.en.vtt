00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.059
 automatic control system 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.370
 temperatures in the greenhouse 0 another place where 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.240
 need to regulate 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.240
 the temperature 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.550
 exploded it looks like this 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.980
 and tarmo sensor 1 plate 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.100
 automatic 1 magnetic starter 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 this case is used 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:51.530
 heater black master 3 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:55.910
 kilowatt here there is thermo disconnect 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.770
 but there is no graduation that you specifically 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.140
 degrees is set so i am definitely more 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.680
 accurate measurement 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:11.680
 use thermo sensor German company 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 eberle 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.480
 its capacity is 3 to 3 km from the load 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.480
 but 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:27.869
 In this case, the load is 33 kilowatts for 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.960
 avoid quick failure 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.740
 Thermal sensor device used 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:44.789
 magnetic starter but 1 25 amps 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 principle of connection through the machine on here 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:52.560
 served phase automatic on base 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.200
 removed and under from as it should be 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 top sponge contact on top contact 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.409
 he is also fed parallel coil 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.209
 which turns off the magnetic 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.209
 starter here on the terminal 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 one 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:22.400
 Klim and 2 coils 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 removed here and served 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:33.680
 to the input of the thermostat benefit 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.840
 thermostat and no wire returns 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.380
 on 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.380
 removing 0 which goes to the shield 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 from here the socket is fed into which 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:55.970
 lowered god powered socket which 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.880
 the device feeds there will be a phase here zero 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.360
 all three phases and night 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.459
 here's a magnetic starter 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:14.209
 installed on thermal sensors 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.209
 temperature in 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.600
 do 15 degrees now one box 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.590
 good on the form looks like this 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.590
 know the wheel temperature 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.099
 Present moment 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 degrees 11 feet down 15 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.680
 the temperature 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:33.020
 here comes the shutdown at 9 degrees 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:36.300
 device is off target gone off 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.370
 so if the temperature is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.370
 below established 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.319
 brute force will turn on and heat up to 

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:49.439
 the required temperature is allowed up to 10 times 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.719
 as the device is turned on for twenty minutes 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:55.259
 back still the temperature has not warmed up with 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:05:01.159
 home temperature sensors to accurately 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.159
 triggered and reached another scale 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:04.909
 Thanks for attention
