and<00:00:21.280> this<00:00:22.280> is<00:00:22.430> where<00:00:22.580> we<00:00:22.730> get<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.000> name<00:00:23.030> alkali

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
and this is where we get the name alkali

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.750 
and this is where we get the name alkali
metals<00:00:24.230> for<00:00:24.500> this<00:00:24.650> group<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.100> metals<00:00:25.400> if<00:00:25.610> you

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
metals for this group of metals if you

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.220 
metals for this group of metals if you
throw<00:00:26.000> one<00:00:26.150> of<00:00:26.240> these<00:00:26.300> metals<00:00:26.660> into<00:00:26.780> water<00:00:27.080> you

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
throw one of these metals into water you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.060 
throw one of these metals into water you
end<00:00:27.530> up<00:00:27.680> making<00:00:27.800> an<00:00:28.100> alkaline<00:00:28.640> solution<00:00:30.070> but

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
end up making an alkaline solution but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.470 
end up making an alkaline solution but
you<00:00:31.130> should<00:00:31.460> never<00:00:31.580> take<00:00:31.850> my<00:00:32.000> word<00:00:32.180> for

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
you should never take my word for

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.209 
you should never take my word for
something<00:00:32.899> when<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.170> say<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.800> should<00:00:33.860> say

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
something when I say that you should say

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.790 
something when I say that you should say
prove<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.920> go<00:00:37.100> here<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.730> we<00:00:38.060> go<00:00:38.240> here

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
prove it and we go here and we go here

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.600 
prove it and we go here and we go here
so<00:00:39.800> let's<00:00:40.040> prove<00:00:40.220> it

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
so let's prove it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.430 
so let's prove it

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
we have there we go a couple of samples

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.910 
we have there we go a couple of samples
of<00:01:02.390> some<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.750> these<00:01:02.809> metals<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.350> first<00:01:03.530> one<00:01:03.770> is

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
of some of these metals the first one is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
of some of these metals the first one is
sodium<00:01:04.309> that's<00:01:04.579> not<00:01:04.759> very<00:01:04.939> focused<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.540> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.139 

I'm<00:01:13.350> trying<00:01:15.200> sumo<00:01:16.200> sumo<00:01:16.500> oh<00:01:18.799> there<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
I'm trying sumo sumo oh there we go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.209 
I'm trying sumo sumo oh there we go
now<00:01:21.259> now<00:01:22.259> we've<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> focus<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.039> thing

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
now now we've got to focus the thing

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.090 
now now we've got to focus the thing
that<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:25.049> used<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.319> this<00:01:25.469> great<00:01:25.649> camera

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that we used to have this great camera

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.410 
that we used to have this great camera
down<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.579> then<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.789> spend<00:01:26.969> ten<00:01:27.210> times

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
down here and then they spend ten times

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.569 
down here and then they spend ten times
as<00:01:27.600> much<00:01:27.719> money<00:01:27.929> on<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> useless<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:31.459> are<00:01:32.459> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
as much money on a useless one are you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.870 
as much money on a useless one are you
fighting<00:01:32.939> me<00:01:33.030> upstairs<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> focus<00:01:34.880> yes

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
fighting me upstairs with the focus yes

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.849 
fighting me upstairs with the focus yes
okay<00:01:36.359> I'll<00:01:36.509> let<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.750> focus<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> upstairs

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
okay I'll let them focus it upstairs

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.410 
okay I'll let them focus it upstairs
there<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.159> go<00:01:38.390> now<00:01:39.709> sodium<00:01:40.969> so<00:01:41.969> we<00:01:42.149> have<00:01:42.270> some

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
there we go now sodium so we have some

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.449 
there we go now sodium so we have some
sodium<00:01:42.719> inside<00:01:42.929> here<00:01:43.259> Oh<00:01:43.380> much<00:01:43.619> better<00:01:43.649> okay

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
sodium inside here Oh much better okay

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.069 
sodium inside here Oh much better okay
there<00:01:44.609> we<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.819> now<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.989> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
there we go now you can see in the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.210 
there we go now you can see in the
bottom<00:01:46.349> of<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.679> know<00:01:46.739> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.039> see<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
bottom of this I know if you can see it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.440 
bottom of this I know if you can see it
or<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.819> sort<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.179> an<00:01:48.299> oily

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
or not but there's a sort of an oily

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
or not but there's a sort of an oily
liquid<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.049> over<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> side<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
liquid but over on this side there is a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.649 
liquid but over on this side there is a
blob<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.700> sodium<00:01:50.969> metal<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.539> going

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
blob of sodium metal so what I'm going

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.440 
blob of sodium metal so what I'm going
to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.369> take<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.429> beaker<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.819> water<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to do is take a beaker of water and I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
to do is take a beaker of water and I
made<00:01:57.629> the<00:01:57.780> statement<00:01:57.989> that<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.679> you<00:01:59.280> react

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
made the statement that if you react

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
made the statement that if you react
these<00:01:59.909> metals<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.450> water<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> an

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
these metals with water you get an

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.529 
these metals with water you get an
alkaline<00:02:01.530> solution<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
alkaline solution so how you going to

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.789 
alkaline solution so how you going to
make<00:02:03.599> a<00:02:03.689> solution<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.259> throw<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> piece<00:02:04.679> of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
make a solution you throw a piece of

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.899 
make a solution you throw a piece of
iron<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.219> water<00:02:05.429> you<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:05.729> make<00:02:05.879> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
iron into water you don't make a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
iron into water you don't make a
solution<00:02:06.239> but<00:02:06.569> let's<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.379> what<00:02:07.500> happens<00:02:07.560> when

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
solution but let's see what happens when

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.080 
solution but let's see what happens when
you<00:02:08.069> throw<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> piece<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> sodium<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.060> water

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you throw a piece of sodium into water

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.119 
you throw a piece of sodium into water
so<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> bring<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.500> over<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.950> take

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
so I'm going to bring this over and take

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.449 
so I'm going to bring this over and take
a<00:02:11.160> piece<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> sodium<00:02:11.849> out<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:14.040> oil<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
a piece of sodium out of this the oil is

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.250 
a piece of sodium out of this the oil is
just<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.790> keep<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> air<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.450> water<00:02:15.660> away<00:02:15.870> from

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
just to keep the air and water away from

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
just to keep the air and water away from
it<00:02:16.579> for<00:02:17.579> reasons<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.000> will<00:02:18.239> become<00:02:18.359> apparent

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it for reasons that will become apparent

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.400 
it for reasons that will become apparent
in<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.049> moment<00:02:19.819> so<00:02:20.819> there's<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> piece<00:02:21.359> of<00:02:21.569> sodium

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
in a moment so there's a piece of sodium

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.140 
in a moment so there's a piece of sodium
metal<00:02:22.970> okay

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
metal okay

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
metal okay
so<00:02:24.720> doesn't<00:02:25.049> look<00:02:25.230> very<00:02:25.260> metallic<00:02:25.859> there<00:02:26.040> but

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so doesn't look very metallic there but

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.890 
so doesn't look very metallic there but
let<00:02:26.370> me<00:02:26.459> grab<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> tweezers<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.690> cut

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
let me grab it with the tweezers and cut

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.629 
let me grab it with the tweezers and cut
it<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.109> said<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.440> was<00:02:28.530> also<00:02:28.859> these<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.459> very

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
it I said it was also these are very

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.490 
it I said it was also these are very
soft<00:02:29.910> metals<00:02:30.359> this<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.959> spatula<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
soft metals this is just a spatula so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.750 
soft metals this is just a spatula so
I'm<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.799> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> cut<00:02:32.220> into<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> thing

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I'm just going to cut into the thing

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.550 
I'm just going to cut into the thing
with<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> edge<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.079> this<00:02:34.200> spatula<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:37.380> just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
with the edge of this spatula it just

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.640 
with the edge of this spatula it just
cuts<00:02:37.829> kind<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.849> hard<00:02:39.060> butter<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.650> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
cuts kind of like hard butter and then

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.920 
cuts kind of like hard butter and then
I'm<00:02:40.769> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.030> tip<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.060> thing<00:02:42.269> up<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:42.780> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
I'm going to tip this thing up so that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.629 
I'm going to tip this thing up so that
you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.169> see<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.829> actually<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.310> shiny

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
you can see that it is actually a shiny

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.970 
you can see that it is actually a shiny
metal<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.389> know<00:02:45.540> if<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.720> can<00:02:45.870> see<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> shiny

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
metal you know if you can see the shiny

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.589 
metal you know if you can see the shiny
edge<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.489> down<00:02:47.669> at<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.880> bottom<00:02:48.030> see<00:02:48.419> that

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
edge there down at the bottom see that

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.349 
edge there down at the bottom see that
that's<00:02:49.290> sort<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.590> glint<00:02:49.889> down<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
that's sort of glint down here so this

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.750 
that's sort of glint down here so this
is<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> soft<00:02:52.079> shiny<00:02:52.349> metal<00:02:52.590> that's<00:02:53.340> kind<00:02:53.639> of<00:02:53.669> a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is a soft shiny metal that's kind of a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.099 
is a soft shiny metal that's kind of a
big<00:02:53.910> piece<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.329> don't<00:02:54.510> think<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.750> want<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> risk

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
big piece I don't think I want to risk

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.699 
big piece I don't think I want to risk
my<00:02:55.200> life<00:02:55.470> quite<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> piece<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.989> big<00:02:58.230> now

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
my life quite with a piece that big now

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.830 
my life quite with a piece that big now
I<00:02:58.739> said<00:02:59.040> these<00:02:59.190> things<00:02:59.340> react<00:02:59.760> with<00:03:00.000> water<00:03:00.209> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
I said these things react with water to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.629 
I said these things react with water to
form<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.200> alkaline<00:03:01.590> solution<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.220> how<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.489> we

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
form an alkaline solution so how can we

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.860 
form an alkaline solution so how can we
prove<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.329> an<00:03:03.450> alkaline<00:03:03.840> solution

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
prove that it's an alkaline solution

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.979 
prove that it's an alkaline solution
well<00:03:04.440> I'll<00:03:05.160> take<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> water<00:03:05.669> here<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.900> I'm

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
well I'll take the water here then I'm

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.750 
well I'll take the water here then I'm
going<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.139> put<00:03:07.349> some<00:03:07.560> acid<00:03:08.549> base<00:03:08.730> indicator

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
going to put some acid base indicator

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.930 
going to put some acid base indicator
into<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.579> little<00:03:11.760> bit<00:03:11.849> of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
into it so it's a little bit of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.580 
into it so it's a little bit of
phenolphthalein<00:03:12.389> this<00:03:12.750> will<00:03:12.900> turn<00:03:13.049> pink<00:03:13.319> if

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
phenolphthalein this will turn pink if

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.080 
phenolphthalein this will turn pink if
the<00:03:14.220> solution<00:03:14.669> becomes<00:03:15.000> alkaline<00:03:15.269> or<00:03:17.090> my

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the solution becomes alkaline or my

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.490 
the solution becomes alkaline or my
cover<00:03:18.359> go

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
cover go

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.479 
cover go
okay<00:03:20.500> piece<00:03:21.219> of<00:03:21.400> sodium<00:03:21.760> metal<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.599> water

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
okay piece of sodium metal and water

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.890 
okay piece of sodium metal and water
turns<00:03:24.489> pink<00:03:24.760> immediately<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.719> see

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
turns pink immediately so you can see

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.929 
turns pink immediately so you can see
that<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.379> a<00:03:26.409> an<00:03:27.250> alkaline<00:03:27.909> solution

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
that this is a an alkaline solution

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.380 
that this is a an alkaline solution
hence<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.900> alkali<00:03:29.500> metal<00:03:29.829> this<00:03:30.760> reaction<00:03:31.269> is

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
hence the alkali metal this reaction is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.640 
hence the alkali metal this reaction is
violent<00:03:31.780> enough<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.260> thing<00:03:32.439> actually

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
violent enough that the thing actually

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.869 
violent enough that the thing actually
catches<00:03:33.159> fire<00:03:38.310> actually<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.430> making<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.730> neat

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
catches fire actually it's making a neat

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:51.320 
catches fire actually it's making a neat
noise

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.220 

Oh<00:03:53.030> sizzles<00:03:54.030> away<00:03:54.240> this<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.660> type<00:03:55.050> of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
Oh sizzles away this is the type of

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.630 
Oh sizzles away this is the type of
reason<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.620> firemen<00:03:56.040> want<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.400> what's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
reason that firemen want to know what's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.880 
reason that firemen want to know what's
in<00:03:56.820> your<00:03:56.940> lab<00:03:57.150> before<00:03:57.630> they<00:03:57.750> come<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.650> know<00:03:58.680> if

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
in your lab before they come you know if

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.860 
in your lab before they come you know if
you<00:03:58.980> got<00:03:59.430> some<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.970> your<00:04:00.000> lab<00:04:00.240> spring

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
you got some of this in your lab spring

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.270 
you got some of this in your lab spring
water<00:04:01.110> is<00:04:01.290> not<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> good<00:04:01.620> idea<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:04.460> that's<00:04:05.460> I

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
water is not a good idea so that's I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.550 
water is not a good idea so that's I
think<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.550> got<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.910> again<00:04:08.970> don't<00:04:09.330> you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.530 

bigger<00:04:13.190> piece<00:04:13.459> okay<00:04:15.910> really<00:04:16.910> wish<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.239> had<00:04:17.389> that

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
bigger piece okay really wish I had that

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:28.600 
bigger piece okay really wish I had that
cover<00:04:17.810> here<00:04:19.150> okay<00:04:27.280> sometimes<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.430> catches

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
cover here okay sometimes it catches

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.120 
cover here okay sometimes it catches
fire<00:04:28.820> sometimes<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.570> doesn't<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.020> we'll<00:04:30.650> I

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
fire sometimes it doesn't and we'll I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.550 
fire sometimes it doesn't and we'll I
like<00:04:32.090> teaching<00:04:32.480> in<00:04:32.570> this<00:04:32.690> classroom<00:04:33.290> because

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
like teaching in this classroom because

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:46.090 
like teaching in this classroom because
there<00:04:33.680> are<00:04:33.740> no<00:04:33.830> smoke<00:04:34.070> alarms

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.210 

okay<00:04:47.300> that's<00:04:48.300> sodium<00:04:48.680> not<00:04:49.680> only<00:04:49.950> do<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.190> find

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
okay that's sodium not only do we find

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.340 
okay that's sodium not only do we find
similar<00:04:50.790> chemistry<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.480> row<00:04:51.630> but<00:04:51.900> we've<00:04:52.080> in

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
similar chemistry in a row but we've in

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.280 
similar chemistry in a row but we've in
a<00:04:52.410> group<00:04:52.620> but<00:04:52.830> we<00:04:52.950> find<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.370> progression<00:04:53.850> of

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
a group but we find a progression of

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.870 
a group but we find a progression of
some<00:04:55.290> of<00:04:55.380> these<00:04:55.440> properties<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.490> atomic

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
some of these properties the atomic

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.430 
some of these properties the atomic
weight<00:04:57.030> gets<00:04:57.270> larger<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.840> go<00:04:58.050> down<00:04:58.230> the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
weight gets larger as you go down the

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:08.570 
weight gets larger as you go down the
group<00:04:58.790> and<00:05:01.430> reactivities<00:05:02.430> often<00:05:02.880> increase<00:05:07.580> we

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
group and reactivities often increase we

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.670 
group and reactivities often increase we
expect<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.150> same<00:05:09.390> sort<00:05:09.780> of<00:05:09.840> behavior<00:05:09.960> for<00:05:10.500> any

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
expect the same sort of behavior for any

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.640 
expect the same sort of behavior for any
element<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.220> group<00:05:12.060> number<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:13.410> we<00:05:13.560> have

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
element in group number one so we have

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.580 
element in group number one so we have
hydrogen<00:05:14.190> lithium<00:05:14.700> sodium<00:05:15.540> below<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.440> is

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
hydrogen lithium sodium below that is

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.800 
hydrogen lithium sodium below that is
potassium<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.000> is<00:05:18.120> there<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.360> can<00:05:18.600> see

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
potassium and it is there you can see

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.980 
potassium and it is there you can see
the<00:05:19.560> shiny<00:05:19.860> part<00:05:20.160> there<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:21.480> you<00:05:21.570> know<00:05:21.780> the

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
the shiny part there so you know the

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.720 
the shiny part there so you know the
solutions<00:05:22.440> alkaline<00:05:22.980> already<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.430> would<00:05:23.580> also

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
solutions alkaline already it would also

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.420 
solutions alkaline already it would also
turn<00:05:24.030> alkaline<00:05:24.510> with<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.340> introduction<00:05:26.340> of

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
turn alkaline with the introduction of

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.090 
turn alkaline with the introduction of
potassium<00:05:27.000> but<00:05:27.690> just<00:05:27.960> maybe<00:05:28.590> I'll<00:05:28.770> take<00:05:28.920> that

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
potassium but just maybe I'll take that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.280 
potassium but just maybe I'll take that
big<00:05:29.310> chunk<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.760> just<00:05:29.880> put<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.090> away<00:05:33.290> where

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
big chunk and just put that away where

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.170 
big chunk and just put that away where
you<00:05:34.320> want<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.590> see<00:05:34.740> me<00:05:34.890> die<00:05:35.070> or<00:05:35.370> what<00:05:38.030> okay<00:05:39.030> this

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
you want to see me die or what okay this

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.760 
you want to see me die or what okay this
is<00:05:39.390> a<00:05:39.419> much<00:05:39.630> smaller<00:05:39.960> piece<00:05:40.230> than<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.620> piece

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
is a much smaller piece than the piece

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.720 
is a much smaller piece than the piece
of<00:05:40.919> sodium<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.490> put<00:05:41.760> in<00:05:42.440> instant<00:05:43.440> flame

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
of sodium that I put in instant flame

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.870 
of sodium that I put in instant flame
very<00:05:44.730> much<00:05:44.940> Pinker<00:05:45.630> flame<00:05:45.870> hotter<00:05:46.200> flame<00:05:46.880> and

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
very much Pinker flame hotter flame and

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.420 
very much Pinker flame hotter flame and
the<00:05:48.120> reaction<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.690> almost<00:05:49.500> gone<00:05:49.770> they're

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
the reaction is almost gone they're

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.270 
the reaction is almost gone they're
booms<00:05:50.820> gone<00:05:51.680> well<00:05:52.680> okay<00:05:52.950> we'll<00:05:53.070> put<00:05:53.220> the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
booms gone well okay we'll put the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.750 
booms gone well okay we'll put the
bigger<00:05:53.430> piece<00:05:55.040> that's<00:05:56.040> a<00:05:56.100> lot<00:05:56.220> more<00:05:56.340> fun<00:05:56.400> isn't

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
bigger piece that's a lot more fun isn't

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.719 
bigger piece that's a lot more fun isn't
it

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.279 

somebody<00:06:03.729> brought<00:06:03.910> in<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.210> movie<00:06:04.539> last<00:06:04.750> year<00:06:04.960> a

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
somebody brought in a movie last year a

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.800 
somebody brought in a movie last year a
couple<00:06:06.009> years<00:06:06.159> ago<00:06:06.449> something<00:06:07.449> they<00:06:07.569> did<00:06:07.720> in

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
couple years ago something they did in

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.210 
couple years ago something they did in
high<00:06:07.960> school<00:06:07.990> they<00:06:08.409> had<00:06:08.530> a<00:06:08.560> piece<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.919> sodium

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
high school they had a piece of sodium

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.240 
high school they had a piece of sodium
about<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.669> size<00:06:09.879> of<00:06:10.090> their<00:06:10.210> forearm<00:06:11.009> we<00:06:12.009> threw

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
about the size of their forearm we threw

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.999 
about the size of their forearm we threw
it<00:06:12.340> off<00:06:12.460> a<00:06:12.490> bridge<00:06:12.729> into<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.150> river<00:06:13.389> and<00:06:14.009> it's

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
it off a bridge into a river and it's

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.469 
it off a bridge into a river and it's
sank<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.520> I<00:06:15.580> guess<00:06:15.729> it<00:06:15.879> took<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.150> few<00:06:16.300> minutes

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
sank and I guess it took a few minutes

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.869 
sank and I guess it took a few minutes
or<00:06:16.810> seconds<00:06:17.259> anyway<00:06:17.590> for<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:17.949> water<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.759> get

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:18.879 
or seconds anyway for the water to get

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.180 
or seconds anyway for the water to get
through<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.240> oil<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.780> then<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.650> did<00:06:20.830> just

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
through the oil and then it did just

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.400 
through the oil and then it did just
boom<00:06:21.970> it<00:06:22.509> was<00:06:22.740> was<00:06:23.740> it<00:06:23.889> was<00:06:23.949> really<00:06:24.250> cool

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.930 

okay<00:06:30.100> I'm<00:06:30.220> going<00:06:30.340> to<00:06:30.400> take<00:06:30.580> away<00:06:30.790> any

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
okay I'm going to take away any

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:39.460 
okay I'm going to take away any
flammable<00:06:31.480> things<00:06:31.630> here

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.689 

that's<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:40.620> tutorial<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.310> don't<00:06:41.490> want<00:06:41.610> that

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
that's the tutorial I don't want that

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:50.380 
that's the tutorial I don't want that
getting<00:06:41.970> burned<00:06:42.150> up<00:06:43.580> okey-dokey

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:07:01.850 

[Applause]

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.899 

that's<00:07:02.860> kind<00:07:03.099> of<00:07:03.159> thing<00:07:03.310> I<00:07:03.370> get<00:07:03.520> in<00:07:03.610> trouble

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
that's kind of thing I get in trouble

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.790 
that's kind of thing I get in trouble
for<00:07:06.270> I've<00:07:07.270> been

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
for I've been

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.189 
for I've been
teaching<00:07:09.520> in<00:07:09.639> theater<00:07:10.000> beep<00:07:10.240> hood<00:07:10.599> for<00:07:11.050> about

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
teaching in theater beep hood for about

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.680 
teaching in theater beep hood for about
six<00:07:11.470> years<00:07:11.530> the<00:07:12.430> carpets<00:07:12.849> all<00:07:12.970> burned<00:07:13.240> up<00:07:13.419> here

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
six years the carpets all burned up here

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:19.140 
six years the carpets all burned up here
this<00:07:13.900> big<00:07:14.080> hole<00:07:14.259> over<00:07:14.500> here<00:07:17.789> so<00:07:18.789> those<00:07:19.030> are

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
this big hole over here so those are

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.580 
this big hole over here so those are
pretty<00:07:19.270> reactive<00:07:19.539> things<00:07:20.110> as<00:07:20.650> you<00:07:21.190> can<00:07:21.370> see
