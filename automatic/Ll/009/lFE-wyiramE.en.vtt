 get practiced on the weekend especially 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.110
 international matches were played against lierse 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.910

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.460
 Belgium and NAC plays without perissia 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.680

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.630
 the road tighadouini and hi 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.770
 are all for different reasons 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 slight aches and pains 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.039
 international obligations 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.300
 and yet still took a halves 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.410
 on the bone in order to King's not here 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.629
 belongs one 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.620
 and he shoots into the side net and takes care of it 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.440
 for the first danger the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.850
 competitions look how excited 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.120
 the defenders of lierse sk already 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.859
 because of that one chance 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.289
 chassis goalkeeper gets the full layer 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.539
 there and nac 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.949
 meanwhile , continue playing well with and 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.620

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.359
 basic and there the anal it is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.409
 occasional striker mats seuntjes that 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:01:00.530
 does not score really well from defense 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.989
 natural and to lucy 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.729
 the cross badly defends the keeper 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.680

 lierse sk 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.190
 got a chance as once in a while 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 this free kick almost to mourn 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.250
 surprised by the effort of the achmed's ai 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 at 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 but again the ball into the net to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.660
 has been experimented a lot and 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 tried by both teams there 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.780

 official midfielder but he can too 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.140

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.120
 Kingsley board and he needs it alone 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.480

 lots of help here today nac 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.640
 absolutely not in the strongest 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.260
 formation makes mince from the Belgians who 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.420

 ball of this vinny vermeer 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.269

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.299
 goalkeeper and he sets the final score at 6 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.030
