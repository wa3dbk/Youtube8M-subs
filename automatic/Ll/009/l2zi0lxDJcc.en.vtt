00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.609 
want to like just let my Landers die for
no<00:01:20.040> reason<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> stood<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.820> heat<00:01:21.090> rent

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
no reason so I stood up to my heat rent

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.960 
no reason so I stood up to my heat rent
he<00:01:22.619> probably<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.189> easily<00:01:23.400> predicted

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
he probably could have easily predicted

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.310 
he probably could have easily predicted
that<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.270> through<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> earthquake<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.170> at

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that down through the earthquake but at

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.660 
that down through the earthquake but at
this<00:01:25.409> point<00:01:25.680> I'm<00:01:25.920> thinking<00:01:25.979> he's<00:01:26.400> scarf

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
this point I'm thinking he's scarf

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
this point I'm thinking he's scarf
because<00:01:26.909> he<00:01:27.000> won't<00:01:27.060> phrase<00:01:27.240> fierce<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
because he won't phrase fierce again and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
because he won't phrase fierce again and
that<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> problem<00:01:29.670> man<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.240> why

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that this is the problem man this is why

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
that this is the problem man this is why
you<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.570> battle<00:01:30.840> Joey<00:01:31.140> wall<00:01:31.470> speaking<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

which<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.150> why<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.770> switched<00:02:14.770> out<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.760> it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
which is why I switched out but it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.800 
which is why I switched out but it
actually<00:02:16.000> actually<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.540> went<00:02:16.600> for<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
actually actually just went for the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.180 
actually actually just went for the
rabbits<00:02:17.110> bin<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.650> figured<00:02:17.980> he<00:02:18.040> wouldn't

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
rabbits bin and I figured he wouldn't

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.309 
rabbits bin and I figured he wouldn't
attack<00:02:18.400> my<00:02:18.580> Landers<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.900> went<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
attack my Landers so I went for the

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.620 
attack my Landers so I went for the
stealth<00:02:20.500> rocks<00:02:20.770> again<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.520> he<00:02:22.270> brings<00:02:22.480> out

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
stealth rocks again and he brings out

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.660 
stealth rocks again and he brings out
his<00:02:22.870> Landorus<00:02:23.350> because<00:02:23.830> he<00:02:24.190> predicted<00:02:24.550> my

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
his Landorus because he predicted my

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.430 
his Landorus because he predicted my
earthquake<00:02:25.030> as<00:02:25.240> he<00:02:25.600> had<00:02:25.750> his<00:02:25.990> aura<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:26.290> Way

still didn't notice that he wasn't scarf
and<00:02:32.820> that's<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:33.940> stupid<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.240> my<00:02:34.330> part<00:02:34.360> but

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
and that's just stupid on my part but

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.120 
and that's just stupid on my part but
here<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.959> went<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.380> Fire<00:02:35.530> Blast

he lived with 7 HP I thought I'd be able
to<00:02:38.560> kill<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.910> he<00:02:40.030> lives<00:02:40.209> with<00:02:40.420> 1<00:02:40.600> HP

to kill I think he lives with 1 HP

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.510 
to kill I think he lives with 1 HP
regardless<00:02:41.350> though<00:02:41.440> he<00:02:41.530> told<00:02:41.739> me<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:41.980> he<00:02:42.340> did

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
regardless though he told me like he did

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.220 
regardless though he told me like he did
some<00:02:42.640> cows<00:02:42.819> or<00:02:43.030> whatever<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.630> whatever<00:02:43.780> and

some cows or whatever but whatever and
he<00:02:44.350> was<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.950> messed<00:02:45.340> up<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:45.730> he's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
he was here I messed up because he's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.960 
he was here I messed up because he's
faster<00:02:46.660> than<00:02:46.690> me<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.140> he<00:02:47.260> uses<00:02:47.500> api's<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.610> I

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
faster than me and he uses api's and I I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.699 
faster than me and he uses api's and I I

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.060 
was thinking he was scarred like I said
before<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.140> was<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.620> really<00:02:53.830> bad

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
before and it it was just a really bad
