00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 two tigipko 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.730
 usually when it comes to 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.740
 do some specialty data 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.810
 about market growth 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.990
 total defeat is obtained as if 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.330
 bad no it will work 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.439
 recall what you can do in this case 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.439
 did everything work out just fine 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.199
 total payables and even 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.550
 hard to catch up 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.460
 slightly different apartment or otherwise 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 all the same radio 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.860
 and there is a wonderful phenomenon just very 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 aerial and germany if a hint of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.550
 braking form of competition 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.680
 decline by 1 7 if you look 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.630
 on the list of options and generally as one 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 a machine 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.740
 as it became known that this is how 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.920
 shows correctness 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 actions in which time tested 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.580
 so let's at the same time lawyer anna 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 Stavitskaya 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.540
 and other pleasant emotions that are now 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 it turned out that the task you think 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.520
 each person 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 guys burn out 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.730
 in the updated map also appeared 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.149
 in every way e-customs 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.520
 type of tracking system for markup 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.060
 delegation of cruise control which 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.020
 the truth always nevertheless decided not to 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.730
 However, the fact that there is work sounds very 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.880
 peter 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.430
 how important is it 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.210
 I understand how much they spent in February 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.189
 subsections specifically for 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.820
 Russian market where nothing like 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.020
 sale 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 the truth will still have something 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.820
 the fact is that the company accepted 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.930
 decision what 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.350
 natural environment held 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.610
 Pyongyang year 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.890
 too good to change 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.520
 so now they are innovating 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.290
 opel astra models and so on 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.050
 don't think about his turnover 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.790
 could also be updated 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.390
 and this is completely in vain 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.569
 controls many functions awkward 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.540
 they hammered the buttons the first time knocks down 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.139
 confused 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.309
 the fact is that any system messenger a 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.209
 childhood itself, I believe that man 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.939
 will manage the phone 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.900
 that is, he doesn't need to do is concerned 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.229
 push customs 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 accordingly, he does not need to look where 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.779
 she is alive 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.719
 joystick control done well but here 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.679
 the remaining owners are not very 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.369
 usually governing body do 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.949
 different forms so that you can distinguish 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.879
 their registration but here such here 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:38.710
 quantity 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.690
 what to do it from the stands just 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.599
 is impossible 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.689
 especially since cats are absolutely the same 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.079
 I can not determine the day is exactly 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.209
 but the congregation is an idea controlled by radio 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.650
 another one of possibly april central 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.079
 on-board computer 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.079
 for the sake of which layer got altogether forgotten 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.520
 it is better 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.980
 and no good moments here, too 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.949
 enough 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.289
 in the car, for example, very well done 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.549
 backlight pens and panels in the evening it 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 looks especially not 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.629
 all materials are enough 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.500
 qualitative 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.500
 there is no feeling of cheap plastic 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.899
 even inserts imitating embossed 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.649
 aluminum looks very natural 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.019
 only decorate the most 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.989
 you can not keep silent and clearance on the display 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.019
 which although there are claims see all 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.609
 equally passed with clear 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.609
 but their class competitors 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.359
 but the place for rear riders is not so 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:40.809
 lot 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.809
 quite understandable eparchy elegant card 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.879
 but the most important thing is not that electronics 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.879
 how is the car 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.999
 but the thrill of driving the opera itself 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.790
 great run for an accident 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.790
 generalists 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.399
 I even then when something that objects 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.279
 that allow you to make a budget 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.329
 sedan special for third countries and 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.679
 emerging markets 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.519
 she is very good road suspension 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.649
 comfortable 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:13.979
 but on irregularities on 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.739
 according to the publication suspension overtake 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.009
 about the same as others 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.979
 team training created triggering 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.159
 areas 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.059
 suspension settings on a sedan shorter 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:25.219
 the trade-off between sport and comfort 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.909
 in favor of the latter 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.229
 Born March 13, 1940 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.849
 in new orleans 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.520
 Buyers are offered a choice of three 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.360
 options 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.539
 bases to the atmosphere 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.259
 above 115 72 turbo engine 1 4 and 1 6 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:42.659
 the richest inhabitant promises arshavin 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:43.630
 four clubs 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.160
 I was very afraid of what keeps because it 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.350
 do one and a half two percent after 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.499
 what is not 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.859
 we know it the car accelerates so 

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:53.959
 say that the text and here is the rest of the place on 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.909
 place elephant certification 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.710
 I exercise today 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.840
 in ten seconds 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.750
 one day result but at speed 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.839
 accelerates a year 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.149
 promise more and improvements 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.889
 economy 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.069
 I'm certainly always glad that happened in the area 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.099
 seven and a half 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.089
 and here is the Ukrainian brand 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:11.210
 Volkswagen system 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.979
 modifying somali behavior 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.539
 at the same time proceeds from the sale of undermining 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.770
 controlled 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.259
 and it's not even regulated 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.620
 which shock absorbers change 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.910
 this is more than adequate in April 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.819
 to react 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.169
 I don't think the car is getting faster 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.900
 psychological effect 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.690
 plus instrument lighting changes the essence 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.169
 white house 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.169
 CEO of the company 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 even after senior lawyer isaev 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.310
 as a gift for this genre 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.310
 for the year are scheduled 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.770
 to save here there is a special 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.480
 club mode 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.080
 whether the gas pedal is the 20th most 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.900
 possibility in sharp accelerations 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.379
 for samara track 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.709
 on the eve of my will I would for me convenient 

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:05.379
 bribe 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:06.599
 two days before 2 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.749
 in respect of them elected loans 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.749
 this is hardly possible edition 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.460
 on the highway consumption fell to five and a half 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.809
 liters per 100 km 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.580
 not bad 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.349
 of course nice looks 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.770
 swift silhouette expensive little versions 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.270
 darkened rear 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.270
 the essence of the idea for what to catch your eyes 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.229
 this is probably the only sedan 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.080
 a design fee which is not at all 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.779
 see 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.119
 I believe that you could work under the protection
