00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.970
 very good morning from today we are 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.730
 gathered to see the logistics that it has 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.730
 well present them savior cheek 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.610
 safely and with paint 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.619
 so great scenery in the coastal area 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.140
 from kid's boardwalk to san lucas by 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.560
 the first time the pilots the gold I 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 they deserve 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.530
 The lock is carrying the order of 20 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 official to the event and we come to reinforce 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 everything for the sake of having an event 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.500
 well organized an event with very good 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.640
 show but especially an event 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640
 safe and with white balance 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.050
 you 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 and I go with everything 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 Y 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.170
 and it 's a career that lends itself to many 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.540
 things will be a lot of people have 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.030
 traffic that will touch us in the second 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.030
 turn is a career a lot of strategy 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.789
 I think class 16 is going to be the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.460
 faster categories with option to 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.250
 achievement 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.260
 if we have them crossing the first 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.869
 turn ahead they come to be vain 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.780
 attacking by the side but villagómez 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.509
 and this is a very difficult race 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 fortunately we get a point with 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.110
 some pressure there from good boy friend 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.030
 villagómez but we manage to get ahead 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
 thank God we started well but with 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.489
 the maña the pp always take us out in the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.230
 curves 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.850
 It is a challenge to bring the years forward 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 They have a lot of experience and we try 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.170
 always to keep watching them learning 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.350
 them something always class one is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.760
 appearing in San Jose forward 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.650
 wilco with the report who are 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.070
 arriving in this category class 1 san 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070
 joseph cape 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.750
 the low tb action team we 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.909
 reinforces that they force joseph of the cape has 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.829
 past 100 109 117 returned the 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.590
 ads needed in this season 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.420
 Luis Mark and the entire team of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.420
 hammer did an excellent job 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.710
 Well, the truth is that it is unpredictable 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.780
 knowing the quality of the runners 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.780
 anything we can expect
