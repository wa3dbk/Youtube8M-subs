windstar<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.230> looked<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> was

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
windstar like it looked like it was

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.660 
windstar like it looked like it was
between<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> years<00:00:38.700> 99<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:40.710> 2003<00:00:41.640> or

between the years 99 to 2003 or

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
between the years 99 to 2003 or
something<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
something I think that was the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.799 
something I think that was the
generation<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.309> parked<00:00:44.940> very<00:00:45.420> poorly

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
generation and it was parked very poorly

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.889 
generation and it was parked very poorly
very<00:00:46.710> poorly<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.940> crooked<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
very poorly like it was crooked in the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.040 
very poorly like it was crooked in the
spot<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.129> come<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.670> bumper<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.329> I

little<00:00:59.640> scrape<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.840> little

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
little scrape right there a little

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
little scrape right there a little
scrape<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.180> nice<00:01:03.480> indent

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because they were on the right side
