anything<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.730> because<00:03:40.060> they<00:03:40.299> look<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.750> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
anything just because they look like the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.509 
anything just because they look like the
characters<00:03:41.440> from<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.739> show<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.280> kid's

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
going to respond to that a lot better

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.100 
going to respond to that a lot better
than<00:03:45.030> something<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.299> would<00:03:46.510> look<00:03:46.660> nothing

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
than something that would look nothing

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.569 
than something that would look nothing
like<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.410> character<00:03:47.769> from<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.070> show<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.459> this
