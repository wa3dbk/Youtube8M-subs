00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.110
 during the last weekend game and finally to attack his neighbors this 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.469
 week it's a whole different story of doping also started again at 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.530
 the singing star academy songs will surely 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.000
 on stage it's dancing here I guess it'll get better with time 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.130
 but as the 32 year olds this season start something 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 I loved turning all the scenes 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.059
 the most difficult for me is to leave my character to the world and 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.059
 especially not know what the people are fighting 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's still a lot of love 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 and I loved him a lot 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.530
 by necessarily private 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.830
 in any case in public 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.800
 we do cinema I think that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.790
 I'm not going back 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 I think we can imagine 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.410
 without that I will advance of humanity that it was about m 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.650
 but this mistake 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 but I'm proud of what I did I was born 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.190
 u17 that made me laugh the most I laughed a lot dances songs and dances 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.259
 of the group 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 it's a big problem because 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.329
 I searched for myself 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.820
 in general buyers 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.330
 his deputy director of the other 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.180
 and the means of the actor clients 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.790
 played him in writing how good is it 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.150
 evade the whole team of street sons and daughters 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.730
 I check if I finished 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.070
 who wants to protect 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.900
 this conflict is 12th net at 6am and 7am lay the game 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
 everyone needs to 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.510
 philippe juvin with a world record amount 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 you missed 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 and so to pay all this time I have all the time that the EU 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 you can not know as if tormented he has a text that he wrote 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.480
 in ruby 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 he is able to tell you my cell 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.469
 piss of laughter 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.159
 and mickael 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 as you want messages 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.019
 they will have it 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.979
 then stops 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.979
 he judges that I was going to hit 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.389
 almost all the scenes are all three together 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.599
 it was hell 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.969
 it was enough that tell him good 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.159
 he said my grandfather I liked it's missed they spent the sponge 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.139
 he came to read 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.619
 In the coming months 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.619
 what number politics decided to throw away the sponge 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.139
 the 2010 promoters being thrown out the sponge but hey I think you want 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.049
 I cut you out the space is quite easily 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.049
 lucas 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:56.619
 well 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.109
 so far they have managed to raise donations via the internet 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.419
 I see another meaning we do not know if it's so bad to pass to throw 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.010
 the sponge 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.399
 he has to throw away the sponge 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.019
 and after it was over 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.009
 in the car to say it 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.139
 I passed I was to see 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.139
 here I have a proposal at the office 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.639
 moreover, there are three options 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.229
 other survivors 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.599
 that's what made you laugh 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.219
 if I am here the rubble 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.149

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.479
 and when I laugh 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.179
 I will tell you an anecdote right away 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.419

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:01.749
 That day

 the ssla cameras m 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.219

 it does not matter he emits the key to this world 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.419
 when we are in the blur 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.840
 in a crazy world 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.710

 they open their eyes wide 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.039
 I ask on arrival 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.629

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.629

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.229
 I rarely see if I see that before 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.229
 I see in my eyes I see what happens inside the acts 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.569
 I could not fight and I see will die hot with wings 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.840
 and the fortiguard labs generated 3 l to Algerians 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.089

 Alexander The Great 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.830
 3 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.139
 if she is elected 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.080

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.129

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.449
 that had already made us the car trip that lasts 12 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.359
 9 o'clock this weekend in the car who are called to the biggest race 

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:31.599

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.599
 for two days 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.400
 it ensures not to be easy we will see 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.779
 the report to April 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.629
 it seems that he would clean the object for having built the roma that had 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.189
 place 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.189
 and that's wonderful memories last 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.800
 it's my role 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 extremely difficult for a director 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.759
 at that moment I do not know if I will succeed to find such a desire 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.819
 the scene of the garonne so when along the station platform that dare nothing 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.680
 say but I have not eaten google china it's true I especially want to talk 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.159
 safari all the busy made noise 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.159
 the price to pay 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.699
 this scene thanks to hernandez 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.150
 to reach 45 countries 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.680
 because in fact he could not stand it any more I could not 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.120
 Massive audience with hindsight I would have preferred it to stop there 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.330
 but 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.330
 when you have a community 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.240
 two o'clock 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.930

 you want to have talks 

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:40.259
 It is what it is 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.729
 this city 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.729
 it's hard to say 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.509
 before answering his little sentence
