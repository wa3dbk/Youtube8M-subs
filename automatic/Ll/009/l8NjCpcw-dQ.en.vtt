00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
one in the past but this one tends to be

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200 
one in the past but this one tends to be
very<00:01:03.570> much<00:01:04.320> comfortable<00:01:04.739> i<00:01:04.890> will<00:01:05.220> say<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
very much comfortable i will say that so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.340 
very much comfortable i will say that so
this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.540> basically<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.320> looks

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this is basically what the back looks

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.200 
this is basically what the back looks
like<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.090> these

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
like and then they just have these

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
like and then they just have these
little<00:01:09.360> button<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.799> i<00:01:10.920> believe<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
little button up here and i believe it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
little button up here and i believe it
is<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> one-size-fits-all<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is like a one-size-fits-all because it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
is like a one-size-fits-all because it
goes<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.580> lacing<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> back<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.960> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
goes by the lacing in the back so if you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.380 
goes by the lacing in the back so if you
need<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.979> room<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
need a little bit more room you can you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
need a little bit more room you can you
know<00:01:18.509> loosen<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> could<00:01:19.470> tie<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
know loosen it or you could tie in the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
know loosen it or you could tie in the
idea<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.220> drew<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> string<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.299> bit

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
idea just drew to string a little bit

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.850 
idea just drew to string a little bit
and<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.630> hide<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.470> good<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.710> go
