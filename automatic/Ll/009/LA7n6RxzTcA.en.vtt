 of the best and welcome are all 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.810
 we have a new minecraft video in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.430
 the one that brought them a command that we 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.170
 add several things that are going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 work enough for our homes or 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.770
 for our equations or for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 a lot of very interesting things that 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.730
 brings us this command and also to epics 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.950
 gentlemen that are called moll utilities that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 would be more utilities then appreciation 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.730
 rather than aggravate command since 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.170
 there are things that mean they come here that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.329
 nor on motorcycles comes then it is very 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 beautiful and good then of known we go 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.170
 to see if it is possible to arrive at 1600 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.239
 likes in this video since all videos 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.890
 we have broken the challenges and then it gives me 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.329
 quite joy to see that all your support 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 is always there, gentlemen, the truth is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.949
 inside video and saw the support gives me 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 a lot of joy and step and more I saw 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.280
 until 10 and it's been for rap and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.219
 then well then with nothing more than 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 say let's start the review then 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 2 good blog do is take what 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 eat two eat and we will all know and go 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.330
 that what commands then can not get 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.620
 here in the inventory obviously what 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.210
 we have to get out of the chat 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.100
 then they met cyberspace 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.620
 at p 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.650
 I'm silly this week in kraft two 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.880
 points 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.200
 This way we block 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.660
 commands in your inventory and we have it 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.190
 to put any place of preference 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.050
 in a place with space for a race 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.330
 of this tree because then base akrón 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.190
 makes a giant machine and if we do it 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.080
 without space as it can interfere and go out 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.790
 bad pieces good now let's go to the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.050
 description to the command that left you a 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.480
 description and they will copy it from the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.370
 diagonal to where is this these 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.450
 as already visitors select it before the 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.940
 right copied well in which the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.380
 control console vy cling the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 command automatically as you can see 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.580
 here we have all what you command all 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.440
 we would do with any redstone block 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.729
 and then here is the machine that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.990
 spoke then if we had put it 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 to jobs I would have worked with the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.180
 trees and then nothing would have come out 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.650
 good good this command is from mister 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.780
 upper garretón this description 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.060
 evidently so that in your work and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 well then what are we going to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.150
 do are several characters to redeem 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.709
 complying have not been a month since 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.570
 character or else pull and tense the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.190
 I mean, what are you talking about right now? 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.680
 that I mean then the first site 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.150
 is created with crystals of these prism 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.819
 of priest marine or something 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 if really espanyol those crystals 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.849
 but good if with sticks then that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.260
 we have these two we throw to the ground 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.519
 as I tell you to raise and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.099
 it automatically came out in the first 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.019
 character that is repellent museums 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.900
 is that this is out of the ordinary 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.579
 let's say and we have to have them 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.560
 good dogwood dayz it is logical that 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.540
 find we put the mod repellent 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 will move all modes that are 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 close as you can see you can not 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.030
 zoom in if we put them iphone we're going 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.739
 to fly then well enough 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.359
 especially for when, well, if you want 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.310
 a safe area that there is no box 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.010
 close can be repellent of mods the va 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.129
 to automatically move away from slipping 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.569
 then this fun is not good anymore 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.099
 we can take it away with just one hit 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.689
 and it automatically returns us 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.069
 our reference both to move it to 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.959
 another place and good to see, too 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.430
 have a good one not be a good one 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.109
 animation is nice 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.090
 Now the next one is the next 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.250
 blessed with an iron block and with 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.069
 an area with one of these with week 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.569
 compile vila vila min this an anvil 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.489
 then we throw them to social equally 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.160
 and automatically he has to give us another 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.440
 little egg and this nice one is the box 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.430
 we can make ice with water that is 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.070
 we need iron bars and bars 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.840
 iron and we put them three up or three 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.360
 down and in the center a bucket of water 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.790
 we wait for so long and is super 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.290
 machine but and epic is going to create this 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.270
 ice automatically as you can see 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.040
 We hope and ice if we stayed 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.960
 we hope a little more is going to create 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.910
 ice but the country's the other kind of 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.190
 ice that is this the package here is 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350
 for what country then there is mourning and many 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.090
 musical and well we can do 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.130
 this process as many times as we want to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.070
 have infinite ice now what 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.770
 we have now is the witch veron tractor 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.240
 they are this door and with gunpowder 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.340
 then we throw Atlantic around the 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.770
 floor and so the fretting is going to give us another 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.750
 huevito and then it is the smoke detector 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.210
 I liked it a lot because this is 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.920
 for buildings or for houses is 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.720
 pretty good we can not put the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.730
 smoke detector on ceilings if we put it 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.230
 on one side then to disappear or 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.150
 anything when style then to 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.489
 disappear does not have to be a roof and 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.190
 if we put any fire close by 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.690
 nine blocks I think not 16 blocks if there 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.690
 fire nearby because the alarm will sound 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 then we will know if you design our 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.050
 bathroom 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.150
 what is doing good, we can already 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.250
 remove the detector with a blow 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.500
 of smoke and finally we have the last 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.600
 item that is with a step of these from 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.750
 stone and also with what would be a 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.730
 compact shares comparate shares the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.860
 oven I am your well-known but good the 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.720
 point is that we change we have the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.150
 huevito and this is an emotion detector 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.650
 this mode work but a lot at 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.090
 to light up our homes to 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.300
 Numbering 6 is if I have no idea 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.890
 illumination 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.900
 well we put it and as you can see then 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.150
 it's like they spin around if we 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.040
 we grab redstone and then a lamp 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.730
 we activate good we can do this not what 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.200
 what am I doing good 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.700
 I put here and here a lamp then 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.070
 the lamp is obviously on 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.380
 if we go away it goes out that wants 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.970
 say that we can have automatic light 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.730
 with we enter the kitchen with let's 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.350
 get to learn automatically or in 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.390
 the bathroom you get to the bathroom and you approach and you 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.510
 turn on a signal of the rest that put in 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.590
 of lamps 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.740
 obviously then for this I 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.140
 the emotion detector works and then 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.630
 is very good is a system with many 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.010
 lights with many things and it 's enough 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.720
 peak when you are in that turn on 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.330
 the lights do not by in this peak 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.760
 because I think it's very beautiful then 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.080
 good gentlemen when navas what to say 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.750
 about this as I admit branches are four 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.250
 items that add us utilities with a 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.140
 simple command without any evil 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.640
 so good if you are forget 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.980
 in his life ham I like it front not 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.330
