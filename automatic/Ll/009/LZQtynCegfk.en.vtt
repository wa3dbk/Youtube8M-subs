00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
 well these come to a new video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.240
 good new video comparison 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 graphics between playstation 4 and virtual x 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 I know you like this kind of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
 videos I do not know if because or cool and listen 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.209
 between your text something like that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.860
 but hey, it seemed quite interesting 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.390
 that we also see a little the logo ni 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.550
 for speed next generation rivals 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.720
 you have it in the description of the video in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.030
 you only have to open the description 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 and there you will have the video and pass them to 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.190
 see him while I speak a little and good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.530
 a rather odd comparison 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.480
 done not because basically they are not the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.430
 same areas that are showing in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 a gameplay that we often do 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.500
 that it is true that you can buy a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 little certain things I really 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 I do not notice much difference really not 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.350
 I play the pse better which one looks worse I see it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 both the same and the truth a little 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 disappointment not on graphic themes of this 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 new nor forspeed for the next 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.850
 generation is also going to come out 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.129
 for this but for the next I suppose 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.900
 that it will be that we have a strong point 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.269
 a bit of disappointment basically because 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.280
 we compare them with games that go to 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.000
 have of exits lending pressure 4 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 like x not the field is a little scratch the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.410
 inequality we can pretty much put a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.660
 example how force the new force for 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.430
 team one and we can also put in the 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.759
 example of drive clear how good it is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.380
 is going to delay a little I think and the truth 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.050
 that we compare the other games with this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.509
 and it does not stay a little at the height of 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.130
 bitumen yes that is true as I say for me 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.960
 graphics are no longer important 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.450
 next generation are not going to be is not 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.160
 a is not a thing that says I'm not going 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.590
 to buy because it has bad graphics already 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.259
 I think the good standard already 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.140
 we have spent with this generation and already 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.909
 the lower standards of the next 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.979
 policy will not bother anyone not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.880
 as long as the things that are 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.969
 they have to see 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.070
 for there is any problem the 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.689
 true, surely, this is not what I 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.360
 I bought because I really like the style 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.610
 burnout that you put some or for 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.470
 speed and for me burn audio is one of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.479
 best driving sagas and of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.759
 destruction of course he has done 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.319
 criterion and I would very much like it 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.840
 return to again make do 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.420
 a new oven because it would be the dick not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.370
 has the past and I would love it very much 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 very much very much to see one again but 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 well this maybe the closest thing that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.790
 we're going to have no so good nothing else 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.989
 kids this has been everything I leave you the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.610
 video of the graphic comparison the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.410
 description and nothing to discuss here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.340
 our little things and we swim in the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.340
 next video is next
