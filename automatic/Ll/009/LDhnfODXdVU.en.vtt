certainly not going to pretend to know

certainly not going to pretend to know
much<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.640> 3d<00:00:18.449> printers<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.890> my

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
much about 3d printers but it's my

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.580 
much about 3d printers but it's my
understanding<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.240> bronze<00:00:21.590> filament

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
understanding that the bronze filament

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.970 
understanding that the bronze filament
has<00:00:23.539> metallic<00:00:24.539> particles<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
has metallic particles in with the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.429 
has metallic particles in with the
plastic<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.150> does<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.109> much

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
plastic and it does make for a much

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.209 
plastic and it does make for a much
heavier<00:00:29.390> object<00:00:30.650> today<00:00:31.650> we're<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> be

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
heavier object today we're going to be

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.360 
heavier object today we're going to be
focusing<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.570> teardrop<00:00:34.410> shaped<00:00:34.829> round

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
focusing on this teardrop shaped round

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.560 
focusing on this teardrop shaped round
the<00:00:35.640> other<00:00:35.790> rounds<00:00:36.090> we're<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> shoot

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the other rounds we're going to shoot

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.100 
the other rounds we're going to shoot
later<00:00:37.550> but<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.180> teardrop<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.899> such

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
later but because this teardrop is such

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.639 
later but because this teardrop is such
a<00:00:40.290> odd<00:00:40.710> shape<00:00:41.340> you'd<00:00:42.180> never<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.570> able<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> get

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
a odd shape you'd never be able to get

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
a odd shape you'd never be able to get
very<00:00:43.920> good<00:00:43.980> support<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> shell<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.149> he

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
very good support in the shell so he

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
very good support in the shell so he
created<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> holder<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
created this kind of a holder for it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.160 
created this kind of a holder for it
which<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> also<00:00:48.450> 3d<00:00:49.410> printed<00:00:50.809> now<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> weight

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
which is also 3d printed now the weight

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.189 
which is also 3d printed now the weight
of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> combined<00:00:53.160> holder<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> teardrop

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of the combined holder and the teardrop

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.639 
of the combined holder and the teardrop
round<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:56.640> half<00:00:57.030> an<00:00:57.180> ounce<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
round is about half an ounce which is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.540 
round is about half an ounce which is
about<00:00:58.890> 16<00:00:59.520> grams<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.949> weight<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
about 16 grams and the weight of the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.359 
about 16 grams and the weight of the
teardrop<00:01:03.270> round<00:01:03.809> itself<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.500> 12<00:01:04.979> grams<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
teardrop round itself is 12 grams and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.890 
teardrop round itself is 12 grams and
because<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> coloring<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.360> round<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because of the coloring of this round I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
because of the coloring of this round I
had<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.710> markings<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.729> wasn't

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
had to put some markings on it I wasn't

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
had to put some markings on it I wasn't
sure<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.750> silver<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.380> show<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.770> better<00:01:13.979> or

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
sure if silver would show up better or

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.050 
sure if silver would show up better or
black<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> I'd<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.689> both<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.520> that's<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.790> we

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
black so I'd use both and that's so we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
black so I'd use both and that's so we
can<00:01:18.240> maybe<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> better<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
can maybe see it better with the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.690 
can maybe see it better with the
high-speed<00:01:20.520> cameras<00:01:21.259> because<00:01:22.259> Brown<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.490> not

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
high-speed cameras because Brown is not

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
high-speed cameras because Brown is not
going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:24.600> against<00:01:25.170> brown

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
going to show up very well against brown

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.690 
going to show up very well against brown
sand<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> round<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.439> doesn't<00:01:28.950> lock<00:01:29.430> very

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sand the round really doesn't lock very

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
sand the round really doesn't lock very
tightly<00:01:30.060> into<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.079> guess<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> call<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
tightly into this I guess you call it a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.179 
tightly into this I guess you call it a
Sabo<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.409> when<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> shoot<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> supposed

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
Sabo and when you shoot it it's supposed

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.539 
Sabo and when you shoot it it's supposed
to<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.600> separate<00:01:37.590> from<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.009> black

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to you know separate from that black

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
to you know separate from that black
Sabo<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.900> round<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.290> fly<00:01:40.560> by<00:01:40.740> itself

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
Sabo and the round will fly by itself

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.389 
Sabo and the round will fly by itself
but<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> saw<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.899> my<00:01:42.930> titling<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
but as you saw in my titling this is a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
but as you saw in my titling this is a
failure<00:01:44.790> analysis<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.509> we're<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> try

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
failure analysis so we're going to try

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.330 
failure analysis so we're going to try
to<00:01:46.020> figure<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.590> went<00:01:46.740> wrong<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to figure out what went wrong with this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
to figure out what went wrong with this
round<00:01:47.579> another<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.930> wanted<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> test

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
round another thing we wanted to test

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.850 
round another thing we wanted to test
was<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> light<00:01:50.670> blue<00:01:50.939> background<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:52.590> gives

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
was a light blue background this gives

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.700 
was a light blue background this gives
us<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> solid<00:01:53.579> color<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.659> too<00:01:54.689> bright<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> not

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
us a solid color not too bright and not

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.760 
us a solid color not too bright and not
too<00:01:55.890> dark<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:57.090> contrast<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> rounds<00:01:58.469> against

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
too dark to contrast the rounds against

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889 
too dark to contrast the rounds against
as<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.219> fly<00:01:59.399> through<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> air<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
as they fly through the air and the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
as they fly through the air and the
reason<00:02:01.229> Daren<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.829> holding<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> gun<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.549> such

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
reason Daren is holding the gun in such

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.139 
reason Daren is holding the gun in such
a<00:02:02.759> weird<00:02:03.060> way<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.500> shoulders<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.640> arms

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
a weird way is so is shoulders and arms

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.790 
a weird way is so is shoulders and arms
don't<00:02:06.780> block<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> camera<00:02:07.590> view<00:02:07.770> ready

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.780 

huh<00:02:13.800> went<00:02:14.370> through<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.760> yeah<00:02:19.040> even<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.310> 300

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
huh went through it yeah even at 300

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.180 
huh went through it yeah even at 300
frames<00:02:21.120> per<00:02:21.420> second<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.410> see<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
frames per second you can see that the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.830 
frames per second you can see that the
save<00:02:23.580> oh<00:02:23.760> did<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.060> separate<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
save oh did not separate from the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.710 
save oh did not separate from the
teardrop<00:02:25.460> now<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.520> shotgun<00:02:27.030> shell<00:02:27.330> had<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
teardrop now the shotgun shell had a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.170 
teardrop now the shotgun shell had a
reduced<00:02:28.110> powder<00:02:28.470> charge<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:30.150> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
reduced powder charge in it because I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
reduced powder charge in it because I
was<00:02:30.420> worried<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.230> g-shock<00:02:31.800> would<00:02:32.070> just

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
was worried that the g-shock would just

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970 
was worried that the g-shock would just
shatter<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.820> whole<00:02:33.000> assembly<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.870> also<00:02:34.680> wanted

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
shatter the whole assembly I also wanted

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.740 
shatter the whole assembly I also wanted
to<00:02:35.040> keep<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.370> velocity<00:02:36.030> low<00:02:36.240> enough<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:36.570> that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
to keep the velocity low enough so that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.990 
to keep the velocity low enough so that
we<00:02:37.350> could<00:02:37.470> still<00:02:37.800> be<00:02:37.950> able<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.190> observe<00:02:38.640> what

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
we could still be able to observe what

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660 
we could still be able to observe what
was<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.600> with<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.930> round<00:02:40.170> now<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.520> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
was going on with this round now this is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.030 
was going on with this round now this is
600<00:02:42.210> frames<00:02:42.390> per<00:02:42.660> second<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
600 frames per second and we have a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.640 
600 frames per second and we have a
little<00:02:44.460> better<00:02:44.610> detail<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.530> can

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
little better detail there and you can

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
little better detail there and you can
see<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.920> round<00:02:47.130> tumbling<00:02:47.670> off<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> left

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
see the round tumbling off to the left

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.070 
see the round tumbling off to the left
after<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.080> goes<00:02:49.200> through<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.590> plywood<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:51.080> do

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
after it goes through the plywood I do

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.530 
after it goes through the plywood I do
like<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.680> light<00:02:53.070> blue<00:02:53.340> background<00:02:53.670> how<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
like the light blue background how it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.480 
like the light blue background how it
contrasts<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> round<00:02:55.680> against<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
contrasts the round against it

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.830 
contrasts the round against it
that<00:02:56.700> seems<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.970> be<00:02:57.000> working<00:02:57.330> well<00:02:57.360> we'll

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that seems to be working well we'll

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.520 
that seems to be working well we'll
probably<00:02:57.990> use<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.740> other<00:02:59.460> videos<00:02:59.550> as<00:03:00.530> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
probably use that in other videos as you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.850 
probably use that in other videos as you
know<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.860> learn<00:03:02.280> from<00:03:02.520> our<00:03:02.730> mistakes<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.860> we

know we learn from our mistakes and we

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.680 
know we learn from our mistakes and we

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
can't improve unless we know what's

can't improve unless we know what's
wrong<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.610> if<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.820> any<00:03:08.940> ideas<00:03:09.240> why<00:03:09.510> this

doing something wrong anyway and the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.630 
doing something wrong anyway and the
solution<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.020> everything<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.710> either<00:03:22.890> get<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
solution to everything is either get a

solution to everything is either get a
better<00:03:23.850> high<00:03:24.090> speed<00:03:24.390> camera<00:03:24.870> or<00:03:25.140> shoot<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.040> out

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
better high speed camera or shoot it out

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.240 
better high speed camera or shoot it out
of<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.370> rifle<00:03:26.700> barrel<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.530> believe<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
of a rifle barrel and believe me if I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.040 
of a rifle barrel and believe me if I
had<00:03:29.280> better<00:03:29.760> high<00:03:30.090> speed<00:03:30.390> cameras

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
had better high speed cameras

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.230 
had better high speed cameras
I<00:03:31.080> would<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.190> be<00:03:32.340> wasting<00:03:32.670> my<00:03:32.790> time<00:03:32.970> making

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
I would not be wasting my time making

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.690 
I would not be wasting my time making
youtube<00:03:33.630> videos<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.320> I'd<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.830> taking<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
youtube videos with it I'd be taking it

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700 
youtube videos with it I'd be taking it
