the CRJ back to you for next year this
has<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.850> guess<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> 8<00:00:42.660> here

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
has got the I guess where the 8 here

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.360 
has got the I guess where the 8 here
drops<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.800> 180

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
drops down to a 180

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.810 
drops down to a 180
there's<00:00:44.520> also<00:00:44.699> 72<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.260> 64<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.070> what's<00:00:47.670> cool

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
there's also 72 and a 64 and what's cool

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
there's also 72 and a 64 and what's cool
about<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.149> ski<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> brings<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> taper

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
about this ski as it brings the taper

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
about this ski as it brings the taper
the<00:00:49.500> widest<00:00:49.770> part<00:00:49.949> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> ski<00:00:50.370> closer<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the widest part of the ski closer to the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
the widest part of the ski closer to the
boot<00:00:51.120> sole<00:00:51.359> so<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> benefit<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
boot sole so the benefit there is that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.049 
boot sole so the benefit there is that
you're<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> traditional

you're gonna have more of a traditional

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
you're gonna have more of a traditional
ski<00:00:54.660> feel<00:00:54.930> underfoot<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.520> have

ski feel underfoot but you're gonna have

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
ski feel underfoot but you're gonna have
the<00:00:57.059> forgiveness<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.870> versatility<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the forgiveness and versatility of that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
the forgiveness and versatility of that
rocker<00:00:59.399> reverse<00:01:00.090> side<00:01:00.300> cut<00:01:00.570> tip<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.930> tail<00:01:01.109> so
