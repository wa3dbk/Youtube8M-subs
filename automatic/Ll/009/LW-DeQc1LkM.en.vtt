00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
even yeah some toffee tuning it with all

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.260 
even yeah some toffee tuning it with all
the<00:02:06.890> chocolate<00:02:07.490> all<00:02:07.670> right<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:07.969> you<00:02:08.030> know<00:02:08.149> at

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
the chocolate all right and you know at

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.810 
the chocolate all right and you know at
12<00:02:08.570> years<00:02:08.869> certainly<00:02:09.800> getting<00:02:10.070> some<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.700> know

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
12 years certainly getting some you know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.759 
12 years certainly getting some you know
barrel<00:02:11.330> characteristic

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
barrel characteristic

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.449 
barrel characteristic
nice<00:02:13.129> pipe<00:02:13.700> tobacco<00:02:14.030> even<00:02:15.159> yeah<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.310> their

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
nice pipe tobacco even yeah and their

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.910 
nice pipe tobacco even yeah and their
barrel<00:02:16.700> poop<00:02:16.879> I<00:02:17.030> think<00:02:17.209> certainly<00:02:17.720> also

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
barrel poop I think certainly also

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.800 
barrel poop I think certainly also
graces<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.519> amount<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.790> barrel<00:02:20.510> type

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
graces the the amount of barrel type

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.000 
graces the the amount of barrel type
characteristics<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.650> yet

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
characteristics you yet

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.920 
characteristics you yet
sure<00:02:22.370> thing<00:02:22.610> whoa<00:02:22.760> hey<00:02:22.909> that's<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.239> wait<00:02:23.780> no

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
sure thing whoa hey that's a wait no

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.869 
sure thing whoa hey that's a wait no
further<00:02:24.140> take<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.890> few<00:02:25.069> years<00:02:30.579> yeah<00:02:31.579> Jeff

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
further take it a few years yeah Jeff

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.569 
further take it a few years yeah Jeff
the<00:02:32.420> heat<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:33.799> one<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.099> first<00:02:34.280> things<00:02:34.459> I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
the heat is one of the first things I

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.920 
the heat is one of the first things I
noticed<00:02:34.909> on<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> thing<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.480> thing<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.900> uh

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
noticed on this thing this thing is uh

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.530 
noticed on this thing this thing is uh
it's<00:02:36.890> hopping<00:02:37.069> yeah<00:02:37.849> smack<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.269> right<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
it's hopping yeah smack you right in the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.990 
it's hopping yeah smack you right in the
face<00:02:38.720> one<00:02:39.019> 40.2<00:02:39.709> proof<00:02:40.040> there's<00:02:40.640> no<00:02:40.760> hiding

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
face one 40.2 proof there's no hiding

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.559 
face one 40.2 proof there's no hiding
from<00:02:41.209> it

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
from it

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.160 
from it
nope<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.439> also<00:02:42.590> very<00:02:43.450> almost<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.659> syrup

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
nope it's also very almost like a syrup

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.199 
nope it's also very almost like a syrup
in<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> mouthfeel<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.190> very<00:02:46.700> thick<00:02:46.940> very

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
in the mouthfeel is very thick very

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.930 
in the mouthfeel is very thick very
thick<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:49.159> know<00:02:49.690> red<00:02:50.690> hops<00:02:50.930> right<00:02:51.109> up<00:02:51.349> front

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
thick you know red hops right up front

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.360 
thick you know red hops right up front
spicy<00:02:52.940> yes<00:02:53.870> sweet<00:02:54.200> sweet<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.310> spicy<00:02:57.370> cinnamon

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
spicy yes sweet sweet and spicy cinnamon

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.750 
spicy yes sweet sweet and spicy cinnamon
I<00:03:00.940> think<00:03:01.940> there's<00:03:02.690> not<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.900> lot<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.760> sweet

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
I think there's not a lot of sweet

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.520 
I think there's not a lot of sweet
characteristics<00:03:05.629> if<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.930> will<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.139> think<00:03:06.260> the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
characteristics if you will I think the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.710 
characteristics if you will I think the
the<00:03:07.280> proof<00:03:07.609> of<00:03:07.879> it<00:03:08.139> does<00:03:09.139> you<00:03:10.099> know<00:03:10.299> limit<00:03:11.299> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
the proof of it does you know limit the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.000 
the proof of it does you know limit the
sweetness<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.319> little<00:03:12.349> bit<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:12.799> thread

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
sweetness a little bit just thread

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.360 
sweetness a little bit just thread
overall<00:03:13.400> heat<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.349> quite<00:03:16.340> good

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
overall heat of it but it is quite good

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.710 
overall heat of it but it is quite good
you<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.329> also<00:03:18.169> getting<00:03:18.349> some<00:03:18.620> molasses<00:03:19.190> and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
you know also getting some molasses and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.740 
you know also getting some molasses and
similar<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.989> notes<00:03:21.169> and<00:03:21.470> darker<00:03:21.799> fruits<00:03:22.099> I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
similar to the notes and darker fruits I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.960 
similar to the notes and darker fruits I
think<00:03:23.750> Jeff<00:03:24.250> adding<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.310> little<00:03:25.489> bit<00:03:25.669> of<00:03:25.760> water

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
think Jeff adding a little bit of water

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.729 
think Jeff adding a little bit of water
to<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.329> may<00:03:26.720> just<00:03:26.959> open<00:03:27.109> up<00:03:27.379> some<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
to this may just open up some of the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.789 
to this may just open up some of the
flavor<00:03:27.889> you<00:03:28.819> know<00:03:28.940> maybe<00:03:29.780> drop<00:03:30.319> it<00:03:30.440> down<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.769> a

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
flavor you know maybe drop it down to a

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.360 
flavor you know maybe drop it down to a
manageable<00:03:31.069> 130<00:03:31.819> proof<00:03:32.260> yeah<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.290> mean<00:03:33.410> 140s

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
manageable 130 proof yeah I mean 140s

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.339 
manageable 130 proof yeah I mean 140s
it's<00:03:34.760> about<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.419> high<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.959> think<00:03:36.169> I<00:03:36.290> don't

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
it's about the high I think I don't

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.319 
it's about the high I think I don't
think<00:03:36.500> I've<00:03:36.680> had<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.829> bourbon<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.370> very<00:03:38.120> high

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
think I've had a bourbon that very high

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.180 
think I've had a bourbon that very high
unprovable<00:03:38.840> floor<00:03:39.109> right<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> think<00:03:39.709> at<00:03:39.949> some

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
unprovable floor right I think at some

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.689 
unprovable floor right I think at some
point<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.639> know<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.870> alcohol<00:03:42.379> does<00:03:43.010> detract

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
point you know the alcohol does detract

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.449 
point you know the alcohol does detract
from<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.569> taste<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.109> bit<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:46.220> may<00:03:46.400> be

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
from the taste just a bit that may be

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.339 
from the taste just a bit that may be
what's<00:03:46.730> going<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:47.060> here<00:03:47.329> so<00:03:47.569> I'm<00:03:48.079> with<00:03:48.290> a

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
what's going on here so I'm with a

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.830 
what's going on here so I'm with a
little<00:03:48.530> bit<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.739> water<00:03:48.889> I<00:03:49.040> think<00:03:49.430> I'm<00:03:50.359> gonna<00:03:50.660> be

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
little bit of water I think I'm gonna be

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.759 
little bit of water I think I'm gonna be
my<00:03:50.989> recommendation<00:03:55.780> as<00:03:56.780> far<00:03:57.049> as<00:03:57.169> finish

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
my recommendation as far as finish

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.849 
my recommendation as far as finish
finish<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.370> just<00:03:58.669> keeps<00:03:59.540> going<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.290> going<00:04:00.409> and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
finish it just keeps going and going and

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.390 
finish it just keeps going and going and
going

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
going

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.909 
going
yes<00:04:01.699> kind<00:04:02.299> of<00:04:02.329> like<00:04:02.449> a<00:04:02.480> spicy<00:04:02.900> candy<00:04:03.620> almost

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
yes kind of like a spicy candy almost

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.970 
yes kind of like a spicy candy almost
yeah<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:04.970> definitely<00:04:05.180> did<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.780> it's<00:04:06.019> spicy

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
yeah you definitely did it's it's spicy

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.909 
yeah you definitely did it's it's spicy
maybe<00:04:07.760> some<00:04:07.909> like<00:04:08.060> pepper<00:04:08.299> or<00:04:08.540> almost<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.229> think

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
maybe some like pepper or almost I think

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.860 
maybe some like pepper or almost I think
in<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.340> finish<00:04:10.699> a<00:04:10.970> little<00:04:11.299> bit<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.599> tobacco

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
in the finish a little bit of tobacco

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.610 
in the finish a little bit of tobacco
and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
and

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.589 
and
there<00:04:12.769> as<00:04:12.920> well<00:04:13.099> just<00:04:13.400> seems<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.450> linger

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
there as well just seems to linger

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.270 
there as well just seems to linger

yeah<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.229> mean<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.470> think<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:45.979> doesn't<00:04:46.340> get<00:04:46.460> too

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
much better than this and I think with a

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.020 
much better than this and I think with a
few<00:04:48.229> drops<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.770> water<00:04:48.979> if<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.280> really<00:04:49.610> open<00:04:49.910> it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
few drops of water if you really open it

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.490 
few drops of water if you really open it
up<00:04:50.180> I'm<00:04:50.690> gonna<00:04:50.810> have<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.050> give<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.320> power

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
up I'm gonna have to give the power

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.170
