is what you want to do you want to get a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.990 
is what you want to do you want to get a
tool<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> can't<00:00:44.789> come

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
tool like this if you if you can't come

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.729 
tool like this if you if you can't come
across<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:46.230> another<00:00:46.530> way

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
across one of these there's another way

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.400 
across one of these there's another way
to<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.750> taking

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to do it and it's basically just taking

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.490 
to do it and it's basically just taking
a<00:00:49.789> wrench<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.300> fit<00:00:51.510> inside<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> drain

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
a wrench that will fit inside the drain

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.260 
a wrench that will fit inside the drain
and<00:00:52.770> turning<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:54.170> like<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.879> what<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and turning it like so what you want to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
and turning it like so what you want to
do<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> want<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> drop<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.500> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
do is you want to drop this down in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.490 
do is you want to drop this down in
there<00:00:58.980> let<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.609> catch<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> cross<00:01:00.359> sites<00:01:01.170> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
there let it catch the cross sites on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.990 
there let it catch the cross sites on
the<00:01:01.739> drain<00:01:02.190> itself<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.840> turn<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
the drain itself and you want to turn it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
the drain itself and you want to turn it
