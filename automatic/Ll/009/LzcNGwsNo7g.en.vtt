00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.330
 The first time I see something is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.510
 other information but under this 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 the counter we have others and others 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
 products that interact with this projection 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.649
 including starting a projector and also 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090
