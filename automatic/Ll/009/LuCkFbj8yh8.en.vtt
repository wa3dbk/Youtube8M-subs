testing<00:00:09.720> out<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> d600<00:00:10.889> which<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.430> lot

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850

of<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.210> been<00:00:12.300> waiting<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.140> or

of you have been waiting on that or

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.490 
of you have been waiting on that or
something<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.000> stepping<00:00:15.540> stone<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.080> go<00:00:16.230> from

DX up to FX and I know for a lot of you
the<00:00:18.990> reason<00:00:19.349> is<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.499> the<00:00:19.769> low<00:00:19.919> light

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the reason is for the low light

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
the reason is for the low light
performance<00:00:20.329> so<00:00:21.329> I've<00:00:21.509> fired<00:00:21.839> off<00:00:22.079> a<00:00:22.320> series

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
performance so I've fired off a series

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.380 
performance so I've fired off a series
of<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.009> test<00:00:23.429> shots<00:00:23.669> here<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.150> their

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of different test shots here with their

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.399 
of different test shots here with their
d600<00:00:25.369> from<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.509> bottom<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> 100

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:28.409 
d600 from right down the bottom of 100

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:30.950 
d600 from right down the bottom of 100
all<00:00:28.589> the<00:00:28.679> way<00:00:28.769> through<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.069> high<00:00:29.369> too<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.089> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
all the way through the high too and I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
all the way through the high too and I
thought<00:00:31.859> rather<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.340> trying<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.790> show<00:00:33.030> them

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
thought rather than trying to show them

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.750 
thought rather than trying to show them
to<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.780> I'll<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.620> put<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.489> at

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to you here I'll just put them all up at

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
to you here I'll just put them all up at
you<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.149> full<00:00:36.600> quality<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.320> flickr<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you know full quality on flickr so you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
you know full quality on flickr so you
can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.090> yourself<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.629> full

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
can see them for yourself at full

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
can see them for yourself at full
quality<00:00:40.109> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.129> know<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.429> your<00:00:41.460> own

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
quality and then you know make your own

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.470 
quality and then you know make your own
decision<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.660> course<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:44.190> raw<00:00:44.609> and<00:00:44.969> JPEG

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
decision of course I got raw and JPEG

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
decision of course I got raw and JPEG
but<00:00:45.660> there's<00:00:45.809> no<00:00:45.899> raw<00:00:46.140> dakotas<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.949> yet<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
but there's no raw dakotas just yet and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
but there's no raw dakotas just yet and
there's<00:00:47.670> no<00:00:47.789> point<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.179> sharing<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> raw

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
there's no point me sharing the raw

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
there's no point me sharing the raw
because<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.589> can't<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.460> i'll<00:00:51.149> share

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because you can't see it so i'll share

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.479 
because you can't see it so i'll share
the<00:00:51.629> JPEGs<00:00:52.079> exactly<00:00:52.679> as<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:52.980> came<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the JPEGs exactly as they came out of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.419 
the JPEGs exactly as they came out of
the<00:00:53.789> camera<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.559> make<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.890> own<00:00:55.949> mind<00:00:56.039> so

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
the camera and make up your own mind so

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.700 
the camera and make up your own mind so
click<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.879> link<00:00:56.999> below<00:00:57.269> to<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> flickr<00:00:58.620> and

click the link below to go to flickr and
you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.129> those<00:00:59.309> ones<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.820> i'll<00:00:59.940> put

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you can see those ones there i'll put

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
you can see those ones there i'll put
them<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> set<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:00.929> guess<00:01:01.859> i<00:01:02.010> can't<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.519> jump

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
them in a set i guess i can't just jump

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
them in a set i guess i can't just jump
in<00:01:02.999> and<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.269> without<00:01:03.449> giving<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> some<00:01:04.589> kind

from the chief lens that was on this
camera<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:21.060> um<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.960> incredibly<00:01:22.590> soft<00:01:23.010> they

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
camera but um it's incredibly soft they

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.270 
camera but um it's incredibly soft they
have<00:01:23.670> um<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.100> noise

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
have um you know there when the noise

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.180 
have um you know there when the noise
reduction<00:01:26.760> is<00:01:27.120> on<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:28.230> tends<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> soften<00:01:29.040> out

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
reduction is on it tends to soften out

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.340 
reduction is on it tends to soften out
details<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.030> prevent<00:01:30.510> too<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.050> of<00:01:31.260> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
details to prevent too much of the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140 
details to prevent too much of the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
grainy detail we can still see some of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.560 
grainy detail we can still see some of
the<00:01:33.300> key<00:01:33.510> but<00:01:34.080> that's<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.250> that's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
the key but that's up at I think that's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
the key but that's up at I think that's
12,800<00:01:36.570> ISO<00:01:36.720> year<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:37.650> 6400<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.180> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
12,800 ISO year was that's 6400 so it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.720 
12,800 ISO year was that's 6400 so it's
really<00:01:39.690> not<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.050> bad<00:01:40.260> performance<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.580> try

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
really not a bad performance I will try

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.400 
really not a bad performance I will try
and<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.360> sample<00:01:42.960> shots<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
and get some more sample shots with the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.590 
and get some more sample shots with the
noise<00:01:43.530> reduction<00:01:43.860> off<00:01:44.250> altogether<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
noise reduction off altogether so that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
noise reduction off altogether so that
