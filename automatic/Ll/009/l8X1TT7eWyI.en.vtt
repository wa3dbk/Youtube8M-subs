 I stuck it on the crossbar and went back to the fence 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.510
 almost the same thing happens to me 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.560

 It's taking me not very well as the 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.990

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.320

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.849

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.839
 you head exactly 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:36.239
 when they made the equipment section 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:40.729
 there are up to three per side yes but no 

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:40.729

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.170
