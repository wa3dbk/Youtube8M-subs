all<00:00:07.319> right<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.680> go<00:00:07.799> we'll<00:00:08.010> go<00:00:08.040> back<00:00:08.309> in

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
all right here we go we'll go back in

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.480 
all right here we go we'll go back in
for<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.030> more<00:00:09.360> sure<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.710> we'll<00:00:11.040> make<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.460> we

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
for one more sure so we'll make it so we

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.860 
for one more sure so we'll make it so we
can<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.820> least<00:00:11.849> finish<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> next

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
can at least finish it in the next

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.689 
can at least finish it in the next
Island<00:00:13.170> through<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> jet<00:00:13.679> stream<00:00:13.849> um<00:00:16.310> now<00:00:17.310> i

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
Island through the jet stream um now i

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.670 
Island through the jet stream um now i
think<00:00:18.210> i<00:00:18.330> saw<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> jet<00:00:18.869> stream<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.380> other

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
think i saw a jet stream in the other

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240 
think i saw a jet stream in the other
one<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:21.260> yes<00:00:22.260> that's<00:00:22.590> definitely<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
one and yes that's definitely go to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
one and yes that's definitely go to
Uncle<00:00:23.519> through<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.590> jet

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
Uncle through that one and this jet

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.540 
Uncle through that one and this jet
stream<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> blue<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.810> red<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.550> red

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
stream there's a blue and a red up a red

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
stream there's a blue and a red up a red
one<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.939> blue<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.720> green<00:00:30.750> cab<00:00:31.349> over<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.859> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
one a blue and a green cab over there so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
one a blue and a green cab over there so
I'm<00:00:32.099> guessing<00:00:32.340> cuz<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> through<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> jet

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I'm guessing cuz the through the jet

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.030 
I'm guessing cuz the through the jet
stream<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.930> had<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> green<00:00:34.590> cap<00:00:34.860> for

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
stream I had to get the green cap for

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
stream I had to get the green cap for
the<00:00:35.100> other<00:00:35.280> water<00:00:35.550> level<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.149> guessing

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the other water level so I'm guessing

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
the other water level so I'm guessing
it's<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.500> that's<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's this one because that's like the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
it's this one because that's like the
vortex<00:00:38.899> that's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> jet<00:00:40.379> stream<00:00:41.270> it's<00:00:42.270> like

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
vortex that's not a jet stream it's like

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.959 
vortex that's not a jet stream it's like
a<00:00:42.420> cyclone<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.350> already<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.309> something<00:00:44.820> with

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
a cyclone I already got something with

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
a cyclone I already got something with
that<00:00:45.000> yeah<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:46.050> sure<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.410> one's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that yeah I'm pretty sure this one's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.360 
that yeah I'm pretty sure this one's
over<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.600> pretty<00:00:48.600> sure<00:00:49.010> see<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> thing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
over here pretty sure see this thing

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
over here pretty sure see this thing
yeah<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.300> yeah<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.020> jet<00:00:52.199> stream

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
yeah is that yeah that's the jet stream

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
yeah is that yeah that's the jet stream
right<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:52.920> yeah<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> see<00:00:53.670> those<00:00:53.910> circles<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
right there yeah I see those circles I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.610 
right there yeah I see those circles I
probably<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> jump<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.289> them

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
probably have to jump through them

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.219 
probably have to jump through them
probably<00:00:57.020> yeah<00:00:58.020> alright<00:00:59.420> looks<00:01:00.420> easy<00:01:00.600> enough

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.780 

alright<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.549> like

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
alright so what do I I got to get like

alright so what do I I got to get like
just<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> metal<00:01:06.750> cap<00:01:07.280> what's<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> point<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
just the metal cap what's the point of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.990 
just the metal cap what's the point of
the<00:01:08.700> blue<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:10.130> did<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.430> all

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the blue one being there did we go all

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.280 
the blue one being there did we go all
right<00:01:12.180> oh<00:01:13.520> man<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.610> nowhere<00:01:14.729> near<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.360> jeez<00:01:16.259> oh
