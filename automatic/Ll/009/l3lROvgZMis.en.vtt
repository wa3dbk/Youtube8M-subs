00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
so heat a pressure cooker and add just a
tablespoon<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:15.150> oil<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> everyday

recipe<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.420> prefer<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.290> less<00:01:19.950> amount
