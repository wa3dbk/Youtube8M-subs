you

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.060 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.920 

you

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.540 

we'd<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.170> what<00:00:22.349> the<00:00:22.470> acer<00:00:22.619> iconia<00:00:22.949> dual

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
we'd see what the acer iconia dual

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.339 
we'd see what the acer iconia dual
screen<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.240> holds<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.169> time

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
screen really holds up and now it's time

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.439 
screen really holds up and now it's time
for<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.769> first<00:00:26.070> impressions<00:00:26.699> well<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
for my first impressions well on the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.389 
for my first impressions well on the
outside<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.079> it<00:00:28.320> looks<00:00:28.500> absolutely<00:00:28.739> need

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
outside I think it looks absolutely need

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.110 
outside I think it looks absolutely need
the<00:00:29.640> metal<00:00:29.880> body<00:00:30.180> finish<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> very<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.560> nice

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
the metal body finish is very very nice

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
the metal body finish is very very nice
the<00:00:33.120> problem<00:00:33.480> comes<00:00:33.629> when<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.199> to<00:00:34.379> hold<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the problem comes when I have to hold it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
the problem comes when I have to hold it
up<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.670> any<00:00:35.940> particular<00:00:36.269> reason<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:37.079> 2.5

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
up for any particular reason it's 2.5

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
up for any particular reason it's 2.5
cages<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.000> quite<00:00:39.360> heavy

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
cages and I think it's quite heavy

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.450 
cages and I think it's quite heavy
especially<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.409> comparison<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.159> other

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
especially in comparison to the other

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
especially in comparison to the other
notebooks<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.239> market<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> magic

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
notebooks in the market but the magic

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.640 
notebooks in the market but the magic
comes<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:45.059> open<00:00:45.839> it<00:00:45.960> because

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
comes when I actually open it because

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.829 
comes when I actually open it because
instead<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> seeing<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.059> regular<00:00:48.540> keyboard

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
instead of seeing a regular keyboard

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.710 
instead of seeing a regular keyboard
right<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.670> see<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.269> screams

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
right here I actually see two screams

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.020 
right here I actually see two screams
and<00:00:52.019> that<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.589> course<00:00:52.619> is<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.250> normal<00:00:53.580> factor

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and that of course is the normal factor

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
and that of course is the normal factor
and<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:55.080> you<00:00:55.290> don't<00:00:55.470> see<00:00:55.739> many<00:00:55.979> buttons

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and there you don't see many buttons

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.070 
and there you don't see many buttons
here<00:00:56.640> except<00:00:57.089> for<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.360> power<00:00:57.570> button<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
here except for the power button that

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.289 
here except for the power button that
also<00:00:58.379> towards<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.680> side<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.400> where<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.030> soon

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
also towards the side and where as soon

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.109 
also towards the side and where as soon
as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:01.140> put<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.860> up<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.220> truly

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 
as you actually put it up it truly

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.600 
as you actually put it up it truly
doesn't<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:03.659> too<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:03.839> time<00:01:04.229> either

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
doesn't take too much time either

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.700 
doesn't take too much time either
initially<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.759> does<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.259> time<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
initially it does take a little time to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.350 
initially it does take a little time to
actually<00:01:08.009> get<00:01:08.310> used<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> fact<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
actually get used to the fact that you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually get used to the fact that you
need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.560> browse<00:01:10.950> through<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
need to you know browse through the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
need to you know browse through the
upper<00:01:11.880> screen<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.840> hands<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.290> like

that sensitive right here what I
particularly<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.100> glass<00:01:17.400> bottom

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
particularly like is the glass bottom

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to the top screen but the most

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.500 
to the top screen but the most
interesting<00:01:25.470> part<00:01:26.010> is<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.580> acer<00:01:26.820> ring<00:01:27.240> now

quite<00:02:42.120> interesting<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.319> way<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.340> just

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
quite interesting the way it all just

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.839 
quite interesting the way it all just
slides<00:02:45.629> down<00:02:46.049> from<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.709> top<00:02:46.890> screen<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.819> the

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
slides down from the top screen to the

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.140 
slides down from the top screen to the
bottom<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.510> quite<00:02:49.079> nice<00:02:49.500> though<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.610> not<00:02:50.760> too

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
bottom is quite nice though it's not too

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.850 
bottom is quite nice though it's not too
seamless<00:02:51.599> because<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.319> course<00:02:52.530> there<00:02:52.739> are

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
seamless because of course there are

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.920 
seamless because of course there are
investments<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.359> it's<00:02:54.510> quite<00:02:54.720> nice

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
investments out here but it's quite nice

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.039 
investments out here but it's quite nice
overall<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.910> finally<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.120> think<00:02:57.540> which<00:02:57.900> is

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
overall and finally I think which is

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.080 
overall and finally I think which is
also<00:02:58.290> very<00:02:58.530> interesting<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.459> your

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
also very interesting is that your

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
also very interesting is that your
keyboard<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.140> customized<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.890> terms<00:03:02.099> of

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
keyboard can be customized in terms of

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.009 
keyboard can be customized in terms of
designs<00:03:02.670> there<00:03:02.940> are<00:03:03.060> various<00:03:03.390> skins<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.900> you

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
designs there are various skins that you

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.170 
designs there are various skins that you
can<00:03:04.200> choose<00:03:04.410> from<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.459> think<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.940> just

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
can choose from and I think it just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.960 
can choose from and I think it just
makes<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:07.709> very<00:03:07.920> interesting<00:03:08.220> typing

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
makes for some very interesting typing

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.030 
makes for some very interesting typing
now<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.720> may<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:09.959> sounded<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.650> lot<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
now that may have sounded like a lot of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.520 
now that may have sounded like a lot of
good<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.730> know<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.970> few<00:03:12.329> bags<00:03:12.750> may<00:03:13.109> be<00:03:13.170> so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
good but you know a few bags may be so

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:44.430 
good but you know a few bags may be so
strong<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.099> they<00:03:14.220> outweigh<00:03:14.819> all<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.299> goods
