package

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.070

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
then lay the package on the side to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.140 
then lay the package on the side to
finish<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.500> last<00:00:59.710> end<00:01:00.040> we<00:01:00.730> still<00:01:00.910> have<00:01:01.090> a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
finish the last end we still have a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.180 
finish the last end we still have a
little<00:01:01.270> bit<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.510> excess<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.560> we'll<00:01:02.770> cut<00:01:03.040> that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
little bit of excess so we'll cut that

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.060 
little bit of excess so we'll cut that
off<00:01:03.489> also<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:05.229> continue<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.770> fold<00:01:05.979> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.020 
off also and then continue to fold the
paper<00:01:06.190> into<00:01:06.430> itself<00:01:08.160> now<00:01:09.190> take<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.550> generous

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030

first<00:01:12.910> once<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> second<00:01:15.010> time<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.369> see<00:01:15.400> how

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
first once then a second time to see how

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.630 
first once then a second time to see how
much<00:01:16.150> we<00:01:16.360> need<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:18.479> go<00:01:19.479> back<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.460> lay<00:01:21.460> the

pull at the ribbon on the sides so that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630 
pull at the ribbon on the sides so that
it's<00:01:54.030> even<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> there's<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> last<00:01:56.340> step

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it's even and then there's one last step

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's even and then there's one last step
you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.540> spruce<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> ribbon<00:01:58.560> ends<00:01:58.710> by

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you can spruce up the ribbon ends by

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.139 
you can spruce up the ribbon ends by
pulling<00:01:59.460> them<00:01:59.549> along<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> blade<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> the

pulling them along the blade of the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
pulling them along the blade of the
scissors<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> they<00:02:00.840> curl<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.290> looks<00:02:01.740> nice

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
scissors and they curl up looks nice

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.119
