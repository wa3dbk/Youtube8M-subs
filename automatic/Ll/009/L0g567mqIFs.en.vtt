where<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.130> came<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.780> when<00:02:23.050> my<00:02:23.080> son

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
where I came up with this when my son

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.230 
where I came up with this when my son
was<00:02:23.560> learning<00:02:24.070> how<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> tie<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> shoe<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.180> it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
was learning how to tie a shoe and it

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.050 
was learning how to tie a shoe and it
really<00:02:25.570> helped<00:02:26.170> him<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.250> difference<00:02:27.820> of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
really helped him see the difference of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.990 
really helped him see the difference of
what<00:02:28.330> chu<00:02:28.750> lays<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.260> put<00:02:29.470> under<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.220> go

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
what chu lays to put under and go

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.380 
what chu lays to put under and go
through<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.860> that's<00:02:32.860> where<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.190> came<00:02:33.340> from<00:02:33.400> so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
through so that's where it came from so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.050
