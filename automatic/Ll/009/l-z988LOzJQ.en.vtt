00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
years and these boots are probably the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.730 
years and these boots are probably the
best<00:01:04.009> boots<00:01:04.250> I've<00:01:04.460> ever<00:01:04.670> worn<00:01:05.290> you'll<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.530> me

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
them and they say they're not waterproof

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.609 
them and they say they're not waterproof
boot<00:01:11.090> they're<00:01:11.300> not<00:01:11.450> sold<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> waterproof

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.130 
boot they're not sold as a waterproof
boot<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:13.790> going<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.060> argue<00:01:14.240> against<00:01:14.780> that

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
boot but I'm going to argue against that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.990 
boot but I'm going to argue against that
I've<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:15.979> been<00:01:16.130> right<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.490> through<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.759> river

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
I've just been right up through a river

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.230 
I've just been right up through a river
and<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:18.380> wasn't<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.920> deep<00:01:19.160> admittedly<00:01:19.759> at

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
and it wasn't that deep admittedly at

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.969 
and it wasn't that deep admittedly at
the<00:01:20.479> deepest<00:01:21.020> part<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.560> river<00:01:21.590> had

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
the deepest part of the river had

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.590 
the deepest part of the river had
actually<00:01:22.369> come<00:01:22.580> up<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.880> my<00:01:23.030> ankles<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:25.600> my

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
actually come up to my ankles and my

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.260 
actually come up to my ankles and my
socks<00:01:26.990> are<00:01:27.800> all<00:01:28.009> foam<00:01:28.340> dry<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.970> I've<00:01:29.060> checked

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
socks are all foam dry and I've checked

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.050 
socks are all foam dry and I've checked
the<00:01:29.450> boots<00:01:29.720> inside<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.039> I<00:01:31.130> even<00:01:31.310> left<00:01:31.670> them<00:01:31.910> to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
the boots inside and I even left them to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.940 
the boots inside and I even left them to
soak<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.570> water<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.500> whether<00:01:33.710> they

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
soak the water in to see whether they

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.180 
soak the water in to see whether they
would<00:01:34.190> take<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.700> any<00:01:34.940> water<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.479> they<00:01:35.570> haven't

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
would take on any water and they haven't

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.350 
would take on any water and they haven't
so<00:01:37.190> although<00:01:37.369> they're<00:01:37.700> not<00:01:37.820> sold<00:01:38.149> as

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
so although they're not sold as

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.870 
so although they're not sold as
waterproof<00:01:39.020> I'm<00:01:39.710> going<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.190> argue<00:01:40.369> against

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
waterproof I'm going to argue against

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.389 
waterproof I'm going to argue against
that<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.720> that's<00:01:42.080> really<00:01:42.289> unusual<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
that and that's really unusual for a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.480 
that and that's really unusual for a
reviewer<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.300> argue<00:01:44.659> against<00:01:45.490> manufacturing

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
reviewer to argue against manufacturing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.770 
reviewer to argue against manufacturing
ticket<00:01:46.940> but<00:01:47.690> I<00:01:47.720> say<00:01:48.050> they<00:01:48.229> are<00:01:48.409> waterproof<00:01:49.780> all

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
ticket but I say they are waterproof all

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.070 
ticket but I say they are waterproof all
in<00:01:51.050> all<00:01:51.170> they're<00:01:51.500> super<00:01:51.979> comfortable<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
in all they're super comfortable and

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.600 
in all they're super comfortable and
we'll<00:01:54.080> take<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.349> closer<00:01:54.709> look<00:01:55.009> at<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.280> minute<00:01:55.520> at

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
we'll take a closer look at a minute at

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.120 
we'll take a closer look at a minute at
the<00:01:55.700> boots<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.179> south<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.560> they<00:01:57.770> ought<00:01:57.920> for

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the boots and south and they ought for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.180 
the boots and south and they ought for
massive<00:01:58.759> ankle<00:01:59.209> support<00:01:59.420> a<00:02:00.080> few<00:02:00.709> two-year

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
massive ankle support a few two-year

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.550 
massive ankle support a few two-year
three-year<00:02:01.220> ago<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.149> actually<00:02:02.599> broke<00:02:03.020> my<00:02:03.259> foot

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
three-year ago I actually broke my foot

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.029 
three-year ago I actually broke my foot
when<00:02:03.709> I<00:02:03.739> was<00:02:03.920> out<00:02:04.300> in<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.330> field<00:02:05.599> and<00:02:06.039> since

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
when I was out in the field and since

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.229 
when I was out in the field and since
then<00:02:07.310> I've<00:02:07.459> always<00:02:07.759> had<00:02:07.849> a<00:02:07.910> slight<00:02:08.209> problem

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
then I've always had a slight problem

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.820 
then I've always had a slight problem
I've<00:02:08.929> been<00:02:09.170> wearing<00:02:09.380> these<00:02:09.590> boots

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
I've been wearing these boots

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.280 
I've been wearing these boots
intensively<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.849> two<00:02:11.090> weeks<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.020> that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
intensively for two weeks and that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.920 
intensively for two weeks and that
problem<00:02:12.770> was<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.790> extra<00:02:14.150> ankle<00:02:14.510> support

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
problem was the extra ankle support

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.809 
problem was the extra ankle support
seems<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.379> have<00:02:15.530> sorted<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.920> out<00:02:16.069> no<00:02:16.370> problems

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
seems to have sorted it out no problems

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.960 
seems to have sorted it out no problems
at<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.260> let's<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.459> that's<00:02:19.819> our

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
at all so let's get on and that's our

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.540 
at all so let's get on and that's our
closer<00:02:20.390> look<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:21.290> what<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.530> say<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.129> probably

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
closer look at what I say is probably

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.190 
closer look at what I say is probably
one<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> best<00:02:23.180> Bahgat<00:02:23.660> boots<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.739> buy

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
one of the best Bahgat boots you can buy

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.800 
one of the best Bahgat boots you can buy
so<00:02:27.200> here's<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.709> boot<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.360> boot<00:02:29.360> itself

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
so here's the boot of the boot itself

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.710 
so here's the boot of the boot itself

the helicopters flying over me you can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.619 
the helicopters flying over me you can
see<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.860> massif<00:02:34.400> ankle<00:02:34.819> support<00:02:35.239> you've<00:02:35.390> got

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
see the massif ankle support you've got

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.800 
see the massif ankle support you've got
here<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:37.520> stitching<00:02:37.940> inside<00:02:38.090> they've<00:02:38.629> got<00:02:38.750> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
here the stitching inside they've got a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.880 
here the stitching inside they've got a
real<00:02:39.020> nice<00:02:39.290> soft<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.629> spongy<00:02:41.629> quite<00:02:42.319> sole<00:02:42.650> in

real nice soft and spongy quite sole in
there<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.879> obviously<00:02:44.450> designed<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:45.470> when

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
there and you obviously designed so when
