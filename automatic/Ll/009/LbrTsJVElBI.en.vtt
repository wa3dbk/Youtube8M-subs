yours<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.990> called<00:03:14.240> another<00:03:15.240> feature<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.400> this

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
yours was called another feature of this

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.480 
yours was called another feature of this
program<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.290> one<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.410> my<00:03:19.530> favorites<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:22.490> when

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
program and one of my favorites is when

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.790 
program and one of my favorites is when
you<00:03:23.580> hover<00:03:23.760> over<00:03:24.120> any<00:03:24.300> hexadecimal<00:03:25.260> color<00:03:25.500> it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
you hover over any hexadecimal color it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.320 
you hover over any hexadecimal color it
gives<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:28.250> what<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.460> preview<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
gives you what a preview of what that

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.880 
gives you what a preview of what that
color<00:03:30.510> would<00:03:30.660> look<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.710> haven't

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
color would look so if you haven't

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.550 
color would look so if you haven't
memorized<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.720> colors<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.230> hexadecimal

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
memorized all the colors in hexadecimal

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.700 
memorized all the colors in hexadecimal
format<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.960> because<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.560> can

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
format you don't have to because you can

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.930 
format you don't have to because you can
just<00:03:37.860> hover<00:03:38.010> over<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:40.610> it'll<00:03:41.610> give<00:03:41.790> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
just hover over them and it'll give you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.500 
just hover over them and it'll give you
a<00:03:42.120> preview<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.660> what<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> actually<00:03:43.110> looks<00:03:43.350> like

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
a preview of what it actually looks like

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.480 
a preview of what it actually looks like
which<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.690> very<00:03:45.990> useful<00:03:46.170> feature<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:47.280> I

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
which is a very useful feature because I

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.690 
which is a very useful feature because I
myself<00:03:47.970> have<00:03:48.360> not<00:03:48.570> memorized<00:03:48.810> them<00:03:49.740> entirely

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.540

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
also if you hover over an image it gives

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.210 
also if you hover over an image it gives
you<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.360> dimensions<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.200> image<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.740> a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.480 
you the dimensions of the image and a
preview<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.180> image<00:04:00.680> which<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
preview of the image which this is the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.050

plug-in so you can install that people

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.200 
plug-in so you can install that people
have<00:05:29.930> made<00:05:30.170> because<00:05:30.470> it's<00:05:30.920> open<00:05:31.310> source<00:05:31.340> you

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
have made because it's open source you

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.860 
have made because it's open source you
can<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.540> browse<00:05:32.840> through<00:05:34.300> popular<00:05:35.300> plugins

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
can just browse through popular plugins

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.760 
can just browse through popular plugins
or<00:05:36.200> install<00:05:36.620> from<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:36.980> URL<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:38.530> someone's<00:05:39.530> put
