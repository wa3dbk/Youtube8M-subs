here on the pipe which is going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.940 
here on the pipe which is going to
completely<00:00:47.879> cover<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.600> any<00:00:48.870> bluing<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.649> gold

exhaust pipes from the heat of the motor
running<00:00:53.449> installation<00:00:54.449> should<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.660> 1<00:00:55.079> hour

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
running installation should take 1 hour

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
running installation should take 1 hour
or<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.430> taking<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:56.969> all

and<00:01:00.660> set<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.140> exhaust<00:01:01.559> wrap<00:01:02.120> inside<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and set this exhaust wrap inside this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
and set this exhaust wrap inside this
water<00:01:03.660> let<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> soak<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> water<00:01:04.710> what

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
water let it soak up the water what

water let it soak up the water what
that's<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> make

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that's going to do is it's going to make

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
that's going to do is it's going to make
it<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.360> pliable<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.500> pulling

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it really pliable so when we're pulling

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560 
it really pliable so when we're pulling
it<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> stretching<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.479> going

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it around and stretching it it's going

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.870 
it around and stretching it it's going
to<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> stick<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.680> hold<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.400> place<00:01:11.610> as

to kind of stick and hold into place as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.370 
to kind of stick and hold into place as
we're<00:01:12.030> wrapping<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.479> pipes<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:13.170> going

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
we're wrapping these pipes that's going

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.130

this<00:01:22.380> installation<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this installation we then going to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
this installation we then going to
remove<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.390> exhaust<00:01:24.689> pipes<00:01:25.080> bring<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:25.860> to

remove the exhaust pipes bring off to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
remove the exhaust pipes bring off to
the<00:01:26.070> table<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.850> it'll<00:01:27.060> show<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.630> is

that's going to keep all this frayed
part<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.689> nice<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:59.119> concealed<00:02:00.119> once<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.689> get

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
part here nice and concealed once we get

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.179 
part here nice and concealed once we get
this<00:02:00.960> folded<00:02:01.320> over<00:02:01.380> we're<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> start

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
this folded over we're going to start

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.030 
this folded over we're going to start
the<00:02:02.640> wrap<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:04.020> probably<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.380> quarter<00:02:04.619> inch<00:02:04.920> or

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the wrap just probably a quarter inch or

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
the wrap just probably a quarter inch or
so<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.549> from<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> exhaust<00:02:06.060> plan<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
so down from the exhaust plan so it can

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.669 
so down from the exhaust plan so it can
still<00:02:07.240> move<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.720> then<00:02:08.319> we're<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.530> going<00:02:08.649> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
still move and then we're just going to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.790 
still move and then we're just going to
wrap<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.250> slowly<00:02:10.090> but<00:02:10.390> surely<00:02:10.560> until<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.650> get

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
wrap this slowly but surely until we get

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:26.990 
wrap this slowly but surely until we get
as<00:02:12.040> far<00:02:12.489> down<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.819> pipe<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.209> mondo

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.149 

all<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.180> there<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:28.420> go<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:28.810> half<00:02:29.110> bad<00:02:29.409> so

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
all right there we go not half bad so

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.800 
all right there we go not half bad so
this<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.519> what<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> pipe<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.239> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.599> look

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
this is what the pipe is going to look

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.740 
this is what the pipe is going to look
like<00:02:31.840> from<00:02:32.560> your<00:02:33.250> perspective<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:34.390> point<00:02:34.659> of

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
we're going to do is we're going to wrap

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.330 
we're going to do is we're going to wrap
the<00:02:38.140> second<00:02:38.530> pipe<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.890> make<00:02:39.010> sure<00:02:39.159> we<00:02:39.280> don't

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the second pipe to make sure we don't

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.920 
the second pipe to make sure we don't
have<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.549> make<00:02:39.700> any<00:02:39.879> modifications<00:02:40.629> in<00:02:40.780> order

to<00:02:41.049> make<00:02:41.260> them<00:02:41.439> look<00:02:41.680> perfectly<00:02:42.400> matched

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.490 

all<00:02:56.390> right<00:02:56.569> there<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.290> about

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
all right there you have it in about

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.920 
all right there you have it in about
3035<00:02:58.069> minutes<00:02:58.489> you've<00:02:58.760> wrapped<00:02:59.030> both<00:02:59.599> of

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
3035 minutes you've wrapped both of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.009 
3035 minutes you've wrapped both of
these<00:03:00.230> pipes<00:03:00.620> now<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.390> can<00:03:02.480> see<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.840> takes

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
these pipes now as you can see it takes

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.449 
these pipes now as you can see it takes
a<00:03:03.140> little<00:03:03.319> bit<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.560> time<00:03:03.769> making<00:03:03.799> sure

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
a little bit of time making sure

that it doesn't move it doesn't shift it

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.789 
that it doesn't move it doesn't shift it
doesn't<00:03:25.099> feel<00:03:25.370> change<00:03:26.299> position<00:03:26.810> once<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.680> get

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
doesn't feel change position once we get

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.229 
doesn't feel change position once we get
done<00:03:27.920> doing<00:03:28.129> that<00:03:28.250> secure<00:03:28.760> we're<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.030> go<00:03:29.120> ahead
