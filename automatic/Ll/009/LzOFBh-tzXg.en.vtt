post-op nausea and vomiting are common
problems<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.280> modify<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
problems and we can modify the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.440 
problems and we can modify the
anaesthetic<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> minimize<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:38.270> then<00:01:39.270> ask

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
anaesthetic to minimize this I then ask

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
anaesthetic to minimize this I then ask
about<00:01:39.750> medical<00:01:40.170> problems<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:41.310> important<00:01:41.909> to

about medical problems it's important to

attention to cardio respiratory symptoms
and<00:01:45.990> disorders<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.060> important

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and disorders it's also really important

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.060 
and disorders it's also really important
to<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:49.020> idea<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> patient's
