00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
this is an O six Honda Rubicon and I

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.700 
this is an O six Honda Rubicon and I
installed<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.270> new<00:00:06.420> crankshaft<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:11.269> so<00:00:12.269> some

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
installed a new crankshaft in it so some

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
installed a new crankshaft in it so some

I<00:00:15.360> bought<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:17.039> torn<00:00:17.490> apart<00:00:18.770> you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:20.010> see

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
I bought it all torn apart you can see

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.410 
I bought it all torn apart you can see
on<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> side<00:00:22.220> got<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.140> that's<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.470> actual

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
on this side got the that's the actual

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
on this side got the that's the actual
automatic<00:00:30.560> transmission<00:00:31.940> something<00:00:32.940> just

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
automatic transmission something just

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.920 
automatic transmission something just
fell<00:00:33.329> off

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.599 

you

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.689 

but<00:00:40.239> case<00:00:41.109> you're<00:00:41.320> wanting<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.190> know<00:00:42.339> what<00:00:42.579> the

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
but case you're wanting to know what the

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:50.610 
but case you're wanting to know what the
inside<00:00:42.879> of<00:00:43.179> these<00:00:43.480> look<00:00:43.750> like<00:00:49.500> basically<00:00:50.500> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
inside of these look like basically the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.759 
inside of these look like basically the
same<00:00:50.920> as<00:00:51.159> any<00:00:51.699> other<00:00:52.269> one<00:00:52.780> it's<00:00:53.049> like<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.260> shift

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
same as any other one it's like a shift

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:08.770 
same as any other one it's like a shift
drum<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.190> them<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:58.149> less<00:00:58.420> years

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.980 

this<00:01:09.780> gear<00:01:10.109> actually<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:12.119> output<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
this gear actually is the output for the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.950 
this gear actually is the output for the
automatic<00:01:14.569> see<00:01:15.569> it's<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.679> neutral<00:01:16.829> right<00:01:17.189> now

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
automatic see it's in neutral right now

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.510 
automatic see it's in neutral right now
the<00:01:18.960> final<00:01:19.439> drive<00:01:19.679> gear<00:01:20.009> goes<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> drive

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the final drive gear goes on the drive

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.120 
the final drive gear goes on the drive
shaft<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.539> supplies<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.350> power<00:01:25.709> for<00:01:26.039> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
shaft that supplies the power for the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
shaft that supplies the power for the
front<00:01:26.399> differential<00:01:27.109> and<00:01:28.109> that's<00:01:28.289> for<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
front differential and that's for the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.279 
front differential and that's for the
rear<00:01:32.149> this<00:01:33.149> actually<00:01:33.569> goes<00:01:33.719> on<00:01:33.899> here<00:01:34.140> like

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
rear this actually goes on here like

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:53.430 
rear this actually goes on here like
this<00:01:35.509> it's<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.599> neutral<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:37.229> now

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.120

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
going to try to take some more videos as

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.500 
going to try to take some more videos as
I<00:01:59.580> assemble<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.700> here<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.590> just<00:02:03.550> went<00:02:03.880> step

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
I assemble it here but I just went step

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.790 
I assemble it here but I just went step
by<00:02:04.690> step<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.710> book<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.790> pretty<00:02:07.090> simple

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
by step in the book it's pretty simple

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.100 
by step in the book it's pretty simple
it<00:02:08.800> looks<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> lot<00:02:09.430> of<00:02:09.460> crap<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.810> really

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
it looks like a lot of crap it's really

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.310 
it looks like a lot of crap it's really
not<00:02:15.270> I'll<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.420> some<00:02:16.600> more<00:02:16.750> pictures<00:02:16.960> I'm

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
not I'll have some more pictures I'm

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.420 
not I'll have some more pictures I'm
putting<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.830> new<00:02:17.860> top<00:02:18.160> end<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:19.170> everything

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
putting a new top end on it everything

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.680 
putting a new top end on it everything
getting<00:02:21.430> ready<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> put<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.940> side<00:02:22.120> case<00:02:22.390> cover

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
getting ready to put the side case cover

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.970
