00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.400 
think any kind of game like this most of
the<00:03:55.329> time<00:03:55.450> -<00:03:55.569> games<00:03:55.720> like<00:03:55.870> these<00:03:55.959> are<00:03:56.140> soccer

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the time - games like these are soccer

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.880 
the time - games like these are soccer
or<00:03:56.709> football<00:03:57.220> games<00:03:58.110> they<00:03:59.110> just<00:03:59.140> don't<00:03:59.650> work

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
or football games they just don't work

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.750 
or football games they just don't work
on<00:04:00.069> a<00:04:00.099> board<00:04:00.370> game

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
on a board game

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.319 
on a board game
they<00:04:00.910> just<00:04:01.090> don't<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:02.470> just<00:04:03.030> when<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.120> comes

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
they just don't it just when it comes

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.270 
they just don't it just when it comes
down<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.440> pictures<00:04:05.950> are<00:04:06.069> funny

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
down to it that the pictures are funny

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.610 
down to it that the pictures are funny
the<00:04:06.609> idea<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> okay<00:04:07.150> even<00:04:08.079> though<00:04:08.230> obviously

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
the idea is okay even though obviously

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.220 
the idea is okay even though obviously
they've<00:04:09.160> lifted<00:04:09.519> mechanics<00:04:09.940> from<00:04:10.180> loss<00:04:10.840> you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
they've lifted mechanics from loss you

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.199 
they've lifted mechanics from loss you
know<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.560> Lord<00:04:11.859> of<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.980> Rings<00:04:12.209> confrontation

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
know the Lord of the Rings confrontation

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.309 
know the Lord of the Rings confrontation
and<00:04:13.420> things<00:04:13.540> like<00:04:13.660> that

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
and things like that

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.729 
and things like that
the<00:04:14.620> pointed<00:04:15.069> cards<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.519> stuff<00:04:15.640> but<00:04:16.739> it's

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
the pointed cards and stuff but it's

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.539 
the pointed cards and stuff but it's
just<00:04:18.299> boring<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:20.169> wanted<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.340> more

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
just boring I I wanted to like it more

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.390 
just boring I I wanted to like it more
but<00:04:22.240> action<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:22.990> slow<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.289> move<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.949> move<00:04:24.160> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
but action is so slow I move I move I

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.550 
but action is so slow I move I move I
move<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.820> move<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.240> move<00:04:25.449> and<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:26.050> almost<00:04:26.229> feels

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
move I move I move and it almost feels

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320 
move I move I move and it almost feels
like<00:04:26.590> an<00:04:26.770> abstract<00:04:27.190> chess<00:04:27.610> match<00:04:27.940> than<00:04:28.210> it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
like an abstract chess match than it

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.960 
like an abstract chess match than it
does<00:04:28.539> like<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.810> sport<00:04:29.380> game<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.760> may<00:04:30.910> be

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
does like a sport game and that may be

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.180 
does like a sport game and that may be
interesting<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:31.990> but<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
interesting to you but I I just the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.700 
interesting to you but I I just the
thing<00:04:33.400> here<00:04:33.669> is<00:04:33.849> I<00:04:34.030> did<00:04:34.479> see<00:04:34.660> anything<00:04:35.080> new<00:04:35.380> or

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.200 
thing here is I did see anything new or
interesting<00:04:36.370> from<00:04:36.550> other<00:04:36.760> games<00:04:37.030> I've

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
interesting from other games I've

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.580 
interesting from other games I've
already<00:04:37.450> played<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> little<00:04:37.930> soccer<00:04:38.229> game<00:04:38.470> as

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
already played a little soccer game as

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.080 
already played a little soccer game as
we<00:04:38.680> move<00:04:38.830> around<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.639> know<00:04:39.700> it's<00:04:39.940> not

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
we move around and I know it's not

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.029 
we move around and I know it's not
soccer<00:04:40.419> it's<00:04:40.690> rugby<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.169> it<00:04:41.289> didn't<00:04:41.620> feel

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
soccer it's rugby but it didn't feel

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.010 
soccer it's rugby but it didn't feel
like<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.340> was<00:04:42.490> any<00:04:42.760> much<00:04:43.120> different<00:04:43.630> than<00:04:43.750> a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
like it was any much different than a

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.589 
like it was any much different than a
soccer<00:04:44.710> game<00:04:45.090> except<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.150> new<00:04:46.270> soccer<00:04:46.479> game

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
soccer game except the new soccer game

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.570 
soccer game except the new soccer game
you<00:04:46.720> can't<00:04:46.900> pass<00:04:47.110> forward<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.250> mean<00:04:48.550> that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
you can't pass forward that I mean that

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.570 
you can't pass forward that I mean that
that's<00:04:49.120> basically<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.770> felt<00:04:51.010> like<00:04:51.160> and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's basically what it felt like and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.250 
that's basically what it felt like and
and<00:04:51.789> for<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.090> matter<00:04:52.419> I'm<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.840> not<00:04:52.990> that

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
and for that matter I'm just not that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.960 
and for that matter I'm just not that
impressed<00:04:53.800> with<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.190> game<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970

impressed with the game I like the
artwork<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:56.099> seems<00:04:57.099> like<00:04:57.430> some<00:04:57.729> people<00:04:58.120> might

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
artwork it seems like some people might

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.779 
artwork it seems like some people might
like<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.650> just<00:04:59.919> haven't<00:05:00.070> met<00:05:00.400> any<00:05:00.580> of
