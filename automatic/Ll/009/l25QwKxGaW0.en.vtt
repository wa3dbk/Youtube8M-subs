00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
into there you can see we outlined to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.050 
all the text with the black outline this
actually<00:01:03.090> took<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.480> four<00:01:03.780> hours<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.260> do

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
actually took me about four hours to do

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
actually took me about four hours to do
with<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> actual<00:01:06.810> paint<00:01:07.049> brush<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.000> drawing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
with a actual paint brush and drawing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.649 
with a actual paint brush and drawing
the<00:01:09.180> text<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> outline<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.479> really<00:01:12.479> hard

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the text on the outline so really hard

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
the text on the outline so really hard
to<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.900> took<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> very<00:01:13.770> long<00:01:13.860> time<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> think

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
to do took a very long time but I think

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.020 
to do took a very long time but I think
it<00:01:14.729> paid<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> end<00:01:15.240> looks<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:15.750> nice

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
