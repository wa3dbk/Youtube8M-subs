00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.570
 and after that I use patrice's 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.470
 fotofinish foundation because the series 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.950

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.830
 and in connection I take from my 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.800
 love the pet bottle range 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.619
 with news.de 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.060
 I 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 until they think 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.890
 Now it's time for the eyebrows 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.330
 use one for this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 eyes and writing that's the word 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.680
 and feel my eyebrows out of me 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.660
 I think he was really good 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is very fine and you actually have it yourself 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.430
 Active can work with it 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.750
 then I use from meg 1 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.940
 ford in the color panther the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.310
 and give it like a kind of credit card 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.350
 on my eyes not open and I think 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.350
 it makes even skin picture 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.599

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.640
 Yes 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.379
 he agrees with the gang 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.420
 This look is kept relatively good 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.140
 that affects the eyes so much 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.160
 is atypical 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.160
 why not something else 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.120
 and then suddenly the field again 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.390

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.330

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.480

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.490

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.130
 be applied 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.100
 take your time for it, of course, in the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.710
 lips brush to help 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.140
 and then I work out properly 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.530
 here again with the contralto foundation 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.530
 about that 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.090

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.159
 and then blinded the whole thing with mine 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.159
 Sigfusson 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.410
 and now in the hair 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.410
 knowledge 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.660

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.450

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.330
 and then of course with hairspray 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.790
 I would not fix that whole thing 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.590
 smother 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.980
 and yes maybe the nails are then 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.980
 I would say 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.650
 i have a dream i would say 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.050

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.860
 Great because they are very cover 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.860
 and weighed well on trot 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.710
