00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello to all and bayard we cracked we have 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.760
 wanted to let go of the microphone we were going 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.390
 support the basketball players like you 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.070
 could see it 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.300
 we knew it was going to happen 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.250
 because we've been following them since 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.000
 beginning of the competition we wanted to see 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.720
 what it gave 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 and look at the result screaming is very 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.189
 very very very strong for France 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.189
 e 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.500
 she 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.870
 at 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.080
 a huge feat little head but must 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.640
 not believe enough for people to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 the team who preferred to title on the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.200
 Jamaican treble over 200 meters relegating the 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.360
 greatest French feat in these 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 games on page 10 it's not foul 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.660
 to have insisted even tony parker has 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:50.010
 claimed the basketball players to the one of 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:51.750
 the team be a newspaper every 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.120
 athletes in dreams and so we have them 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.050
 asked what title he would like to see the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:02.220
 day after their coronation 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:05.160
 finally the grail hello earth here the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.930
 red white blue handballs and then 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.670
 with our pictures below I remember 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.410
 in 2003 it was stunning but 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.240
 I do not know if I said 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.280
 now I think it would not be so 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.420
 crazy that's making it so you me that I 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.959
 let my instinct guide me and we 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.430
 will see 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.790
 I think we have to hope 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.260
 to be the only French gold medalist for 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.969
 the first page one 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.439
 finally maybe with a point 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.180
 of exclamation it's been 20 years since 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.349
 wait for him at the sword men so maybe 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.670
 it could be funny 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.459
 we go when I was world champion 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 junior the title that was released is the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.310
 road on the roof of the world and that's me 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.849
 pleased then it was the road on the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.270
 olympic roof 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.740
 we will change a bridge 20 years and is already 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.170
 first title something like that 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.520
 if not return to earth France is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.690
 still stuck at 8 gold medals 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.510
 for a week now 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.580
 will renaud lavillenia finally be the one 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.440
 that will unlock the meter and bring back 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.270
 the ninth medal so much hoped for 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 club france is a very discipline 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.750
 random perch 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.010
 even though the hyper favorite we saw when 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.440
 his last two outings 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.470
 could quit and a contest 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.550
 Olympic there remains an Olympic competition 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.890
 Jean Galfione are better placed than me 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.960
 or the late rock quinon also 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 but it's true that we often have a 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.360
 champion who may not be the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.310
 favorite is the one who is more attentive 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.050
 the most concentrated and perhaps also 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.460
 the best tactician and the one who has 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.830
 more teeth lying on the floor and 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.090
 who does not doubt that he can win 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.680
 who will win because there will be 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.430
 always a winner but not necessarily 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.430
 the one we are waiting for
