aware<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.670> Sony<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.420> apparently<00:02:21.930> releasing

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
aware that Sony is apparently releasing

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650 
aware that Sony is apparently releasing
a<00:02:22.560> patch<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.070> think<00:02:23.340> sometime<00:02:24.000> early<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.480> year

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
a patch I think sometime early this year

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.770 
a patch I think sometime early this year
to<00:02:25.080> allow<00:02:25.320> people<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.130> record<00:02:26.490> gameplay<00:02:26.780> from

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
to allow people to record gameplay from

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.630 
to allow people to record gameplay from
their<00:02:28.020> capture<00:02:28.260> cards<00:02:28.800> without<00:02:29.010> using<00:02:29.460> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
their capture cards without using a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.360 
their capture cards without using a
bypass<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.530> again<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:32.250> aware

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
bypass like this so again just be aware

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.310 
bypass like this so again just be aware
of<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.180> don't<00:02:33.330> buy<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.170> then

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
of that so you don't buy one and then

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.230 
of that so you don't buy one and then
all<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.500> sudden<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.950> patch<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.460> released<00:02:35.820> like
