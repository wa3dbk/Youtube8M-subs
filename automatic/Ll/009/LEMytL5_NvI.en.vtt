00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
really some people have actually made a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.410 
really some people have actually made a
thing<00:00:06.870> called<00:00:07.140> sinha<00:00:07.649> skates<00:00:08.210> basically<00:00:09.210> what

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
thing called sinha skates basically what

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.240 
thing called sinha skates basically what
this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:10.110> know<00:00:10.230> those<00:00:10.410> tripods<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.160> are

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
this is you know those tripods that are

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.789 
this is you know those tripods that are
very<00:00:11.550> bendable<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.389> flexible<00:00:13.019> 2<00:00:13.170> 3<00:00:13.500> tripod

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
very bendable and flexible 2 3 tripod

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.029 
very bendable and flexible 2 3 tripod
light<00:00:14.099> like<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:16.020> flexible<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
light like that it's flexible like that

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.040 
light like that it's flexible like that
well<00:00:17.640> basically<00:00:17.910> what<00:00:18.390> they've<00:00:18.570> done<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
well basically what they've done is

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.010 
well basically what they've done is
create<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.800> wheel<00:00:20.460> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> bottom<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
create a little wheel at the bottom that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 
create a little wheel at the bottom that
connects<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> little<00:00:23.070> tripods<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.570> all

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
connects to the little tripods on it all

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
connects to the little tripods on it all
wheels<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.529> does<00:00:25.769> means<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.340> can

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
wheels what this does means you can

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.009 
wheels what this does means you can
actually<00:00:26.670> put<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.210> camera<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> tripod

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
actually put your camera on the tripod

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.710 
actually put your camera on the tripod
and<00:00:28.470> slide<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.880> probably<00:00:30.119> why<00:00:30.390> would<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and slide it now probably why would you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.670 
and slide it now probably why would you
want<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.130> didn't<00:00:32.399> realize<00:00:32.759> most<00:00:33.210> um

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
want this if you didn't realize most um

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.410 
want this if you didn't realize most um
filmmakers<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.309> probably<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.120> realize

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
filmmakers use you probably did realize

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
filmmakers use you probably did realize
if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.780> closely<00:00:37.260> movies<00:00:38.190> um<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
if you look closely movies um when that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
if you look closely movies um when that
keep<00:00:39.840> cause<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:40.950> underneath

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
keep cause it's something underneath

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
keep cause it's something underneath
then<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.760> move<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> they

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
then they move over like that and they

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.190 
then they move over like that and they
slide<00:00:43.620> across<00:00:44.010> well<00:00:44.789> yeah<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.899> actually

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
slide across well yeah there's actually

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.709 
slide across well yeah there's actually
it's<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.820> cheap<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.539> very

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it's not it's not cheap it's very

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
it's not it's not cheap it's very
expensive<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.350> could<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.680> achieve<00:00:49.770> Lee

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
expensive that you could do achieve Lee

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
expensive that you could do achieve Lee
but<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> want<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.899> into

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
but but it's if you want to go out into

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.689 
but but it's if you want to go out into
a<00:00:52.379> film<00:00:52.590> store<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> buy<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.520> pretty

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
a film store and buy it it's pretty

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
a film store and buy it it's pretty
expensive<00:00:53.879> took<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> broad<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.590> put<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
expensive took a broad you put the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
expensive took a broad you put the
camera<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> push<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> across<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.930> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
camera on and you push it across this is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.240 
camera on and you push it across this is
actually<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.469> better<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.129> on

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
actually much better because it's on

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
actually much better because it's on
wheels<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> go<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.300> different

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
wheels so they can go on different

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
wheels so they can go on different
patterns<00:01:01.410> moving<00:01:01.890> circles<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.579> lose<00:01:02.789> all

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
patterns moving circles it can lose all

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
patterns moving circles it can lose all
weird<00:01:03.180> maneuvers<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:05.189> still

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
weird maneuvers right and it still

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
weird maneuvers right and it still
glides<00:01:05.820> across<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
glides across right so I think this is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.789 
glides across right so I think this is
pretty<00:01:07.770> nice<00:01:08.070> um<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:09.150> thing<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> does

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pretty nice um no thing when it does

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.050 
pretty nice um no thing when it does
