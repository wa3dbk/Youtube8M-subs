 Hey guys, window here :) Today I leave you 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 see how to mount a wide. You can use 5 types of paddocks to breed, 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.100
 Patter for higher balance. Slacker for lower balance. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:50.100
 Lightning thrower for stamina. Drinking trough for Maturity. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 And the dragobut for love. For stamina -1 to -10000 balance required. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 Required for maturity -2000 to +2000 balance. For Love +1 to +10 000 balance required. 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 Balance has no difference on energy. Late here 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 I see the water troughs, so this mount can be put in this paddock because balance 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 between -2000 and +2000. Your mount must be lvl 5 to be able to breed. 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.320
 Love and stamina must also be above 7500. 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 (He will grow in the water basin paddock) Here you see patters, 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.510
 these make the balance higher. this emerald / golden mount must therefore be love 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.170
 I put it in patter for higher balance (which must be above +1 for love). 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.170
 Here you see slappers, here you can lower your balance. 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.330
 These mounts need stamina and are under a balanca of 0. 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.750
 7500 stamina and 7500 love needed (on a lvl 5mount) for being able to knit. 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 Tiredness goes 10 off every hour, so you 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.360
 can leave the mount in the padock as long as the balance is good. 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:47.499
 Mounts can only breed 20x. For love you need more than 1 balance like you 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:58.189
 see here. Last paddock is Energy, you have to fill this 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:14.009
 for a chance to have more babies, Recommended !!! .. Thanks for looking :)
