sometimes<00:00:21.450> you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.140> make<00:00:22.289> them<00:00:22.470> look<00:00:22.620> bigger

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
sometimes you can make them look bigger

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.210 
sometimes you can make them look bigger
in<00:00:23.160> areas<00:00:23.670> where<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.030> are<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> bit<00:00:24.450> weak<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
in areas where they are a bit weak and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.529 
in areas where they are a bit weak and
sometimes<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.460> they've<00:00:26.610> got<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.270> lovely

big hind quarter you can enhance it with
the<00:00:31.020> patterns<00:00:31.860> now<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.579> start<00:00:33.210> off<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.359> I<00:00:33.600> use

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the patterns now I start off with I use

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.439 
the patterns now I start off with I use
a<00:00:33.809> product<00:00:34.170> called<00:00:34.379> water<00:00:34.829> glaze<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.210> wet

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
a product called water glaze and I wet

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:46.779 
a product called water glaze and I wet
the<00:00:36.659> area<00:00:36.839> I<00:00:44.479> then<00:00:45.479> use<00:00:45.749> a<00:00:45.780> very<00:00:46.109> fine<00:00:46.260> brush

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
the area I then use a very fine brush

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.770 
the area I then use a very fine brush
with<00:00:47.789> short<00:00:48.089> bristles<00:00:48.889> and<00:00:50.269> give<00:00:51.269> her<00:00:51.389> a<00:00:51.539> brush

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
with short bristles and give her a brush

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
with short bristles and give her a brush
over<00:00:52.229> I<00:00:52.909> have<00:00:53.909> a<00:00:53.940> lined<00:00:54.299> and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> center<00:00:55.199> here

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
over I have a lined and the center here

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.369 
over I have a lined and the center here
that<00:00:55.499> I<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:56.069> by<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.760> start<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.389> sharps<00:00:58.109> teeth

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that I go by I can start my sharps teeth

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.039 
that I go by I can start my sharps teeth
from<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.609> check<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.659> I<00:01:00.780> also

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
from and my check is and then I also

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.410 
from and my check is and then I also
brush<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.639> line<00:01:02.909> here

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
brush here and I will have a line here

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.399 
brush here and I will have a line here
so<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:08.430> start<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.479> I'll<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> couple<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so we start this is I'll do a couple of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.529 
so we start this is I'll do a couple of
different<00:01:10.469> patterns<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.789> start<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.360> at<00:01:12.509> the

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
different patterns we start up at the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.499 
different patterns we start up at the
top<00:01:12.649> by<00:01:13.649> brushing<00:01:14.039> down<00:01:14.399> we're<00:01:14.820> changing<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
top by brushing down we're changing the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
top by brushing down we're changing the
direction<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.560> hair<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.820> like

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
direction of the hair and it's like

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.599 
direction of the hair and it's like
velvet<00:01:18.329> on<00:01:18.719> a<00:01:18.780> lounge<00:01:19.109> suite<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.430> look

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
velvet on a lounge suite it will look

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.990 
velvet on a lounge suite it will look
darker<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.170> way<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.000> when

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
darker one way than another way so when

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760 
darker one way than another way so when
you<00:01:24.149> do<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.719> make<00:01:24.869> sure<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.500> line

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you do this you make sure that your line

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.120 
you do this you make sure that your line
across<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.939> straight<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> steel

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
across here is straight I use a steel

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.599 
across here is straight I use a steel
comb<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:31.109> bristles<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:32.070> quite

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
comb and the bristles are actually quite

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.730 
comb and the bristles are actually quite
strong<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> they've<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.869> rounded<00:01:34.320> ends<00:01:34.590> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
strong and they've got rounded ends so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.969 
strong and they've got rounded ends so
they<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.100> hurt<00:01:35.340> horse<00:01:36.140> from<00:01:37.140> my<00:01:37.289> first<00:01:37.590> line

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
they don't hurt horse from my first line

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.389 
they don't hurt horse from my first line
then<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.609> go<00:01:38.789> into<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.210> middle<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.280> do<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
then you go into the middle and do the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.200 
then you go into the middle and do the
next<00:01:41.579> line<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:43.469> you<00:01:43.560> keep<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> same

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
next line that and you keep it the same

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.749 
next line that and you keep it the same
length<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.689> way

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
length this way

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.980 
length this way
for<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> particular<00:01:48.240> pattern<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
for this particular pattern and then you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.410 
for this particular pattern and then you
just<00:01:52.259> repeat<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.039> process<00:01:55.969> until<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.270> as

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just repeat the process until you go as

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.599 
just repeat the process until you go as
far<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.929> like<00:01:58.109> to<00:01:58.319> go<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.799> all<00:01:59.069> very<00:01:59.369> much

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
far as you like to go it's all very much

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.480 
far as you like to go it's all very much
an<00:01:59.819> individual<00:02:00.420> process<00:02:01.069> just<00:02:02.069> make<00:02:02.249> that<00:02:02.369> one

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
an individual process just make that one

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.800 
an individual process just make that one
stand<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.030> more<00:02:05.119> if<00:02:06.119> your<00:02:06.329> horse<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.659> in

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
stand out a bit more if your horse is in

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
stand out a bit more if your horse is in
summer<00:02:07.049> coat<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.499> makes<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.280> easier<00:02:08.490> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
summer coat it makes it a lot easier to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.080 
summer coat it makes it a lot easier to
do<00:02:09.210> this<00:02:09.390> job

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.700 

so<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.450> many<00:02:13.780> different<00:02:13.960> variations

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
so you can do many different variations

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.970 
so you can do many different variations
of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> patterns<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> that's<00:02:20.440> one<00:02:20.710> pattern

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
of the patterns so that's one pattern

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
of the patterns so that's one pattern
finished<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.540> next<00:02:22.840> pattern<00:02:23.020> I'll<00:02:23.230> show<00:02:23.500> you

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
finished the next pattern I'll show you

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
finished the next pattern I'll show you
is<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.280> pattern<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.000> people<00:02:25.330> use

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
is a pattern that a lot of people use

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.300 
is a pattern that a lot of people use
for<00:02:25.540> their<00:02:25.840> riding<00:02:26.230> ponies<00:02:26.410> which<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.100> very

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
for their riding ponies which is very

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.390 
for their riding ponies which is very

much something that a lot of the English
ponies<00:02:31.120> are<00:02:31.720> using<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.410> for<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.770> one<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:34.390> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
ponies are using and for this one it's a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.410 
ponies are using and for this one it's a
lot<00:02:34.690> smaller<00:02:35.050> one<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.850> again<00:02:36.850> just<00:02:37.030> take<00:02:37.270> your

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
lot smaller one and again just take your

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.780 
lot smaller one and again just take your
time<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.990> lots<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.710> practice<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:39.580> one

time and lots of practice and this one

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.170 
time and lots of practice and this one
takes<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.450> while<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.970> don't<00:02:42.970> push<00:02:43.150> too

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
takes a while and just don't push too

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.160 
takes a while and just don't push too
hard<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.900> don't<00:02:44.140> upset<00:02:44.440> your<00:02:44.590> horse<00:02:44.830> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this again is a lot of practice and a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.450 
this again is a lot of practice and a
patient<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.750> for<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.680> particular<00:02:50.950> pattern

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
put this one on and again it's trial and

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.880 
put this one on and again it's trial and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
can see it makes that look bigger then

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.380 
can see it makes that look bigger then
what<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.230> do<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.860> do<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.370> pattern<00:03:36.940> called<00:03:37.300> a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
what we do is we do a pattern called a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.920 
what we do is we do a pattern called a
shark's<00:03:37.810> teeth<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:39.880> start<00:03:40.360> from<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.630> bottom

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
shark's teeth so I start from the bottom

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.870 
shark's teeth so I start from the bottom
and<00:03:41.050> again<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.590> process<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.490> moving

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
and again it's a process of just moving

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.050 
and again it's a process of just moving
the<00:03:43.000> hair<00:03:43.210> in<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.420> different<00:03:43.810> direction<00:03:45.060> people

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the hair in a different direction people

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.240 
the hair in a different direction people
can<00:03:46.210> start<00:03:46.450> from<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.840> top<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.890> can<00:03:47.920> make

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
can start from the top you can make

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.720 
can start from the top you can make
these<00:03:48.460> thinner<00:03:48.910> or<00:03:49.510> thicker<00:03:49.570> or<00:03:50.440> wider<00:03:50.730> again

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
these thinner or thicker or wider again

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.180 
these thinner or thicker or wider again
it's<00:03:52.390> practice<00:03:52.960> it's<00:03:53.290> what<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.650> like<00:03:53.860> on<00:03:54.070> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
it's practice it's what you like on the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.820 
it's practice it's what you like on the
horse<00:03:54.430> from<00:03:55.210> there<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.750> would<00:03:56.050> just<00:03:56.290> grab<00:03:56.560> some

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
horse from there I would just grab some

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.000 
horse from there I would just grab some
hair<00:03:57.070> spray<00:03:58.620> spray<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.770> coat<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:02.560> hold<00:04:02.740> it<00:04:02.890> in
