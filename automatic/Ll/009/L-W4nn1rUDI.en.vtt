ha hello everyone the US Postal Service
has<00:00:06.029> just<00:00:06.270> delivered<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:06.750> amazon<00:00:07.230> package<00:00:08.450> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
has just delivered an amazon package and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.499 
has just delivered an amazon package and
in<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.260> package<00:00:11.840> are<00:00:12.840> my<00:00:13.490> 27<00:00:14.490> watt<00:00:14.670> LED<00:00:15.210> work

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
in that package are my 27 watt LED work

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.330 
in that package are my 27 watt LED work
lights<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.400> look<00:00:17.850> like

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
lights and this is what they look like

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
lights and this is what they look like
it<00:00:20.340> says<00:00:20.670> LED<00:00:21.210> working<00:00:22.080> lamp<00:00:23.810> cast<00:00:24.810> aluminum

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it says LED working lamp cast aluminum

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700 
it says LED working lamp cast aluminum
housing<00:00:26.010> courts<00:00:26.789> lens<00:00:27.090> glass<00:00:28.080> service<00:00:28.560> with

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
housing courts lens glass service with

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.339 
housing courts lens glass service with
high<00:00:28.890> light<00:00:29.160> transmission<00:00:29.789> wide<00:00:30.720> open<00:00:31.109> volt

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
high light transmission wide open volt

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
high light transmission wide open volt
operating<00:00:32.040> voltage<00:00:32.460> range<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.090> low<00:00:33.239> heat

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
operating voltage range and low heat

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.630 
operating voltage range and low heat
output<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> 30<00:00:38.820> degree<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.480> says

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
output so this is the 30 degree it says

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
output so this is the 30 degree it says
30<00:00:41.640> degree<00:00:42.000> round<00:00:42.649> 27<00:00:43.649> volt<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> apparently

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
30 degree round 27 volt so apparently

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.299 
30 degree round 27 volt so apparently
you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:48.649> 60<00:00:49.649> degree<00:00:49.739> too<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you can get a 60 degree too so this is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
you can get a 60 degree too so this is
supposed<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> narrower<00:00:54.239> beam<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
supposed to be the narrower beam and it
does<00:00:55.320> seem<00:00:55.530> narrower<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> item

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
know the only gimmick here is this box i

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.310 
know the only gimmick here is this box i
paid<00:04:15.830> about<00:04:16.420> $35<00:04:17.420> for<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:19.840> but<00:04:20.840> i<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.080> hang

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
paid about $35 for this but i can hang

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.860 
paid about $35 for this but i can hang
this<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:21.890> underneath<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:25.630> transom<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
this just underneath the transom of the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.830 
this just underneath the transom of the
boat<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.850> has<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.950> plug<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.630> through<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
boat and it has a plug in through the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.410 
boat and it has a plug in through the
box<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.340> i<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.580> plug<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.970> in<00:04:35.060> right<00:04:35.090> through

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.710 
box so i can plug it in right through
the<00:04:35.510> box<00:04:35.750> for<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> light<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.360> we'll<00:04:38.510> see<00:04:38.690> how

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
the box for the light so we'll see how

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.330 
the box for the light so we'll see how
that<00:04:38.810> works<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.560> 12<00:04:39.860> volt<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:42.170> 12<00:04:42.620> volt<00:04:42.890> is

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
that works it's 12 volt the 12 volt is

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.290 
that works it's 12 volt the 12 volt is
what<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:43.760> need<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:45.830> important<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:47.030> comes

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
what we need so it's important it comes

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.480 
what we need so it's important it comes
with<00:04:47.770> comes<00:04:48.770> with<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.040> cable<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.930> plug<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.530> you

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490

with comes with a cable to plug in you
plug<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.030> charger<00:04:53.060> here<00:04:53.870> into<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:55.570> you

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
plug the charger here into this you

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.640 
plug the charger here into this you
never<00:04:56.750> have<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:56.990> take<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.260> battery<00:04:57.560> out<00:04:57.590> and
