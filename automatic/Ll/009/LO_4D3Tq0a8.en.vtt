1.07 as most people column so people
have<00:00:14.759> been<00:00:14.880> saying<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.450> for<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.690> next

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
have been saying that for the next

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.840 
have been saying that for the next
update<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.710> 4g<00:00:17.070> seduce<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> actually<00:00:17.730> going

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
update that 4g seduce is actually going

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
update that 4g seduce is actually going
to<00:00:17.940> combine<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.660> minecraft<00:00:19.439> equivalent<00:00:19.949> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
to combine the minecraft equivalent of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
to combine the minecraft equivalent of
the<00:00:20.160> pretty<00:00:20.400> scary<00:00:20.760> update<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> redstone

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the pretty scary update and the redstone

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.929 
the pretty scary update and the redstone
update<00:00:21.990> together<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.070> make<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> next<00:00:23.670> update

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
update together to make the next update

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.210 
update together to make the next update
so<00:00:24.539> actually<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> super<00:00:25.890> huge

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so actually this is a super huge

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.769 
so actually this is a super huge
possibility<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.090> think<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.449> most

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
possibility like I think this is most

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
possibility like I think this is most
likely<00:00:28.019> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> happen<00:00:28.710> mostly<00:00:29.429> because<00:00:29.460> we

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
likely going to happen mostly because we

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.550 
likely going to happen mostly because we
already<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> things<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.109> both

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
already have a lot of things from both

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
already have a lot of things from both
of<00:00:31.590> these<00:00:31.769> updates<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of these updates and like I so the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
of these updates and like I so the
pretty<00:00:34.200> scary<00:00:34.469> update<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.250> was

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
pretty scary update was one was

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.250 
pretty scary update was one was
equivalent<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.420> earth<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
equivalent to one earth was the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
equivalent to one earth was the
equipment<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> next<00:00:38.129> update<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.550> one

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
equipment to the next update which one

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
equipment to the next update which one
coming<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.480> 1.4<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.680> don't

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
coming so it was 1.4 so if you don't

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
coming so it was 1.4 so if you don't
know<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.550> 14<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> last<00:00:42.629> update

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
know to 14 which was the last update

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
know to 14 which was the last update
that<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:43.500> added<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.829> new<00:00:43.980> features<00:00:44.340> was

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that actually added in new features was

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750 
that actually added in new features was
called<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.239> 14<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
called to 14 and so like and now is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
called to 14 and so like and now is
equivalent<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.320> 1.3<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> next<00:00:50.219> one

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
equivalent to 1.3 so then the next one

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.729 
equivalent to 1.3 so then the next one
will<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.550> 1.4<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.329> PC<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.719> has<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> pretty

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
will be 1.4 on PC and has the pretty

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
will be 1.4 on PC and has the pretty
scary<00:00:52.980> update<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> has<00:00:53.809> beacons<00:00:54.809> carrots

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
don't know like a lot of those things

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
don't know like a lot of those things
were<00:01:12.720> added<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> last<00:01:13.320> update<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
were added in the last update but up you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
were added in the last update but up you
know<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> weather<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.509> witch<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
know like the weather the witch with a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.230 
know like the weather the witch with a
skeleton<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.189> ball<00:01:17.400> though<00:01:18.320> bats<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.740> bad

skeleton the ball though bats my bad

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.300

those<00:01:21.240> things<00:01:21.450> weren't<00:01:21.689> added<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> do

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
those things weren't added in so I do

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.710 
those things weren't added in so I do
think<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> next<00:01:24.090> update<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.509> easy

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
think that the next update would be easy

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
think that the next update would be easy
just<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.380> push<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:25.890> over<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
just as you know push them over to it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.780 
just as you know push them over to it
and<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> redstone<00:01:27.720> update<00:01:27.750> added<00:01:28.290> in

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and in the redstone update added in

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
and in the redstone update added in
comparator<00:01:29.790> topper<00:01:30.689> dropper<00:01:31.530> daylight

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
courts and courts than things you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
courts and courts than things you can
make<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.869> quartz<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.920> since<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.159> already

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
make with quartz so since we already

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.319 
make with quartz so since we already
have<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> courts<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.000> that's<00:01:42.180> another

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
have the courts like that's another

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
have the courts like that's another
thing<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.930> took<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> piece<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
thing like they took like a piece out of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.969 
thing like they took like a piece out of
that<00:01:44.399> update<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that update so I think it's like a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.550 
that update so I think it's like a
natural<00:01:47.579> thing<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.750> add<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.259> rest<00:01:49.380> room

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
natural thing to just add the rest room

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170 
natural thing to just add the rest room
together<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> them<00:01:50.610> into<00:01:50.909> their<00:01:51.060> own

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
together and make it them into their own

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.690 
together and make it them into their own
update<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.770> essentially

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
update and if I do that then essentially

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.600 
update and if I do that then essentially
there's<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.149> skipping<00:01:54.600> an<00:01:54.840> update<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
there's like skipping an update so that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.859 
there's like skipping an update so that
actually<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.909> help<00:01:57.090> help<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.540> catch<00:01:57.719> up

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
actually would help help them catch up

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
actually would help help them catch up
with<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> PC<00:01:58.320> quicker<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.149> know

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
with a PC quicker and also I do know

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.539 
with a PC quicker and also I do know
that<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.890> guilty<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that like I'm guilty this too is it

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
that like I'm guilty this too is it
putting<00:02:03.060> out<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> lot<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> horse<00:02:03.689> information

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
putting out a lot of horse information

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.469 
putting out a lot of horse information
because<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.500> people<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.340> horses<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.240> bad

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
because I know people want horses so bad

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
because I know people want horses so bad
and<00:02:06.719> I'm<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.110> joy<00:02:07.560> knows<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.190> 4g

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and I'm sure for joy knows this to 4g

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
and I'm sure for joy knows this to 4g
hands<00:02:09.239> are<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.450> good<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.500> good

thing<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.890> could<00:02:10.950> say<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.489> Jays

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
thing I could say out for Jays

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.720 
thing I could say out for Jays
they're<00:02:12.630> really<00:02:12.750> good<00:02:13.230> at<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:14.010> sin<00:02:14.490> or

thinking what we really want and I don't

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.400 
thinking what we really want and I don't
always<00:02:17.610> give<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.090> us<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.840> they<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.020> act

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
always give it to us but they do act

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.690 
always give it to us but they do act
like<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:19.980> good<00:02:20.160> thing<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> they<00:02:20.459> bring

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
like that's one good thing is they bring

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.300 
like that's one good thing is they bring
things<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.050> we<00:02:22.200> want<00:02:22.380> from<00:02:22.980> future

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
things they know we want from future

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.340 
things they know we want from future
updates<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> say<00:02:24.900> she<00:02:24.959> ate<00:02:25.230> our

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
updates like to kind of say she ate our

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.350 
updates like to kind of say she ate our
appetites<00:02:25.860> into<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.280> next<00:02:26.490> update<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> do

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
appetites into the next update so I do

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120 
appetites into the next update so I do
think<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> huge<00:02:27.810> possibility<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.770> horses

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
think is a huge possibility that horses

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
think is a huge possibility that horses
are<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.120> their<00:02:30.300> horses

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
are you know going to be in their horses

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
are you know going to be in their horses
saddles<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.280> leads<00:02:32.550> i<00:02:32.760> guess<00:02:32.940> would<00:02:33.060> be

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
saddles and the leads i guess would be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
saddles and the leads i guess would be
like<00:02:33.540> would<00:02:33.690> come<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> horses<00:02:34.320> just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
like would come with the horses just

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.830 
like would come with the horses just
because<00:02:35.580> they<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.120> people<00:02:36.510> been

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
because they know that people been

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.040 
because they know that people been
crying<00:02:37.410> out<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.680> horses<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.670> badly<00:02:39.020> okay<00:02:40.020> i

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
like it's been spreading throughout

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.110

super<00:02:48.780> huge<00:02:49.020> possibility<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:49.680> gonna<00:02:49.830> be

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
super huge possibility that's gonna be
