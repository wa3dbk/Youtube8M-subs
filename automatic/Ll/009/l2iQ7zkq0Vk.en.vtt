00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
can't drill under the frame well I just

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.870 
can't drill under the frame well I just
do<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.650> way<00:02:48.800> cuz<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.250> they<00:02:49.400> plug<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.790> up

do it that way cuz that they plug it up

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.110 
do it that way cuz that they plug it up
from<00:02:50.060> strength<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.610> I'm<00:02:52.610> gonna<00:02:52.730> get<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.000> two

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
from strength so I'm gonna get the two

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170 
from strength so I'm gonna get the two
tabs<00:02:53.360> there<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:54.019> might<00:02:54.470> end<00:02:54.739> early<00:02:54.860> put<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.760> one

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
tabs there I might end early put in one

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.640 
tabs there I might end early put in one
right<00:02:56.300> here<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.810> know<00:02:56.959> runs<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:57.410> that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
right here that you know runs from that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.220 
right here that you know runs from that
and<00:02:58.549> comes<00:02:58.850> back<00:02:59.150> something<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:02.230> but

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
and comes back something like that but

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.440 
and comes back something like that but
this<00:03:03.739> tat<00:03:04.100> these<00:03:04.370> tabs<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.090> dirt<00:03:05.239> bike

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
this tat these tabs on the dirt bike

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
this tat these tabs on the dirt bike
were<00:03:05.600> broke<00:03:05.840> off<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.769> was<00:03:06.799> doing<00:03:07.220> just

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
were broke off and it was doing just

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.610 
were broke off and it was doing just
fine<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.580> thousand<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.540> figured<00:03:09.350> that'd<00:03:09.470> be

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
fine a thousand but I figured that'd be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.240 
fine a thousand but I figured that'd be
good<00:03:09.739> for<00:03:09.980> now<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:11.500> they<00:03:12.500> got<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> little

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
good for now but they got a little

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.050 
good for now but they got a little
square<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.820> up<00:03:13.940> with<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.860> with<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.890> frame<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
square it up with the with the frame and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.500 
square it up with the with the frame and
the<00:03:17.150> rear<00:03:17.299> axle<00:03:17.630> everything<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:20.299> know

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
the rear axle everything so you know

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.180 
the rear axle everything so you know
they<00:03:20.660> got<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.320> can<00:03:21.500> place<00:03:21.709> my<00:03:21.920> feet

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
they got that and I can place my feet

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.430 
they got that and I can place my feet
and<00:03:22.370> once<00:03:22.549> they<00:03:22.640> get<00:03:22.760> my<00:03:22.940> seat<00:03:23.150> place<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.320> I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
and once they get my seat place then I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.350
