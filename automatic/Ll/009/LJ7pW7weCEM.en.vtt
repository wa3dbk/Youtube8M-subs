points down on my governor's race in
1998<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.129> didn't<00:01:05.339> give<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.939> was

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
1998 we just didn't give up that was

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
1998 we just didn't give up that was
three<00:01:06.270> weeks<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:06.900> didn't<00:01:07.229> give<00:01:07.350> up

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
