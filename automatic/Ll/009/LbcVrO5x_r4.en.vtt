something<00:00:17.430> you'll<00:00:17.520> probably<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.880> tackle

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
something you'll probably have to tackle

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150 
something you'll probably have to tackle
every<00:00:18.690> race<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.320> once<00:00:19.590> every<00:00:19.740> 20<00:00:20.130> years

every race not just once every 20 years

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
every race not just once every 20 years
now<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.150> difficult<00:00:21.570> skill<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> master

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
now it's not difficult skill to master

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.050 
now it's not difficult skill to master
but<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.800> need<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
but you do need to know how to do it the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550 
but you do need to know how to do it the
right<00:00:24.240> way<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.990> should<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.199> start<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
right way we should we start with a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
right way we should we start with a
dismount<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.220> absolutely<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> aim<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
dismount first absolutely the aim of the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
dismount first absolutely the aim of the
dismount<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.590> off<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.859> bike<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
dismount is to get off your bike and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
dismount is to get off your bike and
then<00:00:29.340> seamlessly<00:00:29.670> start<00:00:30.390> running<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.170> key

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
then seamlessly start running the key

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.229 
then seamlessly start running the key
thing<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.219> things<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.579> cyclocross<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
thing like all things in cyclocross is

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
thing like all things in cyclocross is
to<00:00:33.360> conserve<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.780> momentum<00:00:34.410> you've<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to conserve your momentum you've got to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.319 
to conserve your momentum you've got to
work<00:00:34.950> hard<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> build<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.790> speed<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
work hard to build up speed and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.670 
work hard to build up speed and
therefore<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> bear<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.649> mind

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
therefore you need to bear it in mind

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
therefore you need to bear it in mind
when<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.370> getting<00:00:38.550> off<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.850> bike<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.780> want

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
when you getting off your bike you want

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
when you getting off your bike you want
to<00:00:39.989> practice<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.469> technique<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> flat

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to practice this technique on a flat

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
to practice this technique on a flat
stretch<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.030> grass<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.540> there's<00:00:42.750> nothing<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
stretch of grass so there's nothing to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.770 
stretch of grass so there's nothing to
avoid<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.770> stop<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.250> adjust<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.360> speed<00:00:45.570> to

often the releasing your pedals just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
often the releasing your pedals just
gets<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> little<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.159> hit-and-miss<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.060> taking

the top tube just gives you that little
bit<00:02:03.119> more<00:02:03.299> time<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.500> foot

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
bit more time to get that right foot

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
bit more time to get that right foot
down<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> left<00:02:05.369> foot<00:02:05.520> unclipped<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.509> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
if it is a little bit stuck and there

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
if it is a little bit stuck and there
you<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.550> struggle<00:02:08.819> sometimes<00:02:09.239> you're

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you do struggle sometimes you're

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.219

clipping<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.780> unclipping

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
clipping and unclipping

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.960 
clipping and unclipping
this<00:02:10.890> will<00:02:11.129> help<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.760> lot

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
it it's just for a short period of time

bike<00:02:50.980> down<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.430> interesting<00:02:51.820> case<00:02:51.970> of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
bike down is interesting case of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.330 
bike down is interesting case of
reversing<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.720> process<00:02:53.070> popping<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you just want to place it so you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.310 
you just want to place it so you

you've got those dialed it's then time

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.820 
you've got those dialed it's then time
to<00:03:01.540> start<00:03:01.810> thinking<00:03:01.959> about<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.620> rebound<00:03:04.830> okay

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
to start thinking about the rebound okay

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.650 
to start thinking about the rebound okay
so<00:03:06.130> first<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.030> all<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.209> want<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.390> be<00:03:07.450> holding

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
so first of all you want to be holding

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.680 
so first of all you want to be holding
bars<00:03:08.050> on<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.740> hoods<00:03:09.490> or<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> tops<00:03:10.240> okay<00:03:10.630> to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
bars on the hoods or on the tops okay to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.150 
bars on the hoods or on the tops okay to
learn<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.020> think<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:11.440> all<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.740> on<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.890> tops

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
learn I think we all do it on the tops

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.760 
learn I think we all do it on the tops
it<00:03:12.580> makes<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> little<00:03:13.000> bit<00:03:13.150> easier

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
it makes it a little bit easier

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.840 
it makes it a little bit easier
basically<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.920> don't<00:03:15.010> want<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.250> jump<00:03:15.520> back

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
basically you don't want to jump back

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.280 
basically you don't want to jump back
onto<00:03:16.030> bike<00:03:16.360> even<00:03:16.630> when<00:03:16.750> you're<00:03:16.870> running<00:03:17.020> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
onto bike even when you're running it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.590 
onto bike even when you're running it
should<00:03:17.560> feel<00:03:17.800> like<00:03:17.980> more<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> slide<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.540> you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
should feel like more of a slide so you

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.930 
should feel like more of a slide so you
start<00:03:19.959> simply<00:03:20.470> by<00:03:20.650> bringing<00:03:21.250> your<00:03:21.520> right<00:03:21.550> leg

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
start simply by bringing your right leg

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.600 
start simply by bringing your right leg
over<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.209> back<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.660> bike<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.140> then<00:03:23.950> you

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
over the back of the bike and then you

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.240 
over the back of the bike and then you
sort<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:26.020> should<00:03:26.230> step<00:03:26.530> over<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.190> you

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
sort of you should step over it and you

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.830 
sort of you should step over it and you
want<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.430> land<00:03:27.730> on<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> top<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.510> your<00:03:28.570> thigh

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
want to land on the top of your thigh

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.330 
want to land on the top of your thigh
that's<00:03:29.200> from<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.440> thigh<00:03:29.590> that's<00:03:29.920> really

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
that's from the thigh that's really

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.500 
that's from the thigh that's really
important<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.820> land<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.030> top<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.269> your<00:03:31.360> thigh

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
important to land on top of your thigh

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.900 
important to land on top of your thigh
and<00:03:31.690> then<00:03:32.019> your<00:03:32.140> momentum<00:03:32.590> from<00:03:32.800> running<00:03:33.190> just

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and then your momentum from running just

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.030 
and then your momentum from running just
puts<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.300> back<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.780> seat<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.230> away<00:03:36.010> you

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
puts you back in the seat and away you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.330 
puts you back in the seat and away you
go

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
go

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.780 
go
you<00:03:36.640> slide<00:03:36.970> across<00:03:37.269> now<00:03:38.280> ultimately<00:03:39.280> we're

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you slide across now ultimately we're

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
you slide across now ultimately we're
going<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> do<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.330> running<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.019> learn

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
going to do it from running but to learn

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.229 
going to do it from running but to learn
I<00:03:41.500> think<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.860> important<00:03:42.190> thing<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.910> do<00:03:43.150> it

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
I think the important thing is to do it

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.479 
I think the important thing is to do it
from<00:03:43.300> stationary<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.920> it's<00:03:45.160> just<00:03:45.280> simply

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
from stationary and so it's just simply

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.310 
from stationary and so it's just simply
a<00:03:45.640> case<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:45.880> pushing<00:03:46.690> off<00:03:46.780> with<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.080> left

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
a case of pushing off with this left

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.190 
a case of pushing off with this left
foot<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.769> then<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:49.390> kind<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.630> going<00:03:49.959> for<00:03:50.140> it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
foot and then just kind of going for it

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.339 
foot and then just kind of going for it
really

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.199 

yeah<00:03:56.810> yeah<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.310> have<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.579> look<00:03:59.760> at<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.969> all

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
yeah yeah so so have a look at the all

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.970 
yeah yeah so so have a look at the all
the<00:04:00.329> component<00:04:00.810> parts<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.200> getting<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.709> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the component parts of getting on and

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.000 
the component parts of getting on and
getting<00:04:02.370> off<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:03.150> bike<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.680> guess<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.920> going

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
getting off the bike I guess it's going

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.920 
getting off the bike I guess it's going
to<00:04:05.069> take<00:04:05.249> me<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.639> bit<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.939> time<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.389> get<00:04:06.780> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to take me a bit of time to get it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.720 
to take me a bit of time to get it
pretty<00:04:07.079> polished<00:04:07.349> but<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.920> guess<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.370> also<00:04:08.489> need

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
pretty polished but I guess I also need

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.339 
pretty polished but I guess I also need
to<00:04:08.819> sew<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.180> all<00:04:09.269> together<00:04:09.359> as<00:04:09.719> well<00:04:09.870> actually

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
to sew it all together as well actually

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.050 
to sew it all together as well actually
you<00:04:10.769> got<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:10.980> practice<00:04:11.129> ultimately<00:04:11.879> with

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you got to practice ultimately with

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.759 
you got to practice ultimately with
these<00:04:12.180> things<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.840> does<00:04:13.019> take<00:04:13.200> time<00:04:13.379> to<00:04:13.439> get

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
these things it does take time to get

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.110 
these things it does take time to get
the<00:04:13.889> skills<00:04:14.129> dialed<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.639> get<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.879> smooth

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the skills dialed and to get it smooth

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.270 
the skills dialed and to get it smooth
then<00:04:15.359> you<00:04:15.689> also<00:04:15.810> can't<00:04:16.199> forget<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:17.009> if

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
then you also can't forget that if

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.469 
then you also can't forget that if
you're<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.759> get<00:04:17.849> on<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.060> off<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.299> bike

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
you're going to get on and off your bike

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.449 
you're going to get on and off your bike
that's<00:04:18.660> be<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> purpose<00:04:19.199> for<00:04:19.380> as<00:04:19.500> well<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.160> in

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that's be a purpose for as well so in

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.430 
that's be a purpose for as well so in
short<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.299> want<00:04:21.509> to<00:04:21.599> be<00:04:21.690> off<00:04:21.840> your<00:04:21.870> bike<00:04:22.259> and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
short you want to be off your bike and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.990 
short you want to be off your bike and
running<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.130> shortest<00:04:23.639> amount<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.940> time

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
running for the shortest amount of time

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.890 
running for the shortest amount of time
possible

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
possible

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.050 
possible
however<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.099> later<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.490> leave<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.849> before

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
however the later you leave it before

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180 
however the later you leave it before
the<00:04:27.150> obstacle<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.599> harder<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.020> gets<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
the obstacle the harder it gets as a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.370 
the obstacle the harder it gets as a
rough<00:04:29.520> guide<00:04:29.550> around<00:04:30.030> four<00:04:30.509> strides<00:04:30.870> before

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
rough guide around four strides before

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.839 
rough guide around four strides before
and<00:04:31.500> after<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.770> obstacle<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.280> about<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
and after the obstacle is about the

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.879 
and after the obstacle is about the
maximum<00:04:33.449> you<00:04:33.539> want<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.750> leave<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.169> ideally

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
maximum you want to leave it and ideally

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.730 
maximum you want to leave it and ideally
it's<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.430> short<00:04:35.729> -<00:04:36.289> sometimes<00:04:37.289> whatever<00:04:37.440> after

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
it's a short - sometimes whatever after

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.409 
it's a short - sometimes whatever after
the<00:04:37.919> obstacle<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.460> might<00:04:38.849> not<00:04:39.030> actually<00:04:39.180> be

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
the obstacle you might not actually be

able to get straight back on it just

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.700 
able to get straight back on it just
depends<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:41.729> your<00:04:41.789> speed<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.599> terrain<00:04:42.990> it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
depends on your speed and the terrain it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.230 
depends on your speed and the terrain it
might<00:04:43.919> be<00:04:44.099> quicker<00:04:44.370> therefore<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.910> carry<00:04:45.120> on

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
might be quicker therefore to carry on

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.730 
might be quicker therefore to carry on
running<00:04:45.389> for<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.690> little<00:04:45.870> bit<00:04:45.960> longer<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.440> then

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
running for a little bit longer and then

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.620 
running for a little bit longer and then
jump<00:04:46.979> back<00:04:47.099> on<00:04:47.250> later<00:04:47.490> there's<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.150> golden<00:04:48.449> rule

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
jump back on later there's a golden rule

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.839 
jump back on later there's a golden rule
if<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.320> slower<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.889> ride<00:04:50.099> than<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.639> run

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849

perhaps<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.870> want<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.080> consider<00:04:52.349> running<00:04:52.560> as

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
perhaps you want to consider running as

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.860 
perhaps you want to consider running as
your<00:04:52.919> option<00:04:53.099> real<00:04:53.910> top<00:04:54.120> guys<00:04:54.300> who's<00:04:54.509> running

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
your option real top guys who's running

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.749 
your option real top guys who's running
is<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.020> viable<00:04:55.289> alternative<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.979> riding<00:04:56.430> mainly

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
is a viable alternative to riding mainly

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.040 
is a viable alternative to riding mainly
because<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.060> process<00:04:57.539> of<00:04:57.630> getting<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:57.930> and

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
because the process of getting on and

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.930 
because the process of getting on and
off<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:58.590> slick<00:04:58.919> they<00:04:59.310> don't<00:04:59.490> actually<00:04:59.639> lose

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
off is so slick they don't actually lose

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.390 
off is so slick they don't actually lose
any<00:05:00.180> time<00:05:00.570> at<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:00.990> anywhere<00:05:01.949> they're<00:05:02.130> slowing

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
any time at all anywhere they're slowing

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.640 
any time at all anywhere they're slowing
down<00:05:02.639> they<00:05:03.000> jump<00:05:03.300> off<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.720> they<00:05:03.960> run<00:05:04.199> it's

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
down they jump off and they run it's

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.439 
down they jump off and they run it's
tough<00:05:04.919> but<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:05.729> worth<00:05:06.030> trying<00:05:06.060> to

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
tough but it's worth trying to

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.210 
tough but it's worth trying to
incorporate<00:05:06.690> bits<00:05:07.440> of<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.770> into<00:05:08.099> your
