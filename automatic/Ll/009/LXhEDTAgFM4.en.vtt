00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.370
 any case, the fleet is to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 Both consoles have a few hours for you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 be online 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 so again at this point if 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 you all respect this action 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.470
 that we do not have the consoles for hours 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.750
 we can use others 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 to make videos for that please like 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 a thumb up there then we see 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.369
 also that we are next week again 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.350
 we should have already seen 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.430
 Two weeks ago, the whole thing came somehow 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.270
 a little better 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.470
 that's why people raped raped 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 the like button 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.310
 I like to do that and above all 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 write in the comments if we 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 that should continue to do and also 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.890
 your gamer tags so we can see if it is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.630
 at all people are on it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 depending if there are some 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 comments and likes are see each other 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.369
 then there, as I said 19 clock to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 maybe even 10 pm that will happen 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.170
 on how high the rush in the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 comments and in the same 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.189
 Visually otherwise we would 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.439
 We'll be happy to see you at the gorgon 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.850
 Labyrinth would see flow going on 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.479
 every case at the start its people again 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.890
 only subscribers are allowed to do that practically 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.140
 use that's why we only take 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360
 subscribers in the list of friends on the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.789
 playstation for that reason 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 talk to us on the consoles the gamer 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.090
 finds tags 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.290
 as I said in the channel info the gamer 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
 text still a bit different 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 at the playstation lacks learning 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.200
 sign on the xbox is in it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 Talk and write us in the comments 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.270
 and then you can barn 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 depending on how good the resonance is below 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.680
 this video is also in the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.110
 next week even on Tuesdays 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.569
 maybe even at 10 o'clock already the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.519
 distribute checkpoint this is up to you 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.440
 how high the resonance is the better 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.670
 Distribute for you more often with 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 which even maybe even weekly 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.810
 again on friday on thursday i 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.940
 I have no idea that is all alone 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.590
 to you you have it in hand that has 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.780
 also nothing with somehow like cool or 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.400
 what I do people think about it 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.080
 which will not be advertising 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.790
 to earn a few thousand euros 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.769
 but could not do it because 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.319
 we want you to be free here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.060
 entertainment have advertising free 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.680
 People from the beginning 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.540
 a bit we are following the know 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.400
 the audience is very close to our hearts 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.560
 that we only have this channel 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.510
 because of which operate because of the quiet 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.370
 a lighter back to us 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.260
 give because we really see if 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.940
 we should continue to do it and in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.680
 like again and again and we look forward to it 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.680
 say to the next video people
