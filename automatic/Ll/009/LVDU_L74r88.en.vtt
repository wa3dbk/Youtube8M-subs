lot of planning around corners here to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.640 
lot of planning around corners here to

was an extremely loose car on throttle
you<00:03:16.420> didn't<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:17.710> know<00:03:17.890> when<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.400> was<00:03:18.520> going

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you didn't really know when it was going

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.640 
you didn't really know when it was going
to<00:03:18.730> step<00:03:19.000> out<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.360> when<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.600> did<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:19.930> happened

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
to step out and when it did it happened

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.560 
to step out and when it did it happened
like<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.830> binary<00:03:21.280> situation<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.210> was<00:03:22.360> like

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
like a binary situation it was like

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.480 
like a binary situation it was like
you're<00:03:22.780> going<00:03:22.960> fine<00:03:23.290> you're<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.650> fine<00:03:23.980> all

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
of us on the tails out and when it's out

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
of us on the tails out and when it's out
you<00:03:26.620> need<00:03:26.770> very<00:03:27.010> very<00:03:27.460> quick<00:03:27.730> hands<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.240> very

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
you need very very quick hands and very

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.080 
you need very very quick hands and very
careful<00:03:28.960> throttle<00:03:29.290> control<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:30.400> car<00:03:30.670> still

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
careful throttle control this car still

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.620 
careful throttle control this car still
the<00:03:31.330> same<00:03:31.630> thing<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.440> may<00:03:32.950> be<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.220> little<00:03:33.630> less

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
the same thing it may be a little less

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.690 
the same thing it may be a little less
like<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:35.020> but<00:03:35.590> still<00:03:35.890> when<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.460> thing

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
like that but still when this thing

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.040 
like that but still when this thing
loses<00:03:37.630> grip<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.350> goes<00:03:38.560> very<00:03:38.890> very<00:03:39.250> quickly

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
loses grip it goes very very quickly

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.200 
loses grip it goes very very quickly
the<00:03:41.590> way<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.890> drives<00:03:42.130> though<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:42.760> strange

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
the way it drives though is so strange

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.820 
the way it drives though is so strange
because<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.690> look<00:03:43.960> at<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.200> car<00:03:44.530> from<00:03:44.650> the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
because you look at this car from the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.370 
because you look at this car from the
outside<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.520> see<00:03:45.550> its<00:03:45.970> long<00:03:46.630> nose<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.230> mean

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
outside you see its long nose I mean

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.290 
outside you see its long nose I mean
from<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> interior<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.250> hood<00:03:48.730> looks<00:03:49.120> like

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
from the interior this hood looks like

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.740 
from the interior this hood looks like
it<00:03:49.450> ends<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.780> Texas<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.760> doesn't<00:03:52.390> drive

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
it ends in Texas but it doesn't drive

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.990 
it ends in Texas but it doesn't drive
like<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.560> way<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.830> looks<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.280> imagine<00:03:54.910> this

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
like the way it looks you imagine this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.540 
like the way it looks you imagine this
is<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.210> front-engine<00:03:55.660> rear-drive<00:03:56.440> car<00:03:57.070> it's

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
is a front-engine rear-drive car it's

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.790 
is a front-engine rear-drive car it's
going<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.820> have<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> front<00:03:58.360> weight<00:03:58.810> bias<00:03:59.560> it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
going to have a front weight bias it's

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.230 
going to have a front weight bias it's
going<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.220> most<00:04:00.430> its<00:04:00.670> weight<00:04:00.880> over<00:04:01.120> them

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
going to have most its weight over them

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.690 
going to have most its weight over them
on<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> front<00:04:01.690> axle<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.860> should<00:04:03.280> feel

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
on the front axle it's a should feel

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.960 
on the front axle it's a should feel
like<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> muscle<00:04:04.450> car<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:05.290> doesn't<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.460> in<00:04:06.670> fact

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
like a muscle car it doesn't it in fact

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.160 
like a muscle car it doesn't it in fact
has<00:04:07.210> a<00:04:07.240> rear<00:04:07.600> weight<00:04:07.900> bias<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.400> drives

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
has a rear weight bias and so it drives

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.500 
has a rear weight bias and so it drives
kind<00:04:11.170> of<00:04:11.380> like<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.710> mid-engine<00:04:12.430> car<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.120> so

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
kind of like a mid-engine car and so

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.380 
kind of like a mid-engine car and so
that's<00:04:13.750> why<00:04:14.020> when<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.740> rear<00:04:14.920> tires<00:04:15.220> slip<00:04:15.760> the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
that's why when the rear tires slip the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.060 
that's why when the rear tires slip the
core<00:04:16.660> car<00:04:16.900> goes<00:04:17.170> very<00:04:17.380> quickly<00:04:17.739> because

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
core car goes very quickly because

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.520 
core car goes very quickly because
that's<00:04:18.250> what<00:04:18.489> mid-engine<00:04:19.450> cars<00:04:19.690> tend<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.020> do

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
that's what mid-engine cars tend to do

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.790 
that's what mid-engine cars tend to do
chassis<00:04:22.400> aside<00:04:22.820> though<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.270> engine<00:04:23.810> oh<00:04:23.930> this

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
chassis aside though this engine oh this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.460 
chassis aside though this engine oh this
engine<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.400> awesome<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.650> sound<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.460> makes<00:04:28.700> is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
engine is awesome the sound it makes is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.080 
engine is awesome the sound it makes is
absolutely<00:04:30.470> phenomenal<00:04:30.740> when<00:04:31.580> you're<00:04:31.730> hard

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
absolutely phenomenal when you're hard

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.810 
absolutely phenomenal when you're hard
on<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.360> gas<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.320> grab<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> big<00:04:34.130> downshift

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
on the gas and you grab a big downshift
