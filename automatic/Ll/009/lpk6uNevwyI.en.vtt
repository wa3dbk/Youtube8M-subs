not like sticking in your skin and you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:52.180 
not like sticking in your skin and you
should<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.180> fine

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.670 

okay<00:02:52.940> now<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> other<00:02:54.170> side<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:57.080> generally

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
okay now the other side you generally

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.040 
okay now the other side you generally
just<00:02:57.710> do<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.250> same<00:02:58.430> thing<00:02:58.490> again<00:02:59.240> it<00:02:59.810> doesn't

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
just do the same thing again it doesn't

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.140 
just do the same thing again it doesn't
have<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.740> 100%<00:03:01.190> perfect<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.030> doesn't

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
have to be you 100% perfect it doesn't

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.050 
have to be you 100% perfect it doesn't
have<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.480> be<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:03.410> way<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.770> other<00:03:03.950> side<00:03:04.280> is

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.210 

because<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.410> doesn't<00:03:09.620> work<00:03:09.800> out<00:03:09.980> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
because it just doesn't work out that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.380 
because it just doesn't work out that
way<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> end<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.120> won't<00:03:11.180> matter

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
way and in the end it won't matter

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:30.339 
way and in the end it won't matter
anyway

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.520 

if<00:03:30.829> your<00:03:31.040> hair<00:03:31.310> gets<00:03:31.670> damaged<00:03:32.239> easy<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:33.200> don't

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
if your hair gets damaged easy I don't

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.679 
if your hair gets damaged easy I don't
know<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.010> would<00:03:34.189> necessarily<00:03:34.510> suggest<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
know if I would necessarily suggest the

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.929 
know if I would necessarily suggest the
style<00:03:36.730> because<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.489> mean<00:03:40.790> it's

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
style because it is it's I mean it's

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.789 
style because it is it's I mean it's
it's<00:03:41.209> kind<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.510> not<00:03:41.719> good<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.049> your<00:03:42.170> hair<00:03:42.379> for

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.349 
it's kind of not good for your hair for
some<00:03:42.950> reason<00:03:43.280> my<00:03:43.519> hair<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.849> actually<00:03:43.999> pretty

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
nice hopefully that didn't just like

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.830 
nice hopefully that didn't just like
jinx<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.430> or<00:03:46.519> whatever<00:03:46.760> well<00:03:47.480> my<00:03:47.569> hair<00:03:47.750> is

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
has a lot of issues I don't suggest the

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.020 
has a lot of issues I don't suggest the
style<00:04:06.439> but<00:04:07.540> my<00:04:08.540> hair<00:04:08.750> usually<00:04:09.139> does<00:04:09.290> okay<00:04:09.590> so

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
style but my hair usually does okay so

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.129 
style but my hair usually does okay so
yeah<00:04:11.030> most<00:04:11.389> of<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.599> things<00:04:11.719> I<00:04:11.840> do<00:04:11.959> with<00:04:12.049> my

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
yeah most of the things I do with my

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.479 
yeah most of the things I do with my
hair<00:04:12.290> are<00:04:12.439> pretty<00:04:12.590> damaging<00:04:13.040> anyway<00:04:13.430> so

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
hair are pretty damaging anyway so

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:29.960 
hair are pretty damaging anyway so
obviously<00:04:14.799> it's<00:04:15.799> alright

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.540 

okay<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.620> as<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.860> can<00:04:32.100> see<00:04:32.280> they're<00:04:32.430> not

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
okay so as you can see they're not

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.400 
okay so as you can see they're not
perfect<00:04:32.940> on<00:04:33.060> both<00:04:33.090> sides<00:04:33.480> one<00:04:33.840> that's<00:04:34.230> kind<00:04:34.380> of

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
perfect on both sides one that's kind of

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.530 
perfect on both sides one that's kind of
here<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.800> one's<00:04:34.980> kind<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.250> there<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.820> it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
here and one's kind of there it it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.820 
here and one's kind of there it it
doesn't<00:04:36.990> matter<00:04:37.170> just<00:04:37.560> put<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.670> messy<00:04:39.090> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
doesn't matter just put it on messy and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.070 
doesn't matter just put it on messy and
tomorrow<00:04:40.830> see<00:04:41.490> how<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.850> goes<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.810> tightness

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
tomorrow see how it goes the tightness

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.820

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.800 
this yesterday and he came out cute and
so<00:04:53.010> I'm<00:04:53.130> experimenting<00:04:53.700> with<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.240> because

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
so I'm experimenting with it because

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.150 
so I'm experimenting with it because
yesterday<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.320> was<00:04:55.410> dry<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.860> just<00:04:56.040> put

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
