 the game is with 26 megabyte guys 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.990
 It's really cool, because the name 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.610
 that we have here one of the main 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.450
 mix of games I've seen in my 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.940
 life 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.100
 in case the chicken is obviously 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.500
 a mixture of game pec even with 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 flash road he knows how I talked about 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.790
 company is not a major company 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.130
 the company that created it, let's say the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.230
 even though it was also released 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.880
 in partnership with Ipsos mistake to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.440
 who does not remember is the company that did the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.050
 Croatian road then we will find 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.550
 here an infinite game where you will have 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.280
 there the bottom of the opening of the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.870
 document being highly destroyed. 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.090
 The goal is to collect the maximum 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.200
 possible to escape there from the little monsters 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.820
 of the technician 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.070
 you will find things that you already had 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.930
 in the first pr are for example that 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.730
 part that will make the team stronger is 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.130
 even if he eats the ghosts 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.050
 You'll also find those coins 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.970
 that you had on crosse hood and india 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.740
 graphic is the same as the classic said 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.850
 then so more tour game 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.000
 I really recommend what you're talking about. 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.970
 a lot because he's super hero 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.250
 Do you like those games where you go? 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.020
 long time playing without being able to do 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.940
 a good score since they play more 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.280
 still because the game is beginner 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.980
 So this game here is perfect, you guys. 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.630
 People, I'm here with gogo and get up. 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.760
 a category that today by the company 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.310
 serve a study is a game in which the team 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.260
 has been shallow because it is 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
 here our goal is to use this 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.910
 roth ball at bottom of screen 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.979
 in the chic name on the right side to 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.269
 that you make circles and get 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.129
 move your scenery to your profile 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.900
 without hitting the shapes that appear in the 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.389
 right to left or left 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 to the right a very good thing of the game 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.960
 is that the yellow island population in the 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.180
 time, ie the longer you 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.460
 stay in the most difficult phase she will stay 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.259
 and more obstacles you will stay too 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.879
 It's very good because you lose a lot. 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.069
 easily along so you do not 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.090
