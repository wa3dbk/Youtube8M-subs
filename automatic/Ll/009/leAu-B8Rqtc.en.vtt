00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 good morning everyone today was to press and 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to a video more about the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.270
 pokemon world good guys yesterday went out 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.890
 information yesterday and the day before yesterday that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.480
 information or a couple of little things that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.660
 surely you end up looking for 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 enough information let's say real but 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
 that are rumors interviews that have 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.520
 made to important managers or fish 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 fat of game freak of o de de pokémon 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.970
 company and they have talked about 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.920
 some little things some tracks that give 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 for the next Pokémon games that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 surely you like it and I have to tell 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.810
 that is, it basically has to do it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.279
 you know that last week was the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.960
 pokemon world championship and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.550
 evidently evident there I repeat has 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 there were pokemon fat cats and they have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 interviewed these people of the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 pokémon company and have answered from 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 some good way let's say giving 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.760
 clues but also not counting anything 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.649
 spectacular 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 in order first reports first first 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 big news that I had to tell you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.070
 is that because a mysterious world comes out 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.239
 on November 20 for america that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.350
 that also say Latin America in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.760
 theory so Latinos are 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 Pretty much congratulations on day 20 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 of November in theory to deny me what 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 that the comments go down because I think 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.079
 yes yes imply that it comes out on the 20 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.890
 November the america also give to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 understand that it also comes out in 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 Latin America so in relation to this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 enough of the bulava this in the game 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.900
 until before months before the Europeans 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.490
 still 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 even no date which is I 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.970
 shit in the whole area but good in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 theory goes out also for spring in 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 europe the mysterious mega little world to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 same as it also comes in spring 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 pokemon poc intones well little in fighters 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 which 2 Pokémon game in 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 practically in three months that hits me 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 quite but it is what there is and also 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.350
 talking about spring he did repeat 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 an interview with a certain smith who is one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.270
 of the directors I repeat of the pokémon 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 company and gave a pretty clue 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.440
 quite weird said he had something that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 see the flowers with the next games 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.840
 from pokémon the flowers watch be because 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 the flowers that have to see the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.110
 flowers with all this I have no idea to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.640
 the best thing wants to imply something of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.010
 afe is 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.870
 accept you know how it affected the 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 pokemon ACETA say the little one 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.620
 ACETA favorite is a dark one flow 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 freight saint and no no is not shiny if it 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.530
 that is dark you do not really know but 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.690
 well you all know the pokémon of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.850
 accept that it is the flower that is best 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.280
 something has to do with that at best 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.200
 confirm this zeta pokemon I do not know very 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 well but of course important is the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.039
 theme of flowers and remember without 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.350
 carlos just before entering which 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.660
 of catches to youtube is like a 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.190
 small park full of flowers to the best 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.319
 that's important in the face of the next 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.700
 pokémon game I have no idea but 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.209
 I have a lot of desire you know that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.640
 also on February 27, 2016 pokemon 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.170
 as such turns 20 years old that is 20 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.610
 anniversary next year so what 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.810
 better to keep something in fact saved 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.550
 they have it saved it has many things 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.680
 they still do not want to tell 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.570
 about also being asked in 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.580
 plan on February 20 is the second 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.920
 such and such an anniversary and the king says yes 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.090
 we have things saved but I can not 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.650
 tell it because if they do not kill me 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.360
 basically says something like that she says no 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.160
 I can tell you I still do not have or is not 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.760
 pokémon to understand that in spring they go 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.260
 to spend a lot of things other than going to 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.850

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.930

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.230
 is now so that it leaves in spring not 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.880
 I have no idea but of course in the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.010
 next corocoro will be important 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 apart from why they are going to talk about poker 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.160
