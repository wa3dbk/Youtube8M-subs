by the way the only reason for no

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
by the way the only reason for no
current<00:00:32.550> plans<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.290> we

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
current plans is if we is because we

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.130
