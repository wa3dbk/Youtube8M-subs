00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.630
 but 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.410
 Annenkov 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.410
 she is 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.800
 you only 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.539
 a son 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.160
 girls all huge hello i am very 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.859
 glad to see you on my channel today 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.170
 I am in such an absolutely wonderful way 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.840
 Summer Cup I want to discuss with you topic 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.110
 peculiarities of summer hair care 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.640
 first let's try to figure it out 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.579
 what is hair care in summer 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.519
 different from winter hair care 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.600
 I came to a very simple conclusion if 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.790
 in winter we pay more nutrition 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.699
 hair in the summer we need more 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.940
 give importance to moisturizing why 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.210
 because in the summer our hair is very very 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.769
 dry under the influence of the sun wind 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.410
 sea ​​of ​​salt 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.869
 precipitation is all very 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.300
 dry the hair cuticle from here 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.880
 natural question is what to moisten 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.520
 hair you will not believe now tell you 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
 absolutely banal thing that many 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.830
 already cracked the teeth and some callus 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.409
 in summer you need to drink plenty of water 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.600
 in winter you can also drink plenty of water 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.599
 in the summer you can do more 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.729
 apply to the skin of the body on some hair 

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:34.429
 moisturizer but if you drink 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.739
 just one glass of water ideas nothing 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.530
 it will not help you unfortunately so 

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:42.619
 rule number one drink water like 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.840
 moisten the hair outside definitely 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.970
 there are a huge number of masks 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 mass production of industrial 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.520
 funds that are aimed at moisturizing 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.140
 hair 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.929
 but industrial means for humidification 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.899
 hair if we want we can talk 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.700

 moisturizes they hung very cool in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160

 absolutely definitely have you in 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.350
 the fridge on what let's start for 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.660
 order to make this mask for us 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.890
 need some sour milk 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.150
 the fridge it can be kefir it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.330
 maybe sour it can be 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.240
 varenets as in my case also you 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.490
 Feel free to mix these products if 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.740
 you have such a desire and second 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.840
 ingredient of the obligatory which us 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.360
 will need this oil which is also 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.070
 suitable for your hair type will change 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.280
 unrefined olive 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.500
 but sometimes I make a mixture of olive and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.660
 coconut can add flaxseed 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.730
 also you can absolutely safely 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.250
 add for liquid vitamins sometimes i 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.910
 add tocopherol acetate this if 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.280
 easier to say vitamin e in liquid form 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.680
 absolutely safe to add essential 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.540
 oils that suit you for your 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.570
 dry hair i use oil often

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.560
 tips add egg but I unfortunately 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.660
 can't give you the same good ones 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.850
 recommendations for this ingredient because 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.340
 that unfortunately the egg is my hair terrible 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.200
 drying in principle the amount 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.510
 ingredients depends on the length of your 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.600
 hair I 'll be home you approximate proportion 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.430
 this is what good homemade masks are the same 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.640
 proportions you may not 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.060
 depending on your hair and whether 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.090
 what they need average I use somewhere 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.470
 three to one that is three parts of kefir 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.080
 sour cream or mixture to one part in butter 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.419
