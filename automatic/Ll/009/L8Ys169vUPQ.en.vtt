00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
really unique for me and I really like

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.849 
really unique for me and I really like
this<00:03:32.699> one<00:03:33.569> thing<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.199> kind<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.739> like

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
floors these are really slippery so I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.830 
floors these are really slippery so I
might<00:03:40.139> need<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:41.069> some<00:03:41.790> sort<00:03:41.909> of<00:03:42.000> rubber<00:03:42.269> I

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
though but the rubber things that you

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.030 
though but the rubber things that you
can<00:03:48.690> put<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> bottom<00:03:49.349> of<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> shoe<00:03:49.739> to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
can put on the bottom of the shoe to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.309 
can put on the bottom of the shoe to
provide<00:03:50.579> more<00:03:50.760> traction<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.419> don't<00:03:51.750> know<00:03:51.810> but

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
provide more traction I don't know but

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.740 
provide more traction I don't know but
these<00:03:52.530> were<00:03:52.680> about<00:03:52.859> $95<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.419> really<00:03:54.629> like

strings are on the on the shoulder area

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.710 
strings are on the on the shoulder area
probably<00:04:09.720> for<00:04:10.019> hanging<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:10.979> they<00:04:11.609> have<00:04:11.819> kind

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
probably for hanging but they have kind

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.610 
probably for hanging but they have kind
of<00:04:12.810> these<00:04:12.959> tan<00:04:13.379> brown<00:04:15.019> buttons<00:04:16.019> on<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.409> side

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
wear a lot of 10 things so this was

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.600 
wear a lot of 10 things so this was
perfect<00:04:41.840> for<00:04:42.380> me<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.860> fit<00:04:43.340> really<00:04:43.520> well

perfect for me and it fit really well
the<00:04:44.450> buttons<00:04:44.780> run<00:04:45.050> down<00:04:45.350> all<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.370> way<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
the buttons run down all the way to the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.140 
the buttons run down all the way to the
chest<00:04:47.690> area<00:04:47.930> not<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.550> know<00:04:49.640> all<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.910> way<00:04:49.970> down

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
chest area not you know all the way down

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.320 
chest area not you know all the way down
and<00:04:50.450> its<00:04:50.960> really<00:04:51.140> light<00:04:51.410> it's<00:04:51.680> cotton<00:04:52.330> yeah

this<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.660> about<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:54.260> think<00:04:54.470> ten<00:04:54.800> dollars

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
this is about I think ten dollars

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.250 
this is about I think ten dollars
because<00:04:55.310> when<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.580> went<00:04:55.820> during<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.870> think

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
because when I went during I think

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.220 
because when I went during I think
either<00:04:57.950> after<00:04:58.580> Christmas<00:04:59.120> they<00:04:59.870> had<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.020> big

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.260 
either after Christmas they had a big
big<00:05:00.500> sale<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.460> was<00:05:01.610> ten<00:05:01.880> or<00:05:01.910> fifteen

ninety-six percent polyester so this

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.570
