00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to my vilsack just 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.980
 ended the presentation of the apple on which 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.379
 showed a huge amount of new 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.570
 products but more on that in other videos 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.550
 while we are interested in the fact that as 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.820
 only tim cook left the stage 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.900
 update available to ios 7 03 by many 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.789
 long awaited 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.800
 correcting a large number of bugs 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.380
 but as it turned out bringing 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 new features let's see what 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.920
 there appeared go 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 Apple discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 partner and store apple just.ru 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 despite a slight ordinal 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.920
 number avia 703 it is really very 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 an important update that eliminates a number 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.219
 critical bugs start at least with 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.489
 animation as if it did not sound funny 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 but many who have upgraded from version 6 to version 7 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.690
 first noticed 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.079
 not fast and not smooth animation that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 shocked people many complained about 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.590
 what was their very cradles 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.320
 quite a lot more in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.940
 Internet as you can see in 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 703 everybody won this problem 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 really smooth and very fast so 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 what I think is a question closed but I tell you 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.180
 show absolute killer feature which 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 plunged me into absolute shock in 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 good sense of the word if we go to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 basic universal access reduction 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.299
 movements earlier this function disabled 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 parallax effect and on this in principle its 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.770
 functions ended now if we had it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.990
 activate see what happens i 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 I want to minimize the settings and they just 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.490
 disappear i want to open safari and they 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.590
 just appear and now work with 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.590
 my smartphone has become just mega 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.420
 cool you really apple magic you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 just switch between programs 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.229
 while when you click on the icon you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.390
 almost instantly gain access to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.060
 see how this works 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 happens clicked and she is already active you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 you can use it very cool 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 now spotlight has returned the opportunity 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.520
 wikipedia internet search 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 there wasnâ€™t enough I swore because 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.560
 team actively used not to function 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.299
 liked it now there is again and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 corrected such a bug which was observed in 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.990
 compass when was wrong 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.329
 Calibrated gyroscope was impossible 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 get 0 on your device if you 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.569
 he was laid on some level 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.879
 surface and equals you 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.030
 value 0 was most likely unavailable 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.400
 Now 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.860
 this is also good and it is very cool 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.120
 that apple corrected such things quickly 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.610
 without any particular problems added function 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.420
 keychain aiklaud she was claimed 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.069
 with the announcement of aver 7 then we removed it though 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 in the mavericks she is who became 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.360
 available today simultaneously 703 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.209
 a bunch of keys please 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.920
 where your passwords are stored and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.620
 so further more if you look 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.989
 in the safari settings you will see that here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.470
 you can monitor that 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.000
 what are called passwords and autofill 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.980
 here is your saved credit 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.739
 cards and so on and so forth that is 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.709
 these are all minor improvements they are very 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.780
 seriously went to the benefit of ios 7 but also mine 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.850
 personal joy about iphone 5s 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.980
 look how fast tachadi 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.140
 station works with reduced traffic 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.090
 literally bm 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.819
 and we immediately loaded the desktop 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
 that's very cool i definitely like 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.620
 ease which came in with 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.900
 the appearance of 703 is of course basic 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.209
 number of bugs was cured i'm talking 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.360
 about the impossibility of sending a and place that 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.000
 chatting or circumventing passwords on lock 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.890
 or especially fatal glitch when working 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.630
 sayborg which resulted in rare 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.420
 device reboot cases 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.329
 but not everything was caught and cured 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.070
 For example, it is not clear where to go 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.959
 statusbar when working with not adapted 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.940
 submit under the application but besides 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.489
 All other things, our favorite bug with you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.530
 closing 3 simultaneous applications 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.630
 multitasking leading to appearance 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.120
 phantom icons i hope that in the future 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.209
 all this of course will fix but for now 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.750
