 have got the military got them 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.910
 using satellites and radar there is very 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.529
 many interesting things prove 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.689
 liner wreck was thorough 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.329
 planned in it of course you can not 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.159
 believe but too many coincidences 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:28.419
 all systematized Alexei head 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.339
 Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.710
 the place where the whole operative 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.329
 information is available to the Russian General Staff 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.760
 it is here today for journalists

 military monitor satellites

 territory around Donetsk and Lugansk 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.890
 first conclusion malaysian boeing 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.559
 really seen on a given 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.039
 the maximum air corridor 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.429
 away from the left of the corridor 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 made 14 kilometers what served 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.429
 cause exits abroad trails 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.489
 crew navigation error or 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.299
 execution of commands of the Ukrainian dispatcher 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.009
 air traffic control 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.290
 Dnipropetrovsk will definitely be 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.790
 answer only from and decrypt 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.280
 flight recorders 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.350
 in military language this is called data 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.479
 objective control with snapshots from 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.520
 space you can not argue they clearly 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.320
 show in the Donbas on the eve of the tragedy 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.110
 in unfolded bat ready state 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.979
 there were four battalions of anti-aircraft 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 beech complexes 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.869
 Ukrainian army and this despite the fact that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.180
 aviation rebel no further interesting 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.909
 the picture of July 14, beeches are under 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.500
 Lugansk on July 17 on the day of the fall of Boeing 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.130
 already near the territory controlled 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.409
 militias and the next day July 18 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.750
 they just disappeared disappeared into 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.180
 unknown direction the question arises 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.250
 why 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.920
 the battery is near in this area 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.369
 territory controlled by the militias 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.170
 and immediately before the tragedy yet 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 one oddity the sky over Donetsk in that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.829
 the day was not empty at all besides 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.570
 Malaysian Boeing flew there aircraft 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.329
 from copenhagen and from paris 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.640
 but at 17:21 that minute when the liner 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.319
 began to collapse on radar appeared 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.840
 one more dispatcher mark 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.159
 requesting specifications again 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.859
 appeared object 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:22.760
 data on its parameters get not 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:26.239
 maybe because most likely air 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.359
 the vessel is not recognized by the secondary identification system 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.280
 equipped which is typical for military 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.959
 Aircraft experts have determined so 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 suddenly and abruptly gained altitude 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.670
 Ukrainian su-25 he has missiles 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.639
 air-to-air and it can hit targets 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.650
 at a height of 10 kilometers after the fall 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.999
 Boeing attack aircraft for a long time to patrol 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.669
 over the crash site 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:49.010
 as if controlling the situation earlier 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.409
 Ukrainian officials reported that 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.090
 on this day 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.060
 Ukrainian military aircraft in the area 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.730
 the accident was not like 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.590
 see it is not so Ukrainian media 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.959
 tried to divert attention from the plane 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.120
 ghost videos of how supposedly 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.669
 rebels take out disguised beeches 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.099
 but analysis records show done in 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.139
 the city of Krasnoarmeysk which is already 12 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.480
 May controls the Ukrainian security forces 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.799
 city ​​name can be seen on the ad 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.449
 car dealership banner 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.699
 so now fair questions 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:23.049
 arises already in the Russian defense 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:27.349
 departments what is this launcher 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.509
 vodka of matching system is it where its 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.569
 transported 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:38.870
 visit chance spoil where she is 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:42.799
 now mountains why is she charged not 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.939
 full ammunition for missiles y and z laurid 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.639
 about misom mishin and when the last 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.500
 since its launch data was carried out 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.389
 ministries of defense are ready to provide 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.609
 All experts, in turn, calls 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.009
 do the same thing american colleagues 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.060
 it is known that at the time of the tragedy too 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.189
 strange coincidence 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.169
 in Donetsk flew American 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.479
 experimental satellite specifically 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:09.729
 created to track launches 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.729
