00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
said well I'll give you a test so our

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.120 
said well I'll give you a test so our
test<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.350> arranged<00:01:30.530> aren't<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> your

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
test was arranged aren't you your

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010

interpretation<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> part<00:01:33.240> caused<00:01:33.840> little

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
interpretation of the part caused little

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.230 
interpretation of the part caused little
trouble<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:35.189> America<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:36.180> were

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
trouble I think in America they were

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.170 
trouble I think in America they were
touchy<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:37.430> yes<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> Russians<00:01:38.820> were

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
touchy about yes the Russians were

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.980 
touchy about yes the Russians were
touchy<00:01:39.390> about<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.759> Central<00:01:41.759> Europe

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
touchy about it's in Central Europe

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
touchy about it's in Central Europe
because<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.110> were<00:01:43.310> determined<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
because they were determined that it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
because they were determined that it
should<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.030> called<00:01:45.240> anti-semitic<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> word

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
should be called anti-semitic the word

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.719 
should be called anti-semitic the word
Jew<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.530> never<00:01:46.740> mentioned<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
Jew was never mentioned in it because it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.130 
Jew was never mentioned in it because it
was<00:01:47.820> no<00:01:48.000> question<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> being<00:01:48.840> anti-semitic

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
was no question of it being anti-semitic

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
was no question of it being anti-semitic
as<00:01:50.130> indeed<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.090> Dickens<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.720> accused

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
of being anti-semitic which he hadn't

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.130 
of being anti-semitic which he hadn't
and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.579> he<00:01:53.670> went<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.909> wrote<00:01:54.750> another<00:01:54.990> novel

I would be pretty charity of doing and I
have<00:07:30.960> been<00:07:31.199> tempted<00:07:31.589> to<00:07:32.089> suggest<00:07:33.089> it<00:07:33.330> once<00:07:33.539> or

have been tempted to suggest it once or
twice<00:07:33.750> but<00:07:34.229> then<00:07:34.500> I<00:07:34.770> feel<00:07:35.430> I<00:07:35.490> could<00:07:35.610> only

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
twice but then I feel I could only

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:41.600 
twice but then I feel I could only
direct<00:07:36.270> something<00:07:39.589> about<00:07:40.589> which<00:07:40.830> I<00:07:40.979> felt<00:07:41.520> I

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
direct something about which I felt I

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.429 
direct something about which I felt I
