00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.140
 by silence we close the door of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.530
 security we started talking about 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.530
 Projects 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 and to the day 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 what please 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.760
 javier aguirre mister congratulations for the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.310
 habit victory mac de catalunya 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.680
 live radio 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.120
 I would ask you first if you do not 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.059
 can explain the change of sensations 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 after the rest and in second place 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.770
 if you can explain the change of sergio 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.420
 Garcia 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 Well the truth is that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 the sensations that we reach level 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.109
 very long in a game that matched 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.539
 He would decant forth by 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.210
 some detail and they were very 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.100
 alerts with brands with faults 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.769
 unnecessary with small details of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.289
 band seemed that the game in a 0-0 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.629
 nailed but some insist some 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.390
 detail could we put the balance to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.789
 favor and the change of sergio good 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.780
 I considered it prudent because I had already 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.420
 more spaces during the match 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.060
 good consider that in that long space 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.120
 the fastest man on the team is this 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.700
 I saw and that's it 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.170
 the fatigue also do not say that it is the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.110
 case of sergio much less but the sun 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.560
 it was brutal there I want to congratulate the 25 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.540
 28 players to the referees and the public 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.540
 because it enters we make sun that gave pleasure 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 it's a wild wild time the truth 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.510
 if you saw if you can not comment on the play 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.159
 that controversy that has had to the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.540
 original goal of the grenade the protest not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.510
 I know how he has seen her from his position 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 very difficult I do not see anything from my optics 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.070
 I do not see anything I see legs and repeat the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.140
 victory from my perspective no nothing nothing nothing 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.680
 I would have to watch it on television again 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.320
 to see but from my perspective I did not see 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.810
 nothing as I tell you so it went well 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.070
 much traffic many legs if of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.940
 suddenly the goalkeeper has the courage to 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.640
 referee whistled is already 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.990
 mister the problem has come out here 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.540
 the perfect plan has come to espanyol 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.580
 an hour waiting and in the last half 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.010
 hour with players 'refreshment' now 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.320
 downloading were not 90 - waiting 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.970
 we wait 90 minutes more than an hour 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.770
 this team waits well and strikes back 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.840
 very well it came out perfect we are a 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.480
 waiting team we carry four 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.070
 waiting for the rival parties and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.130
 cons attack if it worked out the plan 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.030
 perfect we were 60 it was an hour 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.120
 waiting 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.790
 good afternoon in the duster my friend 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 I wanted to ask him why they told him 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 here that almost in the locker room if that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.099
 It has been necessary because there has been a threat 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.569
 of being the play of day 6 and good 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.250
 the 5 had 15 terrible days with pain in 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.290
 the shoulder trying to get it back 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.860
 trying to come together paradoxically 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.860
 the league break 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.230
 and well, he 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.120
 at half time we do not talk just looking 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.990
 we knew did not know he had shat 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 but then recovered well and nothing at the end 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.700
 He told me that he wanted to play without 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.950
 having a ball was already thinking about 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 assault first and then the time and 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.849
 then a boy is a boy who 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.819
 is very self-critical there is no need to 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.430
 tell him many things 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.719
 I continue to say friendship was going to be a 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.359
 party other than last year 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.060
 either to be a great match and it has been 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.740
 different in the game scheme 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.700
 more than served 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.230
 but we had strength in the midfield 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.180
 we try to play football from behind 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.730
 We tried the rival pressured them and not 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.700
 allowed us but we strengthened the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.070
 midfield and from there we went 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.780
 maturing the party so that they 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.480
 They came up with local status 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.510
 they had to attack and we take advantage 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.690
 its spaces at the end good then a 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.130
 match a detail and 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.440
 and we leave satisfied mister began his 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.870
 cycle here in the espanyol here in 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.790
 Granada with a draw now a victory 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 this year things can not go better 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.790
 good for now we are a team what 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.850
 we go Sunday to Sunday match to 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.560
 party week after week no we are not 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.870
 we are players and coaches that 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.870
 We have experience and we know that this 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.080
 It is very long that euphoria or 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.110
 discouragement can not do our half 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.060
 emotional balance not for carrying 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.190
 good points or not take them we can neither 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.530
 discourage us or come upstairs because 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.240
 then the blow is strong then this 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.610
 it's sorrow starts let's get settled 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.860
 all teams it is clear that those of 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.870
 up they come out as shots because they are 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.900
 those who are going to be there all year 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.110
 surely and us with us 14 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.020
 15 teams in the league and go looking for a 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.570
 Long-term long-term career to see 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.740
 who comes first to the goal that they are 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.740
 forty-something points 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.330
 I wanted to ask him also about the goal 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.530
 de lance is a game of has been a 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.180
 party a lot of work but that has been 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.129
 decided with a touch of genius to 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.690
 ball stop that they said they had 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.400
 people able to flip the game 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.530
 any time a stopped ball of 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.180
 benÃ­tez the same good I scored a shot of 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.550
 there from ricky who took a gallop 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.009
 pull one to the stick there is a gen to great already 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.960
 derrick that match very matched very 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.780
 equaled and was going to decant on one side 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.699
 for the other with a genius is released 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.580
 he hits the ball in a great way 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.220
 unstoppable impossible makes a parable and 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.900
 magnificent and that this is the talent of 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.659
 the players not us the entrance we 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:54.150
 we limited to giving it that certain orientation 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.150
 and then it's on the field of play they decide 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.620
 thank you very much
