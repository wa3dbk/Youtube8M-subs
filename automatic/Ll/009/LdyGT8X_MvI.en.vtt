00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
location and I was just practice going

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
location and I was just practice going
down<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.610> scope<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.090> popping<00:00:39.480> off<00:00:39.600> enemies

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
down to scope and popping off enemies

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.240 
down to scope and popping off enemies
from<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> distance<00:00:40.649> measurement<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
from a distance measurement of this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.479 
from a distance measurement of this
between<00:00:41.730> down<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:43.050> actual<00:00:43.559> scope<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.129> when

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
between down and my actual scope to when

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
between down and my actual scope to when
I<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.760> go<00:00:45.120> down<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.870> sights<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> lot

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I actually go down the sights now a lot

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.380 
I actually go down the sights now a lot
of<00:00:47.070> people<00:00:47.160> actually<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> misconception

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of people actually have a misconception

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
of people actually have a misconception
about<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.559> you're<00:00:49.680> aiming<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
about this when you're aiming down the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.119 
about this when you're aiming down the
scope<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:52.020> somebody<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
scope and you see somebody in your

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
scope and you see somebody in your
sights<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.329> zoom<00:00:54.750> back<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
sights and then you zoom back to how I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
sights and then you zoom back to how I
am<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> try<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> pop<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:57.899> off

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
am right now and you try to pop them off

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
am right now and you try to pop them off
the<00:00:58.199> reason<00:00:58.440> why<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.070> doesn't<00:00:59.250> work<00:00:59.699> about

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the reason why that doesn't work about

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.039 
the reason why that doesn't work about
99%<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.100> bloody<00:01:02.370> time<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.690> once

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
99% of the bloody time it's because once

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.630 
99% of the bloody time it's because once
you<00:01:04.229> zoom<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> scope<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> weapon

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you zoom out of the scope the weapon

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
you zoom out of the scope the weapon
actually<00:01:05.970> moves<00:01:06.240> left<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:06.960> depending

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
actually moves left or right depending

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
actually moves left or right depending
on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> weapon<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.030> lever<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
on the weapon now this lever right here

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
on the weapon now this lever right here
actually<00:01:09.930> moves<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.890> i<00:01:10.979> zoom<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
actually moves right when i zoom out of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
actually moves right when i zoom out of
scope<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.479> got<00:01:12.750> used<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> enough

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
scope like the Icebreaker iceberg it has

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
scope like the Icebreaker iceberg it has
a<00:01:46.049> more<00:01:46.439> smooth<00:01:47.070> feel<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.880> with

a more smooth feel to it with
quickscoping<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.310> sometimes<00:01:50.310> quick<00:01:50.970> scope

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
quickscoping now I sometimes quick scope

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
quickscoping now I sometimes quick scope
with<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> patient<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> time<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.439> well<00:01:52.680> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
with the patient the time as well but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.249 
with the patient the time as well but
remember<00:01:53.640> each<00:01:53.850> sniper<00:01:54.090> rifle<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.689> different

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
remember each sniper rifle is different

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
remember each sniper rifle is different
and<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> angle<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> gun<00:01:56.549> comes<00:01:56.880> back<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and the angle that the gun comes back on

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.440 
and the angle that the gun comes back on
when<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.380> zooms<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.070> scope<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.579> different

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
when it zooms out of scope is different

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
when it zooms out of scope is different
for<00:02:00.509> each<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.560> Icebreaker<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> am

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
for each one and the Icebreaker I am

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.390 
for each one and the Icebreaker I am
used<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.909> write<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> patient<00:02:03.869> I'm
