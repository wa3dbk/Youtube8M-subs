hey steve here from post-processing
mastery<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.849> photoshop<00:00:15.330> tutorial

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
mastery and in this photoshop tutorial

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.300 
mastery and in this photoshop tutorial
i'm<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> show<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.619> couple<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.130> quick

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
i'm going to show you a couple of quick

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
i'm going to show you a couple of quick
and<00:00:17.520> easy<00:00:17.609> ways<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> boost<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> color<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> your

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and easy ways to boost the color in your

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.679 
and easy ways to boost the color in your
images<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.699> we're<00:00:20.939> working<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> same

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
images so we're working on the same

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330 
images so we're working on the same
images<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.500> left<00:00:22.650> off<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> last

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
images what we left off with in the last

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.210 
images what we left off with in the last
video<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> at<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> moment<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.010> quite<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
video and so at the moment it's quite a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
video and so at the moment it's quite a
low<00:00:26.430> contrast<00:00:26.910> we've<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.599> taken<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> raw

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
low contrast we've just taken the raw

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
low contrast we've just taken the raw
file<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> increased<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.699> shadow<00:00:30.210> brightness

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
file and increased the shadow brightness

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
file and increased the shadow brightness
to<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> where<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.590> now<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to get to where we are now and so the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630 
to get to where we are now and so the
first<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.140> boost<00:00:34.860> colors<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
first way that I would boost colors in

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
first way that I would boost colors in
an<00:00:35.730> image<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.270> simply<00:00:36.719> by<00:00:36.840> adding<00:00:37.020> contrast

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
an image is simply by adding contrast

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.280 
an image is simply by adding contrast
using<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> levels<00:00:38.610> adjustment<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
using the levels adjustment and so the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
using the levels adjustment and so the
method<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.680> basically<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.489> add<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> levels

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
method is basically just to add a levels

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.959 
method is basically just to add a levels
adjustment<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:43.340> see<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.670> three

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
adjustment and see we have these three

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.340 
adjustment and see we have these three
control<00:00:45.329> points<00:00:45.360> along<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> bottom<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
control points along the bottom of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
control points along the bottom of the
of<00:00:46.980> their<00:00:47.190> histogram<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> panel<00:00:48.300> here

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
of their histogram in this panel here

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
of their histogram in this panel here
I'm<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> move<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.770> middle<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I'm going to move this middle one up

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.250 
I'm going to move this middle one up
towards<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> do

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
towards the right and as you see I do

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.010 
towards the right and as you see I do
that<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.860> darkens<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> image<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.730> bit

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that and that darkens the image a bit

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
that and that darkens the image a bit
and<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.399> on

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and I'm going to take this this one on

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
and I'm going to take this this one on
the<00:00:56.610> left<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.239> hand<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.989> move

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the left on the right hand side and move

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
the left on the right hand side and move
it<00:00:58.289> towards<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> left<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.930> just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it towards the left and just

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.840 
it towards the left and just
concentrating<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> foreground

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
concentrating on the on the foreground

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.280 
concentrating on the on the foreground
especially<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> moment<00:01:03.870> because

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
especially at the moment because

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
especially at the moment because
obviously<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> sky<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.339> blowing<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> out

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
obviously the sky we're blowing that out

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.740 
obviously the sky we're blowing that out
sagging<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.140> contrasty<00:01:07.619> there

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
sagging too contrasty there

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
sagging too contrasty there
and<00:01:10.190> just<00:01:11.190> talking<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.030> again

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and just talking this off and on again

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.200 
and just talking this off and on again
you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.370> boost<00:01:14.370> in<00:01:14.550> contrast<00:01:15.060> has

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you can see the boost in contrast has

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.490 
you can see the boost in contrast has
actually<00:01:15.480> brought<00:01:15.690> these<00:01:15.840> colors<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
actually brought these colors out and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.270 
actually brought these colors out and
made<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.820> quite<00:01:18.000> pleasing<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:19.410> if<00:01:20.160> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
made them really quite pleasing so if I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.220 
made them really quite pleasing so if I
was<00:01:20.400> doing<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.870> know<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.110> real

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
was doing this for you know for real

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.150 
was doing this for you know for real
editing<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:22.980> image<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.550> would<00:01:23.820> basically

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
editing this image I would basically

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.890 
editing this image I would basically
make<00:01:26.160> an<00:01:26.250> adjustment<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.760> this<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.180> increase

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
make an adjustment like this to increase

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
make an adjustment like this to increase
the<00:01:28.020> contrast<00:01:28.380> around<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.920> foreground<00:01:29.610> here

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the contrast around the foreground here

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.660 
the contrast around the foreground here
and<00:01:30.120> then<00:01:30.660> using<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.230> gradient<00:01:31.830> into<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.400> layer

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and then using a gradient into a layer

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270 
and then using a gradient into a layer
mask<00:01:32.730> for<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.270> adjustment<00:01:33.810> layer<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.250> would

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
mask for this adjustment layer I would

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.860 
mask for this adjustment layer I would
I've<00:01:35.910> already<00:01:36.120> got<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.330> selected<00:01:36.480> so<00:01:36.810> I've

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
I've already got that selected so I've

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.420 
I've already got that selected so I've
got<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> gradient<00:01:37.320> I've<00:01:37.650> got<00:01:37.800> black<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> white

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
got a gradient I've got black and white

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
got a gradient I've got black and white
or<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.390> white<00:01:39.720> foreground<00:01:40.020> black<00:01:40.470> background

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
or a white foreground black background

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.030 
or a white foreground black background
and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> would<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.420> draw<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.350> quick<00:01:43.590> gradient

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and I would just draw a quick gradient

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.030 
and I would just draw a quick gradient
up<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:45.200> recover<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
up there just to recover and just to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
up there just to recover and just to
mask<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.820> effect<00:01:48.150> from<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.960> top

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
mask out this effect from that top

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
mask out this effect from that top
corner<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> sky<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
corner of the sky there you could use a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
corner of the sky there you could use a
brush<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> probably<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.740> more

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
brush and probably be a little bit more

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.650 
brush and probably be a little bit more
accurate<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.760> well<00:01:53.940> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.150> wanted<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.600> if

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
accurate as well if you wanted to or if

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.790 
accurate as well if you wanted to or if
you<00:01:54.720> wanted<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.259> accurate<00:01:55.470> you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
you wanted to be really accurate you

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040 
you wanted to be really accurate you
could<00:01:55.950> use<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> luminosity<00:01:56.460> mask<00:01:56.850> yeah<00:01:57.810> that's

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
could use a luminosity mask yeah that's

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.770 
could use a luminosity mask yeah that's
that's<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.740> first<00:01:59.060> method<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.300> really

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that's the first method of really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.930 
that's the first method of really
boosting<00:02:01.170> colors<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.130> by<00:02:02.310> doing<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
boosting colors and it's by doing it in

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.020 
boosting colors and it's by doing it in
a<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.800> receiving<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.700> colors

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
a way that you know receiving the colors

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.770 
a way that you know receiving the colors
as<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.180> side<00:02:06.420> effect<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.990> increasing<00:02:07.619> contrast

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
as a side effect of increasing contrast

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.140 
as a side effect of increasing contrast
the<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.920> next<00:02:11.130> way<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> we'll<00:02:11.520> show<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the the next way that we'll show you is

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
the the next way that we'll show you is
going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.570> be<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> way<00:02:12.870> where<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.290> pick<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to be a way where you can pick a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
going to be a way where you can pick a
certain<00:02:14.580> color<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.020> change<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
certain color and then just change the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.230 
certain color and then just change the
properties<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.010> color<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:18.000> we're<00:02:18.120> going

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
properties of that color and we're going

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.870 
properties of that color and we're going
to<00:02:18.270> do<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.600> by<00:02:18.990> adding<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.650> selective<00:02:20.610> color

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
to do that by adding a selective color

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.170 
to do that by adding a selective color
adjustment<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> I'll<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.060> then

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
adjustment so I'll do that now and then

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.640 
adjustment so I'll do that now and then
we<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.630> gives<00:02:24.810> us<00:02:24.990> we've<00:02:25.440> got<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we see what that gives us we've got this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
we see what that gives us we've got this
drop<00:02:25.920> down<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:26.370> where<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.730> pick<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
drop down here where we can pick a

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.510 
drop down here where we can pick a
particular<00:02:27.300> color<00:02:27.810> within<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> image<00:02:28.520> let's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
particular color within the image let's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.470 
particular color within the image let's
go<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.910> blues<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:32.250> can<00:02:32.490> affect<00:02:32.970> how

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
go with the blues and we can affect how

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.730 
go with the blues and we can affect how
much<00:02:33.680> cyan<00:02:34.680> magenta<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.460> yellow<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
much cyan magenta and yellow is in the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.060 
much cyan magenta and yellow is in the
blues<00:02:38.010> within<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> image<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:40.320> I'll<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.680> I'll

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
blues within the image so I'll just I'll

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.260 
blues within the image so I'll just I'll
just<00:02:41.220> play<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> couple<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.850> these<00:02:42.000> sliders

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
just play with a couple of these sliders

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.030 
just play with a couple of these sliders
and<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> effect<00:02:43.020> than<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> gives<00:02:43.470> us<00:02:43.650> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and see the effect than that gives us so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
and see the effect than that gives us so
let's<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.010> remove<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
let's see here as I as I remove the the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
let's see here as I as I remove the the
yellow<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.500> Blues<00:02:49.709> in<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:49.980> shot

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
yellow so that the Blues in the shot

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.770 
yellow so that the Blues in the shot
have<00:02:50.490> actually<00:02:50.760> got<00:02:50.910> some<00:02:51.120> yellow<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.570> there

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
have actually got some yellow in there

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.770 
have actually got some yellow in there
you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.740> just<00:02:52.770> see<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> subtle<00:02:53.780> brightening

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you can just see a subtle brightening

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.710 
you can just see a subtle brightening
and<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.020> subtle<00:02:55.200> blue<00:02:56.190> inning<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and a subtle blue inning of the the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
and a subtle blue inning of the the
water<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.100> also<00:02:59.580> let's<00:02:59.820> just<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.150> a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
water here and also let's just have a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.400 
water here and also let's just have a
look<00:03:00.330> at<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.480> magenta<00:03:00.870> let's<00:03:01.050> see<00:03:01.230> what

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
look at the magenta let's see what

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.680 
look at the magenta let's see what
happens<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.980> put<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.520> bit<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> magenta<00:03:03.150> into

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
happens if we put a bit of magenta into

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.180 
happens if we put a bit of magenta into
the<00:03:03.810> blues<00:03:04.050> there<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:06.090> em<00:03:06.690> yes<00:03:07.320> core<00:03:08.010> is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the blues there that's em yes core is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.280 
the blues there that's em yes core is
changing<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> color<00:03:09.240> quite<00:03:09.660> significantly

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
changing the color quite significantly

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.160 
changing the color quite significantly
but<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.640> depends<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.450> kind<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
but you know depends this is kind of a

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.550 
but you know depends this is kind of a
case<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.500> personal<00:03:13.830> taste<00:03:14.040> really<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:16.380> we

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
case of personal taste really and so we

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.740 
case of personal taste really and so we
can<00:03:16.680> remove<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.459> magenta<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.269> goes<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
can remove the magenta and it goes so a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.560 
can remove the magenta and it goes so a
lot<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.489> well<00:03:20.489> not<00:03:20.970> sure<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.330> that

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
lot so well not sure I like that

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.300 
lot so well not sure I like that
whatever<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.989> effect<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.709> think<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.160> like

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
whatever that effect is I think I like

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.800 
whatever that effect is I think I like
it<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.550> bit<00:03:23.730> more<00:03:23.760> magenta

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
it with a bit more magenta

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.900 
it with a bit more magenta
and<00:03:26.650> there<00:03:26.770> we<00:03:26.830> go<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.010> can<00:03:27.100> see<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:27.520> only

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
and there we go you can see that's only

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.250 
and there we go you can see that's only
affecting<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.420> Blues<00:03:28.660> within<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.080> image

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
affecting the Blues within the image

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.750 
affecting the Blues within the image
because<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:29.680> what<00:03:29.860> we've<00:03:29.980> got<00:03:30.160> selected

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
because that's what we've got selected

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.220 
because that's what we've got selected
in<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.240> drop-down<00:03:31.720> here

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
in the drop-down here

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
in the drop-down here
and<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.280> that's<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.580> two<00:03:33.730> techniques<00:03:34.060> I

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
and so that's the two techniques I

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.330 
and so that's the two techniques I
wanted<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.480> show<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:34.959> video<00:03:35.340> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
wanted to show you in this video you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.040 
wanted to show you in this video you
should<00:03:36.520> probably<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.569> know<00:03:37.660> take<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> bit<00:03:38.020> more
