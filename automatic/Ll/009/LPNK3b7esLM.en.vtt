00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.309
 2 with the title I bring you a part to 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.410
 in pain for teams and I'll be 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.320
 teaching how to kill more this one 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.570
 game that is 47 to 1 not my best 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.940
 idol match by teams of all 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.490
 double cases wisely but talking about 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.740
 whites 2 being better game in duel 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.390
 by teams is a game the burning of 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.850
 I think I can make it better 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.530
 only that I clicked on equipment this one was 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.510
 he learns something but not as stupid as 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.130
 pay to leave all those who are 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.260
 look at this he was the only bastard that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.829
 he killed me from there of the statue nothing 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 plus 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.520
 notice that all my equipment is fine 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.040
 is playing weiss everything is 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.079
 changing by those to that this game or 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.649
 be that to be able to be 5 in a 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.210
 minimum departure you need equipment or 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.200
 bad partners so if you have a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.059
 bad team 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.860
 obviously you are going to stay much more 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.079
 chingÃ³n but if you want to be this 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.000
 positive even if you have good equipment with 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.000
 The only thing I recommend is that 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.430
 know take something orbital as you can 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 you want to roam the morning people a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.939
 muffler 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.159
 says 4 with mylo more is the most photo but 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.439
 the easiest thing for everyone to do 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.030
 as I want I bring the hurdler this one 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.680
 I actually bring the primary bass player 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.539
 but not because I bring it, I will be 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 using all day sometimes of persimmons 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.840
 Marquez, as they have long seen 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.789
 was walking and on the b in red and from here 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 that web marketing but one thing that 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.299
 yes I tell them every time I shot him 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.490
 sunway if you let him stay distant 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 escapes remember that that guy did not know 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.720
 he died and he knows that there they go 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 as I am here because my team 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.220
 just look at the radar all my fucking 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.049
 team is there I'm here where 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 are these dudes remember what they 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.470
 I said that when they shoot them sandwich they 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.599
 they agree where you are there it went 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.819
 I fired and remembered that I was here 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.830
 notice my team only explodes when 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.599
 here they kill all the guys look 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.119
 that flight I left binder and then not 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.099
 recharge I was just going to recharge but it 's 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.709
 Anyway, it will reach you with more 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.590
 bullets notice that as I am killing already 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.780
 know that I'm here in one there was a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.549
 moment where they all came for me that is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.619
 that you are changing or if 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.480
 they are covering an area that is what 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.100
 I'm doing here, they may say 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.270
 what am I changing can they say what 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.130
 who wants but is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.260
 this is a very good way since as 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
 I have no teammates, I'm alone against 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.440
 all the bastards this day know that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.690
 I'm here 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.700
 this muffler is something very chunky in 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.380
 this case since you do not want to get 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.030
 discover that if a bastard comes 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.220
 notice that is where he failed with the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.350
 shotgun already when you bring the orbital 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.210
 just look at the radar and see that all 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.100
 they were coming here everyone was pointing 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.690
 so that this guy turned around 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.250
 because they wanted to get me back 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.320
 they thought he was just covering one 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 door but I was covering all look 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 there came two others then I took the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.230
 scorpion and they start to appear through 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 of my as they started to appear behind 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.730
 from me this good if it got stuck started to 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 change the class of the beast but this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.930
 the wey be there I killed him there was another 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.940
 look at another web came I did not want it 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.920
 risk I did not want to risk not what 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 marked that bring a bather because 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.480
 has a card means that they will have it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.160
 to use until they do as they like if 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.050
 they are a bit far and are changing 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.270
 the judges also who use the pinche 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.730
 frank you're worth nothing but what you bring 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 I would recommend to wish that they bring 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.020
 a class that makes them comfortable do not use 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.540
 a class that you see on YouTube or that you see 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.819
 in google or what do you see on facebook 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.099
 in a photo of a friend or whatever it is not 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.019
 or in a game until they use a 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.180
 class that you like me 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.849
 I love the weapons that come with the butt 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.099
 the flats not pinches submachine guns are only 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.079
 machin get that I do not recommend stock 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.720
 because those guys like they are ligerito 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.090
 already bring that integrated mother is one 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.359
 way as I tell them the easiest way 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.510
 to kill more in this game is taking out 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.370
 gusts taking them out site excursion 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.079
 unfortunately I did not have the swarm if 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.750
 was not killed to more our nails and 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.519
 to the squadron since it was like one 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.680
 to one of mine block in exchange for that 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.389
 I can take out the 4-1 because this one 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.849
 It also helps me where to go for 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.590
 Wherever I go, it serves me, but if 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.680
 there are comrades I say if there are enemies 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.079
 bad of the enemies this one not bad in 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.549
 the case that they are assholes I do not tell you 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.519
 bad so be my numbers that 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.560
 start attacking garbage garbage that 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.329
 start to take out all this you're going to 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.799
 get out that is also the helicopters 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.409
 they are a bit this one 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.270
 difficult because sometimes this is your turn 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.099
 enemies that do not destroy them there are oxen 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.500
 who spends all the points 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:31.379
 weak that take this unfortunately 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.030
 I not managed to get nuclear click to 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.039
 better if it was taken out but I decided 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.039
 get my streaks out I think so since the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.110
 dogs there that good I killed him 15 15 the 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.819
 I kill I think this snipe wey killed him 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.129
 I think it brings up the muffler in 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.440
 card were there are all those guys 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.569
 look at my speech in this maxim t 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.789
 so that if he has some challenge 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.800
 any suggestion asks the need 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.960
 tell me you are been uploading some 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.849
 records of exo zombies until yes 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.919
 they have some challenge for these zombies 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.870
 tell me there the comments any 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.460
 kind of challenge any chingadera but 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.050
 try to make it not so long 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.050
 because I do not want a zombie game 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.659
 of pinches two hours and how they see there 47 a 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.030
 1 part of andulo by teams I hope 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.030
 they liked it too and thank you 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.669
 ah
