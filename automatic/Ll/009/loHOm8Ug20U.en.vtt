00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
this is it gonna be like values a little

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.530 
this is it gonna be like values a little
bit<00:02:50.890> less<00:02:51.070> now<00:02:51.370> or<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
bit less now or do you think like it

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.240

think the shoes will have any value
decrease<00:02:57.310> because<00:02:58.300> obviously<00:02:58.690> there<00:02:59.680> are

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
decrease because obviously there are
