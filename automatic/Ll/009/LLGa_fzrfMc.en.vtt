00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.070
 and hello to all these will die there and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.130
 welcome to this explanatory video 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.470
 on how to unlock the venom ix on the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.469
 map an art is the remake of domme 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.870
 on the new dlc devastation then 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.120
 very very simple so you just have to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.180
 the map how do you see you have a street 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.700
 where there are three bridles on it 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.739
 maintains a gateway while you 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.969
 see I put them up the goal it's going to be 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.640
 destroy them then to destroy them 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.890
 with an explosive in this case semtex 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.620
 when you see it works very very 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.539
 well so the second one needs to be a 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.170
 more precise hair you can achieve 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.420
 as registered friends 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.559
 enormously and for the third I 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.699
 used a rocket launcher that what 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.649
 I was alone of course and here you are 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 drop the bridge while 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.270
 simply it must go there or do 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.680
 so be ready for the passade when 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.830

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.100
 and hop what are you in 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.620
 there and that's the venom pics you 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.540
