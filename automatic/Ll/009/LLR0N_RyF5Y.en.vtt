00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:23.870
 Okuma Sae and I say you k do our design on the basis of the various documents received from customers with a cloth 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:29.150
 It is sometimes construction management also allowed to go to also the site causing the drawings from 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:33.160
 The opportunity was originally at the design school 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.880
 Most friends are in the design company 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 Also I'd entered 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 I am that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.940
 I wanted to do that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.840
 I did a job on I'm a design office with it 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.610
 That gave me an opportunity to do architecture 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.810
 Something comes from where there is nothing 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.810
 Not great 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.410
 Interesting Toka that really 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.880
 I do think that it is set meal at your own 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.880
 I really like it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.760
 that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 First of all First of all in that family 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:23.690
 Towards the house to live in the whole family talking well is opinion unification 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.630
 That you mean you want to in any wind that as with all those who live in that there first thought well 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.600
 I say I want to and it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.820
 Ano de would like to convey again 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.380
 Hmm 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:41.930
 Which it how much here is what is also a problem of say this or scoop out Kedomo after all 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.120
 I think it's quite different depending on how well the communication works 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.770
 Ummm 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.440
 As high as possible 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 A lot of things 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:02:01.140
 I think that it is the imagination of the end when you get 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 I think it is an imagination until I can turn it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 If there were a lot of various conditions there are many 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.630
 To learn or have I'm a high school last this is you were not yourself if he designed in the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.460
 The 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.410
 But consider the fact that Do that those who were saying this is something we have said, be it 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.080
 In addition 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.470
 just like this 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.630
 Does anyone use it to make a suggestion first 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:39.200
 So if you want to say that the customers are good 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.200
 How can you hear from how you can properly capture that you have that of the customer 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.819
 This kind of expectations Toka after this kind of place if I were you 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.160
 More than 81,000 people would like this storage 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:59.590
 I wonder if it would be easier if I did something like this 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.480
 The door is absolutely inconvenient at the point where people are good or it is their own daily life 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.630
 That in the visible 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:12.460
 Where you think it's bothersome or something like that 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:18.740
 I'm going to suggest that it is better to use rice 3 as much as possible . 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.580
 Because I think what the cost of daily living is so important to me that what's going on and where it works 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.069
 If you can um 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.210
 Storage too 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.460
 There is such a place there 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.700
 Do you have to pay, or suggest storage that matches the place? 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.760
 I guess I'm anyway after 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.879
 If you walk along the road, it is the first 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.739
 How can I do something in the house and if I sit down I will calm down after all 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:52.060
 Including that kind of thing 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.690
 After all I thought that I was trying to suggest what I felt, so it was a woman 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.110
 Isn't it a matter of saying 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:04.690
 I do not know, but because I am an item myself , that kind of perspective is that man 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.690
 There is the fact that wonder if more is the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.199
 After all, I think it's really important is the I mean the appearance Kedomo I'm such a matter of course 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.940
 Live 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:27.030
 That feels good and I do is I wish it that nice nice I think or can be painted to everyone 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.380
 Even when the audience was Irashi and 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.529
 Parra from it I think that happy if Moraere to say Toka nice sister there is still 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.950
 It is essential 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:44.780
 Of course I also put emphasis on the appearance as I think so 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:50.300
 As there are buildings for the four seasons , how to arrange the buildings for writing 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.790
 After all how do you see from the most visible side 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.070
 Is it obsessive about the appearance? 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:02.260
 In the rear window position or even if it is possible to arrange evenly 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:08.200
 Of course I want to line up and that 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.830
 There is, but it will be messed up in the middle if absolutely arranged in this way 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.620
 The 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:17.890
 This as long as that the Tteyuu I can not use a manner that you can so that I'd say if 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.990
 Even though that kind of balance takes course 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.289
 So after all also only 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.210
 Usability 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:31.050
 Kind of pleasure on the thought that I mean whether use from that to what the wind 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.200
 Always think about how to balance 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.220
 After all the general cleaning is 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.350
 Is it easy? 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.920
 Or if there is a window in the place which is not aging but it is important I that I say to do together it 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.060
 that 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:50.810
 I'm there is aging not window in that house in the actual up their own experience would probably not even blow 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.449
 There is a window it 's such a 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.029
 4 The company is not even if 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:04.400
 So even if it's a nice house, I'll put it in a really outrageous place 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:08.910
 And I wonder how I 'm going to suffer if I'm not old enough 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:13.770
 Well brand in what to do to the one thread agar How talk me to the 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:19.180
 So it was also kind of surreal to so much is 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:22.160
 After all I think that it is better not to do 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.569
 If you have a difficult office 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.189
 Nde also the I mean is whether 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:31.060
 In the place which is not replaced standing But I is I'm not such a thing 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:35.660
 Or a down light 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:39.350
 I like the way home take I'm there and was too much You know 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.560
 But I did not do such things as much as possible 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.820
 What is likely to have subsequent demands of the audience 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.400
 Suggestions for dependence 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.400
 I'm heart won that say so that you can
