point what I'm working with someone new
I<00:03:21.120> don't<00:03:21.239> care<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.320> most

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
I don't care it's just the most

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.930 
I don't care it's just the most
important<00:03:22.920> thing<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.340> most<00:03:23.430> important<00:03:23.820> thing

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
important thing the most important thing

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
and the shoulder blades squeeze because

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.509 
and the shoulder blades squeeze because
that's<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.330> goal<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.780> exercise<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.400> so

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
that's the goal of this exercise and so

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.009 
that's the goal of this exercise and so
it's<00:03:29.640> just<00:03:29.700> pulling<00:03:30.000> squeeze<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.720> pull<00:03:30.900> and

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.390 
it's just pulling squeeze and pull and
squeeze<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.590> that's<00:03:31.739> we're<00:03:31.920> trying<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.250> do

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
squeeze and that's we're trying to do

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.979 
squeeze and that's we're trying to do
actually<00:03:32.880> look<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.060> chicken<00:03:33.570> ants

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
actually look like chicken ants

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
actually look like chicken ants
that's<00:03:34.320> right<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.250> great<00:03:35.489> thing<00:03:35.519> about

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that's right now the great thing about

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.520 
that's right now the great thing about
these<00:03:35.970> rubber<00:03:36.269> bands<00:03:36.570> these<00:03:36.840> elastic<00:03:37.320> bands

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
these rubber bands these elastic bands

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.120 
these rubber bands these elastic bands
is<00:03:38.190> they<00:03:39.090> kind<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.630> duplicate<00:03:40.230> tendons<00:03:41.040> and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
is they kind of duplicate tendons and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.160 
is they kind of duplicate tendons and
ligaments<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:42.299> as<00:03:42.450> tendons<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.870> ligaments

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
ligaments just as tendons and ligaments

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.930 
ligaments just as tendons and ligaments
stretch<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:43.890> bit<00:03:44.070> these<00:03:44.370> bands<00:03:44.640> stretch

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
stretch a little bit these bands stretch

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.150 
stretch a little bit these bands stretch
a<00:03:45.060> little<00:03:45.360> bit<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.200> instead<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.680> having<00:03:46.890> a

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
a little bit so instead of having a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.520 
a little bit so instead of having a
machine<00:03:47.820> or<00:03:48.269> some<00:03:48.600> metal<00:03:48.959> or<00:03:49.110> something<00:03:49.410> like

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
machine or some metal or something like

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.440 
machine or some metal or something like
that<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.549> hard<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.820> cold<00:03:51.090> we<00:03:51.299> got

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
that that it's hard and cold we got

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.120 
that that it's hard and cold we got
these<00:03:51.570> nice<00:03:51.780> bands<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.470> are<00:03:52.500> very<00:03:52.769> much<00:03:52.950> like

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
these nice bands that are very much like

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.009 
these nice bands that are very much like
the<00:03:53.310> tendons<00:03:53.640> ligaments<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.090> our<00:03:54.209> body<00:03:54.390> they

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
the tendons ligaments in our body they

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.390 
the tendons ligaments in our body they
help<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.380> little<00:03:55.590> bit<00:03:55.799> different<00:03:56.220> bands

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
help out a little bit different bands

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.160 
help out a little bit different bands
are<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> more<00:03:57.390> resistance<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.049> they're

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
are the more resistance and they're

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.890 
are the more resistance and they're
absolutely<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.700> this<00:04:00.060> baby<00:04:00.330> band

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900

the<00:04:12.480> black<00:04:12.660> band<00:04:12.930> they<00:04:13.019> never<00:04:13.200> see<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.410> one

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.039 
the black band they never see that one
that<00:04:13.860> one's<00:04:14.100> scary<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:15.299> as<00:04:15.480> they<00:04:15.959> get

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
that one's scary but as they get

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.870 
that one's scary but as they get
stronger<00:04:16.350> we<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.709> go<00:04:16.979> from<00:04:17.190> one<00:04:17.400> resistance

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
stronger we can go from one resistance

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.849 
stronger we can go from one resistance
to<00:04:18.060> another<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.510> another<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.770> they

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
to another to another and then if they

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.890 
to another to another and then if they
get<00:04:20.010> even<00:04:20.789> stronger<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.419> it's<00:04:21.599> time<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.780> take

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
get even stronger then it's time to take

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.000 
get even stronger then it's time to take
them<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.289> gym<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.620> get<00:04:22.710> them<00:04:22.860> on<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010

them in the gym and get them on the
seated<00:04:23.280> cable<00:04:23.460> roll<00:04:23.789> machine
