 I promised when I got the new one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
 pc had until then not yet 21 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.759
 1000 is a rocket to test that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 I cabinet even these specially not 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.949
 like to try it anyway 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 it's the biggest, after all, biggest 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.240
 supposedly biggest plane i know 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.810
 not if that's true 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 I'll tell you the fact that I am 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.790
 sometime a relatively good infected 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:43.469
 have this rocket already on yellow 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.739
 ranks age is so loud e-mail has 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.500
 the thing is creating 850 parts on pc 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.610
 and stays that is developed 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.770
 clearly understandable and back is yes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 unfortunately, do not go now youtube 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 did not take packed in the please 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.469
 pack description 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.549
 but it does not bring anything here now 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.340
 claim is my first name I can 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.340
 my fabian as always 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.710
 The city first hold synonymous sums 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 i feel in time of my old pcs 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 reset 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.230
 yes that's gross this thing i would 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 you said no direct 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.400
 use purpose except just that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:39.450
 it just great i will take this video 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.860
 I do not have to do that for much longer 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 promised to make that I can 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.650
 tell you already in the old pc 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.380
 I would not have tried that first 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.700
 need I did not do 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.350
 I got you a way on the new pc 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.280
 running a new pc can already do that 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.280
 take off at all 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:05.009
 So as you can ask rolled sit there or 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 my god was not off this land 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.190
 needs a longer land but were 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.780
 otherwise it takes off but not 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 But the team wants to land 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.050
 Also in the background thunder hears us 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 straight wins nothing about the station 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.360
 so crutches will not work 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.200
 six times more detail is crass without end 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.380
 just look how high I serve the battery 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.380
 can 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.820
 it covers all that too 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.600
 thunderstorms help the superstructures 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.340
 This will be good for your children too 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 at least for you right now 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.900
 terminate with and slide with it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.180
 somehow you'll ever do that again 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.440
 must be calculated and then 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.440
 bring the main tip away 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.940
 Old Swede at this time 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.940
 it is blatantly it is correct right degree 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.800
 As I said here , mine fly me 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.640
 minute supposedly the video is ok 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:36.690
 the bonus is about three minutes 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.690
 you are not very bitter 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.750
 that is fierce that is really 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.769
 of course, the thing has perhaps find 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.269
 I'm looking forward to the flame from that 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.269
 is funny coming 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.690
 we are still a bit so now 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.770
 We should actually have the air 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.890
 actually go out not so much 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.459
 text seems it comes last to playout 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.459
 stays through 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:20.440
 122 km h so much fat away 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.340
 come the card of claims everything 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.240
 should talk 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.620
 we are still over 30,000 he is good and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.620
 now the administration 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.650
 increase 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.620
 the thing is practically uncontrollable 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.620
 is has so many fans 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:13.900
 the claims are beautiful 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.070
 okay that was a great test flight autumn 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.600
 I had my promise 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.270
 We kept the promise 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.370
 people and we have the big plus 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.660
 a huge part 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:30.070
 We look at the people you think 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.870
 can you imagine like that 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.750
 We look to go once see whether 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:40.120
 one of the party 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:42.310
 because maximus ride comes are 869 that 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.820
 does not really matter the biggest 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.580
 plane is or if it is even bigger 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.600
 There is absolutely awesome it made 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.650
 Of course, this is a crazy job 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.960
 determined 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.920
 the parts to wait for others is also 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.730
 still can fly is natural 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.020
 awesome cool 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.060
 I am very happy about the submission 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.800
 While I'm doubtful that he does 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:08.410
 Test her on his bed better 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.970
 as I could because I honestly I 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.280
 my yes, there are the same 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.700
 calculator as mine very clear but mine 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.580
 has a lot of power in it and that 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.500
 is already measured severely 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.750
 I wish you I am looking forward to 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.950
 the next time turn on again 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.950
 there my name is loud
