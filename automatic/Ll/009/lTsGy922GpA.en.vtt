00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
opened it and the reason why we open it

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.839 
opened it and the reason why we open it
is<00:05:34.439> because<00:05:34.770> we<00:05:34.889> wanted<00:05:35.159> all<00:05:35.339> these<00:05:35.490> extra

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.459 
is because we wanted all these extra
folders<00:05:36.270> over<00:05:36.509> here<00:05:36.629> so<00:05:36.779> it<00:05:36.900> created<00:05:37.379> a

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
folders over here so it created a

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.230
