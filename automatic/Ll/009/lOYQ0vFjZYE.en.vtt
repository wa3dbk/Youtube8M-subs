00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 Other weapons suitable in which I you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.830
 show how in the caliber 300 knockout 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.509
 unlocked for the professional 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 first needed the professional of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.949
 1 1 and 2 like this you will get to know 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 in my unlock guide to mac 10 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.390
 gun in which I already explained this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 So you've met those 21 so then 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 Do you still have the professional sin 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 do a kit job and this is him 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.080
 perhaps the most demanding 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.579
 most difficult in the whole game 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 First you have ten weapons or 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.300
 Buy gadgets for this class as well 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.800
 to reach the first gold 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.570
 You can easily achieve this through 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.309
 Leveling is best suited for this purpose 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.140
 blood money or team deathmatch 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.730
 you also need 200 kills 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 a sniper rifle what else 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.670
 the simplest task is because now comes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 only really thick 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 You have to have 15 camera crews as well 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 get marksman cross 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 for the chamberlain coins you have to with the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.289
 kämmerer götschl in a round each 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 always 10 against that then wait from 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 teammates are killed 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.930
 This is indicated by the display intel it is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 at each keel indicated the difficult 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.409
 this is an ali this spot again 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
 can write with his own over 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.189
 and he goes out but there is one 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 small but fine trick we right 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.250
 you can quickly pass through this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 an opponent with the taser 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 strike down and then afterwards 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 but before you have to interrogate one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.520
 imagine a camera 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 because by this all opponents become the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 now be done almost as of yours 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.100
 camera the spotted scored a marc 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.259
 You have sven koller if you are in one 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 round in 250 meter long headshots 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.909
 but do not worry that means 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 not that you have a single 52 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.450
 meter rushes create need for this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.340
 the cards do not get big at one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.110
 Rather, you can do this distance 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.479
 also achieve something with many short ones 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.729
 as for example 10 times 25 meters 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.140
 headshots who this is too stupid can 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.000
 of course, just a colleague 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.799
 ask if he is somewhere quiet 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 but it should be 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.369
 honestly over short 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 or long work best is suitable 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.630
 For this the cards are blocked or direct 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.399
 in game mode team deathmatch as 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.320
 Last you have to ten again 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.030
 times the fourth level of the application 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.890
 Achieve and here should be the best 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 in rottweil on a nearly empty server 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.340
 with a corresponding xp boost 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 play since the first big patch 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.000
 There are even special private servers 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.540
 who specialize in it or you 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.760
 asks 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.409
 a friend if he is a hacker squad 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.879
 you want to upgrade too 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.859
 finally done then stand with you 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.569
 the knockout one of the best matching 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.640
 Hardware available at a distance 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.439
 of up to 50 meters it is enough namely 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.060
 out if you the opponent somewhere on 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.069
 Body almost hits what I already have 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.230
 Sniper again feels the call of duty 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.640
 In addition, a switch mind is moderate 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.500
 on the weapon and can not yet 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.970
 you will not be picked up 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.739
 the mini e mail will be displayed when 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.120
 you fired a shot unfortunately 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.489
 but also a disadvantage with 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.079
 a measly 300 meters per second has the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.730
 knock out a pretty small ball 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.470
 speed what especially on 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.819
 slightly larger distances very noticeable 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.470
 because I have to do this one already 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.669
 have a good feeling like much higher 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.470
 to dress or 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.209
 at the moving target as far as the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.739
 but must give the foreman shot 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.349
 if that was not the case then we would have 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.209
 with the lot also an absolute weapon and 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.280
 that's not what she thinks in my eyes 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.109
 because first of all, my own already has to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.700
 be very good to be against others 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.590
 exist because if the first shot 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.629
 it is not difficult to sit in one 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.370
 against one and secondly you have to like 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.319
 said on higher distance still that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.209
 drop the balls into the calculations 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.979
 50 meters you need one 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.629
 headshot for a one hit kill in the 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.430
 At the end of the day you play the strengths of 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.530
 Knockout then perfect if you as 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.239
 aggressive sniper plays so speak 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.829
 not from the last corner on the edge of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.329
 map but open near the 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.229
 opponent runs and with quick scopes the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.090
 kilians retracts 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.370
 whether you are here with a little the call of 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.079
 duty snipers wanted to get into the boat can 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.970
 everyone answer for themselves but 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.620
 just because of the rather small 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.359
 cards in hallein is for me the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.010
 The only sniper that loosens me 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.690
 would play regularly for that 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.459
 remaining sniper rifles simply 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.500
 there is not enough room for the opponent 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.359
 as that they strengthen their legal 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.549
 could show which ones like them 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.229
 limited only by your own taste from us 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.180
 personally , however, have weaker ones 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.859
 visier best as secondary 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.959
 I would definitely go for the mac 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.120
 10 gun recommend the on short 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.919
 distance is an absolute beast and the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.209
 you automatically unlock with 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.069
 one relaxes the ones he plays for 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.419
 you can draw more info to the mac 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.019
 Of course you also have my guide 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.819
 look at 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.139
 According to rumors, the developers want 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.150
 in one of the next patch is the 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.799
 requirement for the camera coins and the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.699
 reach the fourth reputation level 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.530
 tone down 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.519
 So if it was too exhausting so far 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.560
 maybe he should do it a bit more 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.299
 But it's worth it to wait 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.680
 definitely unlock it 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.340
 makes a lot of fun with the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.570
 knockout to distribute the quick scopes 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.440
 if money fell through these weapons 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.820
 Of course, then I would as well 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.110
 very happy with 1 sorry of you 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.220
