00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
okay so here's my little problem we have

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay so here's my little problem we have
mazdaspeed3<00:00:03.540> 2008<00:00:04.470> never<00:00:05.040> really<00:00:05.339> given<00:00:05.549> me

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
mazdaspeed3 2008 never really given me

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.730 
mazdaspeed3 2008 never really given me
much<00:00:05.790> trouble<00:00:06.029> it's<00:00:06.330> been<00:00:06.480> pretty<00:00:06.690> good<00:00:06.899> uh

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

Saturday I'm driving around and the
driver<00:00:11.040> side<00:00:11.280> window<00:00:11.460> goes<00:00:11.940> down<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.929> will

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
driver side window goes down but will

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.210 
driver side window goes down but will
not<00:00:13.740> come<00:00:14.040> back<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.450> so<00:00:15.450> um<00:00:16.070> here<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.190> are

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
not come back up so um here we are

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130 
not come back up so um here we are
yanking<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> door<00:00:18.210> panel<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:18.660> checking<00:00:19.020> out

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
yanking the door panel off checking out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.630 
yanking the door panel off checking out
what's<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:20.250> I've<00:00:20.310> already<00:00:20.550> checked

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
what's going on now I've already checked

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
what's going on now I've already checked
the<00:00:20.789> switches<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.210> everything<00:00:21.600> inside<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the switches and everything inside of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.529 
the switches and everything inside of
here<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> panel<00:00:23.279> itself<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.210> all

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
here on the panel itself these are all

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
here on the panel itself these are all
good<00:00:24.810> they're<00:00:25.140> clean<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:26.279> checked<00:00:26.550> voltage

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
good they're clean I've checked voltage

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
good they're clean I've checked voltage
you<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.539> continuity<00:00:27.840> everything<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.949> work

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
you know continuity everything they work

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
you know continuity everything they work
great<00:00:29.490> every<00:00:30.150> single<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.289> fact<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
great every single time in fact you can

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.250 
great every single time in fact you can
also<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.440> down

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
also see right now if I go down

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.540 
also see right now if I go down
especially<00:00:37.260> let<00:00:37.649> me<00:00:37.710> turn<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
especially let me turn down the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
especially let me turn down the
voltmeter<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:40.010> go<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:42.110> get<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> nice

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
voltmeter here I go down I get a nice

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
voltmeter here I go down I get a nice
little<00:00:43.800> eleven<00:00:44.399> point<00:00:44.640> nine<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.200> twelve<00:00:46.200> volts

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
little eleven point nine to twelve volts

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.430 
little eleven point nine to twelve volts
where<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.770> give<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.010> take<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:49.230> get

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
where we give or take go back up we get

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.279 
where we give or take go back up we get
also<00:00:50.070> eleven<00:00:50.370> onto<00:00:50.610> now<00:00:50.910> forth<00:00:51.210> notice<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
also eleven onto now forth notice it is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.779 
also eleven onto now forth notice it is
a<00:00:52.320> negative<00:00:52.890> twelve<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> down<00:00:53.610> position

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
a negative twelve in the down position

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.220 
a negative twelve in the down position
and<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:55.050> positive<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:56.969> position<00:00:57.230> which

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and a positive in the up position which

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
and a positive in the up position which
indicates<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.100> reversing<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
indicates that it's just reversing the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
indicates that it's just reversing the
polarity<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> voltage<00:01:00.180> thus<00:01:01.050> making<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
polarity of the voltage thus making the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
polarity of the voltage thus making the
motor<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.949> down<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> turning<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.480> way

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
motor go down and up and turning one way

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
motor go down and up and turning one way
or<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.840> okay<00:01:04.650> let's<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> step

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
or the other okay let's take it a step

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.130 
or the other okay let's take it a step
further<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.710> check<00:01:07.710> even<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.340> amperage<00:01:09.140> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
further here check even the amperage now

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
further here check even the amperage now
go<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.610> about<00:01:11.610> four<00:01:12.299> amps<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.560> go<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:14.659> in

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
go down about four amps if I go up in

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
go down about four amps if I go up in
the<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.869> position<00:01:16.250> four<00:01:17.250> point<00:01:17.490> seven<00:01:17.640> four<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the up position four point seven four so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.789 
the up position four point seven four so
it's<00:01:18.439> good<00:01:19.439> voltage<00:01:19.650> good<00:01:20.460> amperage

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
it's good voltage good amperage

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's good voltage good amperage
everything<00:01:22.799> works<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:24.180> far

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
everything works as it should is as far

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.789 
everything works as it should is as far
as<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:27.380> plug<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.700> motor

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.319 

you'll<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:38.329> perfect

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you'll see that when we go down perfect

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
you'll see that when we go down perfect
nice<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.570> smooth<00:01:40.079> works<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> should<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.670> we

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
nice and smooth works as it should if we

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.389 
nice and smooth works as it should if we
go<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.899> hesitate<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.250> bit

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
go up it hesitate there a little bit

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
go up it hesitate there a little bit
let's<00:01:47.579> try<00:01:47.729> again<00:01:49.340> completely<00:01:50.340> dead<00:01:51.740> board

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
let's try again completely dead board

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.230 
let's try again completely dead board
good<00:01:53.070> back<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.460> why<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.000> rolling

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
good back so that's why it's not rolling

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
good back so that's why it's not rolling
it<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.840> okay<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:59.070> natural<00:01:59.520> instinct<00:01:59.939> here

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it up so okay the natural instinct here

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.959 
it up so okay the natural instinct here
is<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> say<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.500> guy<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.799> bad<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.790> gone

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is to say well this guy is bad it's gone

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
is to say well this guy is bad it's gone
out<00:02:03.149> worn<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.600> whatever<00:02:03.960> hey<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.829> been

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
out worn out whatever hey it's been

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.160 
out worn out whatever hey it's been
eight<00:02:05.130> years<00:02:05.159> or<00:02:05.729> six<00:02:06.000> years<00:02:06.210> excuse<00:02:06.479> me<00:02:06.659> it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.550 
eight years or six years excuse me it's
had<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.530> run<00:02:07.740> okay<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> did<00:02:10.440> what

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
had a good run okay well so I did what

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.589 
had a good run okay well so I did what
any<00:02:10.590> mother

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
any mother

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.899

person will do decide to take this thing

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.039 
person will do decide to take this thing
and<00:02:16.250> get<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.310> replacement<00:02:17.609> one<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.750> here's<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
and get a replacement one so here's the
