00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
spark plug um change one wire a spark

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.719 
spark plug um change one wire a spark
plug<00:01:31.240> wire<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:32.560> look<00:01:32.710> at<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.890> drys<00:01:33.070> perfectly

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
plug wire see look at it drys perfectly
