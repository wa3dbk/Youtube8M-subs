00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.500
 it is certainly the most advanced 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.230
 smartphones the latest model of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 at samsung galaxy s 4 full of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 novelties but are they all useful 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 and up to the price of this device 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 that's what we wanted to know in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.789
 taking it in hand before our test in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.789
 laboratory 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 same material same size even looks at 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.800
 first glance we could 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.830
 easily confuse the galaxy s 4 with 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.570
 his predecessor the s3 samsung has everything from 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.400
 even managed to the team and a screen of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 almost 5 inches a little bit 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.660
 bigger than the s3 and he has 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.580
 slightly modified its shape of the blow 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.520
 can not reuse his former coach 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.330
 inside the s4 benefit from everything 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.430
 what is best 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.570
 the most powerful processor ever 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.720
 integrated smartphone 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.190
 the latest version of the android system 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.620
 as well as a photo sensor of 3 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.890
 megapixels and a front camera of 2 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.610
 megapixels it incorporates 2 gigabytes of 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.649
 RAM 16 32 or 64 GB of storage 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.410
 internal expandable with a card 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.570
 memory the last generations of 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.369
 wifi and bluetooth but also the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.399
 contactless technology nfc 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.810
 and of course he is ready for the 4g of 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.509
 blow the phone is perfectly 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 responsive and in addition thanks to this bar 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.830
 vertically one quickly accesses 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.729
 main applications 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.049
 the other innovation is the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.330
 motion recognition 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.280
 just pass your hand in front of the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.850
 front sensor to scroll through the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.220
 photos navigate the web pages or 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.659
 take a call but the system is 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.659
 still sometimes a little wayward 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 thanks to the air view you can access 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.210
 additional information in 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.760
 flying over the screen like on a galaxy 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.930
 note 2 but this time without a stylus just 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.640
 with even more amazing finger the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.650
 galaxy s cut is automatically 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.980
 pause when the user is not looking 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.960
 plus a video and smart function 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.180
 scroll scrolls pages 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.670
 internet with the movement of the eyes and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.380
 wrist finally that's for the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.940
 theory because in practice it does not work 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.620
 not always very well and it happens 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 sometimes the device goes a little bit 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.860
 that he wants 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.099
 but fortunately we can turn off his 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.959
 functions up also makes you part 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.090
 beautiful to the photo we can for example 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.410
 inserted into a single shot the views 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.410
 front and back of the device 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.870
 samsung has joined the same course in zeal 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.819
 than that of the galaxy camera with 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.450
 several features never seen on 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.790
 a phone 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.440
 we can discover on one 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.720
 cliche with decomposed movements 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 or take a picture and add to it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.480
 a few seconds sound this is a 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.480
 green fund 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.190
 fun options but not always 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 simple to handle and not necessarily 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 of great use 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.070
 thanks to the group application play on 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 can also play his music or play 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.870
 together between several galaxy s 4 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.910
 located nearby and the device integrates 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.230
 a health assistant who not only compliments 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.420
 we do in the day and the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.370
 calories burned an app 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.300
 nice but not essential she 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.660
 no more functions like that 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.580
 galaxy s 4 is packed with this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.140
 samsung phone wanted to show any 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.480
 the extent of his know-how 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 but in the end we discover rather a 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.070
 accumulation of gadgets that a real 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.690
 revolutionary smartphone 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.610
 despite all the s4 has all the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.160
 characteristics of the right device like 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.160
 are for example the sony xperia z or 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.200
 the htc one he even gives a serious blow 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.040
 from old to iphone 5 released there 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.230
 only a few months 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.460
 our lab tests will confirm or 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.460
 not his first impressions
