that I just got today I've got one

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.910 
that I just got today I've got one
behind<00:00:28.570> there<00:00:28.900> which<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.259> stripped<00:00:29.560> out<00:00:29.740> for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
behind there which I stripped out for

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.000 
behind there which I stripped out for
parts<00:00:30.279> because<00:00:31.200> it<00:00:32.200> wasn't<00:00:32.470> working<00:00:32.770> for<00:00:32.800> some

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
parts because it wasn't working for some

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.819 
parts because it wasn't working for some
reason<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:34.510> wasn't<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> power<00:00:35.050> supply<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.469> think

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
reason it wasn't a power supply I think

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.130 
reason it wasn't a power supply I think
it<00:00:35.920> had<00:00:36.010> a<00:00:36.040> dead<00:00:36.250> motherboard<00:00:36.760> but<00:00:37.750> yeah<00:00:37.930> this

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
it had a dead motherboard but yeah this

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.819 
it had a dead motherboard but yeah this
one<00:00:38.379> I<00:00:38.530> stripped<00:00:38.890> it<00:00:38.980> out<00:00:39.070> apart<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:41.350> had

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
one I stripped it out apart and I had

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.279 
one I stripped it out apart and I had
another<00:00:42.190> one<00:00:42.520> with<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.059> same<00:00:43.360> machine<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:43.930> I

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
another one with the same machine and I

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.869 
another one with the same machine and I
gave<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:44.620> my<00:00:44.770> mum<00:00:44.980> downstairs<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.730> she

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.810 
gave it to my mum downstairs and she
uses<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.390> on<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.780> daily<00:00:47.140> basis<00:00:47.590> for<00:00:47.860> word

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
uses it on a daily basis for word

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.189 
uses it on a daily basis for word
processing<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.360> internet<00:00:49.690> browsing<00:00:49.870> and

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
processing and internet browsing and

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.920 
processing and internet browsing and
it's<00:00:50.289> a<00:00:50.350> very<00:00:50.559> smooth<00:00:50.800> machine<00:00:51.100> for<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.399> so<00:00:52.239> I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
it's a very smooth machine for that so I

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.560 
it's a very smooth machine for that so I
had<00:00:53.680> another<00:00:53.890> two<00:00:54.100> guys<00:00:54.340> from<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.149> same<00:00:55.300> place

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
obviously with these ones I have no use

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.850 
obviously with these ones I have no use
for<00:01:03.160> them<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.780> there's<00:01:05.019> anything<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.740> know

that I can have from them I will take
them<00:01:10.270> I'll<00:01:10.690> test<00:01:10.990> them<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.290> I'll<00:01:11.770> install

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

going to have a quick look inside the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.540 
going to have a quick look inside the
computers<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:26.890> bear<00:01:27.040> with<00:01:27.070> me<00:01:27.250> while<00:01:27.520> I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
computers so bear with me while I

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.290 
computers so bear with me while I
unscrew<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.060> screws<00:01:29.190> okay<00:01:30.190> so<00:01:30.460> all<00:01:30.910> four

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
unscrew the screws okay so all four

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.140 
unscrew the screws okay so all four
screws<00:01:31.600> are<00:01:31.840> out<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:33.070> two<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.820> each<00:01:33.910> of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
screws are out that's two in each of

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.110 
screws are out that's two in each of
course<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.900> let's<00:01:35.080> pop<00:01:35.350> open<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:36.670> door<00:01:36.880> and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
course so let's pop open the door and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.670 
course so let's pop open the door and
see<00:01:37.270> what<00:01:37.300> we've<00:01:37.510> got

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.130 

okay<00:01:41.680> let's<00:01:41.980> lie<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.430> flat<00:01:42.820> down<00:01:43.060> -<00:01:43.300> it's<00:01:43.450> easy

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.780 

okay<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.560> looks<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.370> my<00:01:48.670> other

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
okay so it looks just like my other

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.630 
okay so it looks just like my other
machines<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.680> only<00:01:50.860> difference<00:01:51.160> in<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.400> one

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
machines the only difference in this one

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.940 
machines the only difference in this one
is<00:01:51.850> we<00:01:52.060> actually<00:01:52.480> have<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:53.020> Wi-Fi<00:01:53.650> card

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is we actually have a Wi-Fi card

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.280 
is we actually have a Wi-Fi card
installed<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.670> PCI<00:01:55.000> slot<00:01:55.390> as<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.050> can<00:01:56.170> see

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
installed in the PCI slot as you can see

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.010 
installed in the PCI slot as you can see
back<00:01:56.470> here<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.310> Wi-Fi<00:01:57.910> antenna<00:01:58.420> that's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
back here we have a Wi-Fi antenna that's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.360 
back here we have a Wi-Fi antenna that's
gonna<00:01:59.200> come<00:01:59.440> in<00:02:00.960> come<00:02:01.960> in<00:02:01.990> handy<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:03.220> that's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
gonna come in come in handy so that's

pretty good here we have a Radeon 7500

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.499 
pretty good here we have a Radeon 7500
definitely<00:02:09.610> not<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.759> best<00:02:09.849> graphics<00:02:10.330> card

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
definitely not the best graphics card

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
definitely not the best graphics card
it's<00:02:10.630> got<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> 64<00:02:11.170> Meg's<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.590> graphics<00:02:11.980> memory

the job for a few hours

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.100 
the job for a few hours
things<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.970> pretty<00:02:17.150> damn<00:02:17.360> dusty<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.870> here

things it's pretty damn dusty in here

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.680 
things it's pretty damn dusty in here
can<00:02:18.620> feel<00:02:18.800> sort<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.100> bits<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.210> bobs<00:02:20.360> around

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
can feel sort of bits and bobs around

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.710 
can feel sort of bits and bobs around
and<00:02:20.870> I'm<00:02:20.930> moving<00:02:21.170> my<00:02:21.260> hand<00:02:22.030> here<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.420> an

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and I'm moving my hand here we have an

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and I'm moving my hand here we have an
80<00:02:24.050> gigabyte<00:02:24.590> IDE<00:02:25.010> hard<00:02:25.460> drive<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.620> can

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
80 gigabyte IDE hard drive and you can

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.070 
80 gigabyte IDE hard drive and you can
see<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> floppy<00:02:28.190> drive<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.700> there<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.870> we<00:02:29.990> have

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
see a floppy drive up there here we have

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.630 
see a floppy drive up there here we have
a<00:02:30.110> heat<00:02:30.470> sink<00:02:30.800> for<00:02:31.100> our<00:02:31.630> AMD<00:02:32.630> Athlon<00:02:33.140> XP<00:02:33.830> it's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
a heat sink for our AMD Athlon XP it's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.180 
a heat sink for our AMD Athlon XP it's
probably<00:02:35.180> about<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.350> rest<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.920> them<00:02:37.010> are<00:02:37.100> at

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
probably about the rest of them are at

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.340 
probably about the rest of them are at
1.67<00:02:37.880> gigahertz<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.600> gather<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.020> one's<00:02:39.230> at

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
1.67 gigahertz so I gather this one's at

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.590 
1.67 gigahertz so I gather this one's at
the<00:02:39.380> same<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.180> have<00:02:41.330> our<00:02:41.450> RAM<00:02:41.920> no<00:02:42.920> idea

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
the same here we have our RAM no idea

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.050 
the same here we have our RAM no idea
what<00:02:44.600> Ram<00:02:45.010> configuration<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.430> has<00:02:46.700> probably

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
what Ram configuration this has probably

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.860 
what Ram configuration this has probably
512<00:02:47.960> at<00:02:48.200> point<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.590> 256<00:02:49.130> s<00:02:49.490> or<00:02:49.790> my<00:02:50.300> mum's<00:02:50.570> did

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
512 at point to 256 s or my mum's did

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.920 
512 at point to 256 s or my mum's did
have<00:02:51.020> two<00:02:51.200> 512<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.370> we'll<00:02:52.580> find<00:02:53.120> out<00:02:53.270> very<00:02:53.330> soon

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
have two 512 so we'll find out very soon

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.800 
have two 512 so we'll find out very soon
and<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:54.740> our<00:02:55.040> DVD<00:02:55.580> drive<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.120> power

okay so it looks like I'm not I think I
have<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.329> do<00:04:02.450> some<00:04:02.629> researching<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.290> some

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
have to do some researching of some

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:16.360 
have to do some researching of some
beeps<00:04:14.560> no<00:04:15.560> problem<00:04:15.890> at<00:04:16.009> all

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
beeps no problem at all

beeps no problem at all
we've<00:04:16.910> got<00:04:17.090> one<00:04:17.239> machine<00:04:17.509> which<00:04:17.750> needs<00:04:18.049> a

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
we've got one machine which needs a

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.949 
we've got one machine which needs a
little<00:04:18.289> bit<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.590> looking<00:04:18.799> at<00:04:19.780> we're<00:04:20.780> gonna

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
little bit of looking at we're gonna

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.230 
little bit of looking at we're gonna
unplug<00:04:22.120> all<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.360> these<00:04:23.479> cables<00:04:23.930> now<00:04:25.090> which<00:04:26.090> is

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
a bit of a pain and we're gonna test the

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.550
