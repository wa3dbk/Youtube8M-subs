times and what's causing it now this is

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.330 
times and what's causing it now this is
a<00:00:55.149> species<00:00:55.719> that<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.050> really<00:00:56.379> have<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.559> hunt

a species that you really have to hunt

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.569 
a species that you really have to hunt
for<00:00:59.129> this<00:01:00.179> is<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.359> bird's<00:01:01.570> nests<00:01:01.899> of<00:01:02.109> dog<00:01:02.289> it

for this is the bird's nests of dog it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.730 
for this is the bird's nests of dog it
and<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.730> can<00:01:03.879> see<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.239> not<00:01:04.839> all<00:01:04.900> orchids<00:01:05.530> are

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
and you can see that not all orchids are

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100 
and you can see that not all orchids are
big<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> glamorous<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.750> one<00:01:07.900> of<00:01:08.020> the

big and glamorous this is one of the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.530 
big and glamorous this is one of the
kind<00:01:08.410> of<00:01:08.470> quiet<00:01:09.370> beauties<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.000> Britain's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
brown has no green and so because it

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.250 
brown has no green and so because it
can't<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:17.980> sunlight<00:01:18.490> energy<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.900> actually

can't get sunlight energy it actually

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.710 
can't get sunlight energy it actually
has<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.530> get<00:01:20.650> its<00:01:20.800> food<00:01:21.480> from<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:22.600> ground

whole<00:02:33.510> plant<00:02:35.540> upload<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.870> image<00:02:37.230> onto<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
whole plant upload your image onto the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
whole plant upload your image onto the
website<00:02:38.810> fill<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.050> details<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
website fill in the details on the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.520 
website fill in the details on the
recording<00:02:41.400> scheme<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:43.319> data

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
recording scheme and I think the data

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800 
recording scheme and I think the data
will<00:02:43.709> come<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:44.099> us<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:45.269> project<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.780> really

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
will come to us this project is really

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.270 
will come to us this project is really
important<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.920> way<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.040> people

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
important because it's a way for people

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.610 
important because it's a way for people
to<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:48.060> involved<00:02:48.209> with<00:02:48.510> citizen<00:02:48.900> science<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
to get involved with citizen science and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.280 
to get involved with citizen science and
just<00:02:50.430> learn<00:02:50.819> about<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.300> science<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.840> orchids

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
just learn about the science of orchids

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.370 
just learn about the science of orchids
and<00:02:52.500> contribute<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:54.959> can

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and contribute to that if we can

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.809 
and contribute to that if we can
understand<00:02:55.860> how<00:02:56.010> climate<00:02:56.250> change<00:02:56.700> is

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
understand how climate change is

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.000 
understand how climate change is
affecting<00:02:56.940> all<00:02:57.390> kids<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.799> that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
affecting all kids we can take that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
affecting all kids we can take that
knowledge<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.700> help<00:02:59.910> us<00:03:00.090> build<00:03:00.330> into<00:03:00.750> an

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
knowledge and help us build into an

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.199 
knowledge and help us build into an
understanding<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.560> how<00:03:01.709> whole<00:03:02.340> habitats<00:03:03.000> like

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
understanding of how whole habitats like

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.660 
understanding of how whole habitats like
this<00:03:03.569> are<00:03:03.840> being<00:03:04.080> affected<00:03:04.680> by<00:03:04.799> these<00:03:04.860> changes

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
this are being affected by these changes

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.539 
this are being affected by these changes
so<00:03:06.299> all<00:03:06.630> kids<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.950> springboard

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
so all kids are really the springboard

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.880 
so all kids are really the springboard
to<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:09.510> understanding<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.319> changes<00:03:10.799> in

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
to really understanding how changes in

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.180 
to really understanding how changes in
the<00:03:10.980> climate<00:03:11.370> are<00:03:11.730> affecting<00:03:12.180> our<00:03:12.269> wildlife

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
the climate are affecting our wildlife

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:40.070 
the climate are affecting our wildlife
so<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.819> there<00:03:14.849> and<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.630> snappy

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.140
