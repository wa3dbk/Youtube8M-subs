wisdom and this one deals with weather
now<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:22.119> cannot<00:00:23.119> speak<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.740> everywhere<00:00:25.160> on<00:00:25.279> the

now I cannot speak to everywhere on the

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.259 
now I cannot speak to everywhere on the
planet<00:00:26.949> but<00:00:27.949> I<00:00:27.980> can<00:00:28.310> speak<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.850> hearing<00:00:29.150> the

planet but I can speak to hearing the
south<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.890> believe<00:00:31.310> that<00:00:31.340> this<00:00:31.730> will<00:00:32.570> apply

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
south and I believe that this will apply

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.530 
south and I believe that this will apply
to<00:00:34.100> most<00:00:34.809> weather<00:00:35.809> most<00:00:36.320> rain<00:00:37.059> storms<00:00:38.059> like

I've got a storm coming toward me now in
a<00:01:01.309> nutshell<00:01:01.629> what<00:01:02.629> happens<00:01:03.140> is<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:05.119> column<00:01:05.540> of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
a nutshell what happens is the column of

warm air moist air rises a it gets to a

warm air moist air rises a it gets to a
point<00:01:09.560> gets<00:01:09.979> too<00:01:10.250> heavy<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:12.049> starts

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
point gets too heavy and it starts

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.010 
point gets too heavy and it starts
falling<00:01:12.799> down<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.220> coming<00:01:13.580> rain<00:01:15.010> that

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
falling down in the coming rain that

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.690 
falling down in the coming rain that
action<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.230> coming<00:01:18.560> down<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:18.980> this<00:01:19.280> when<00:01:19.610> it

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
action of coming down like this when it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.350 
action of coming down like this when it
hits<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.030> ground<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.930> spreads<00:01:21.680> out<00:01:22.090> like<00:01:23.090> that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
hits the ground it spreads out like that

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.250 
hits the ground it spreads out like that
it<00:01:23.930> goes<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.470> far<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:26.120> know<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.600> comes<00:01:26.900> down

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
it goes so far you know it comes down

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.030 
it goes so far you know it comes down
hits<00:01:28.190> turns<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:29.660> it<00:01:29.810> gets<00:01:29.990> sucked<00:01:30.650> back

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
hits turns and then it gets sucked back

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.850 
hits turns and then it gets sucked back
as<00:01:31.310> an<00:01:31.610> updraft<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.690> goes<00:01:33.080> back<00:01:33.320> up<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.620> the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
as an updraft and goes back up to the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.920 
as an updraft and goes back up to the
top<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.580> cloud<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> cloud<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.780> in

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
top of the cloud so the cloud is in

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.710 
top of the cloud so the cloud is in
essence<00:01:36.320> doing<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:38.170> okay<00:01:40.150> now<00:01:41.150> how<00:01:41.659> does

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
essence doing this okay now how does

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560 
essence doing this okay now how does
that<00:01:42.080> apply<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:42.890> me<00:01:43.040> at<00:01:43.909> ground<00:01:44.420> level

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that apply to you and me at ground level

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.470 
that apply to you and me at ground level
if<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:46.190> are<00:01:46.750> standing<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:49.730> storm<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.270> in

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
if you are standing here the storm is in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.690 
if you are standing here the storm is in
front<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.890> wind<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.280> coming<00:01:52.490> from

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
front of you the wind is coming from

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.370 
front of you the wind is coming from
your<00:01:53.120> back<00:01:53.420> going<00:01:54.229> toward<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.770> storm<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:57.020> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
your back going toward the storm that is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.250 
your back going toward the storm that is
beyond<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.820> rain<00:01:59.090> limit<00:01:59.510> beyond<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.900> squall

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
beyond the rain limit beyond the squall

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.780 
beyond the rain limit beyond the squall
line<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> air<00:02:01.130> being<00:02:02.030> sucked<00:02:03.790> get

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
line that's the air being sucked get

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.360 
line that's the air being sucked get
centered<00:02:05.060> up<00:02:05.150> there<00:02:05.299> being<00:02:06.290> sucked<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.070> going

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
centered up there being sucked and going

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.119 
centered up there being sucked and going
up<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.670> outside<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.659> cloud<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.140> rolling

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
up the outside of the cloud that rolling

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.309 
up the outside of the cloud that rolling
is<00:02:10.340> causing<00:02:11.180> suction<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.840> pulling<00:02:12.170> air

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
is causing suction and pulling air

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.580 
is causing suction and pulling air
toward<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:14.060> flows<00:02:14.540> toward<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.319> cloud

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
toward it so it flows toward the cloud

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
toward it so it flows toward the cloud
and<00:02:16.010> then<00:02:16.430> goes<00:02:16.640> up<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.180> draft

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
and then goes up that draft

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.940 
and then goes up that draft
so<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.450> storm<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.080> front<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
so the storm is in front of you the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.470 
so the storm is in front of you the
wind's<00:02:21.250> coming<00:02:21.310> from<00:02:21.580> your<00:02:21.880> back<00:02:22.090> going

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
wind's coming from your back going

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.560 
wind's coming from your back going
toward<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.280> are<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.240> rain

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
toward it you are not in the rain

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.980 
toward it you are not in the rain
pattern<00:02:26.820> then<00:02:27.820> suddenly<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.480> wind<00:02:28.720> suddenly

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
pattern then suddenly the wind suddenly

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.600 
pattern then suddenly the wind suddenly
goes<00:02:29.320> willy-nilly<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.100> goes<00:02:30.280> from<00:02:30.400> every

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
goes willy-nilly and goes from every

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.950 
goes willy-nilly and goes from every
different<00:02:30.730> direction<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.630> suddenly

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
