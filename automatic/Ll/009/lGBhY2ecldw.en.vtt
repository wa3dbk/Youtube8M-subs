00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
not gonna use the white and also I think

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.910 
not gonna use the white and also I think
if<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.270> add<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.600> white<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.500> will<00:05:45.560> look<00:05:45.770> a

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
if I add the white to it it will look a

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.690 
if I add the white to it it will look a
little<00:05:46.160> too<00:05:46.310> weird

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
little too weird

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.370 
little too weird
the<00:05:46.820> yellow<00:05:47.030> is<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.300> contrast<00:05:47.720> now<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.320> the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
the yellow is the contrast now and the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.440 
the yellow is the contrast now and the
white<00:05:48.590> would<00:05:48.800> almost<00:05:48.950> be<00:05:49.190> too<00:05:49.220> much<00:05:49.730> so<00:05:50.420> I
