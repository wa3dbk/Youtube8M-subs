00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.830 
they were all cringing and making funny
faces<00:04:02.980> when<00:04:03.430> they<00:04:03.519> heard<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.940> cracks<00:04:04.420> one

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
thing I find sometimes in my sleep if I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.060 
thing I find sometimes in my sleep if I
roll<00:04:06.940> over<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.450> do<00:04:07.570> something<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.170> my<00:04:08.320> back<00:04:08.590> how

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
roll over I do something to my back how

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.740 
roll over I do something to my back how
did<00:04:09.250> Joe<00:04:09.400> Montana<00:04:09.820> come<00:04:10.150> back<00:04:10.360> from<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
did Joe Montana come back from the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.539 
did Joe Montana come back from the
operation<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:11.739> his<00:04:11.920> back<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.370> play

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
operation in his back to play

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.850 
operation in his back to play
professional<00:04:13.269> football<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:14.170> was<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.680> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
professional football it was it was to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.010 
professional football it was it was to
repair<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> disc<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.630> think<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
repair a disc and and I think the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.690 
repair a disc and and I think the
amazing<00:04:17.500> thing<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.770> surprised<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.459> lot<00:04:18.580> of

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
amazing thing that surprised a lot of

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.800 
amazing thing that surprised a lot of
people<00:04:18.910> about<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.270> is<00:04:19.390> that

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
people about it is that

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.479 
people about it is that
came<00:04:19.900> back<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.350> soon<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:21.130> are<00:04:21.160> some<00:04:21.340> people

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
came back so soon there are some people

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.300 
came back so soon there are some people
who<00:04:21.760> obviously<00:04:21.970> never<00:04:22.389> come<00:04:22.600> back<00:04:22.750> at<00:04:22.930> all

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
who obviously never come back at all

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.430 
who obviously never come back at all
there<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.550> theory<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.180> perhaps<00:04:25.480> if<00:04:26.080> Joe

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
there is a theory that perhaps if Joe

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.409 
there is a theory that perhaps if Joe
had<00:04:26.680> seen<00:04:26.920> Nick<00:04:27.250> sooner<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.910> maybe<00:04:28.210> he

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
had seen Nick sooner that maybe he

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.790 
had seen Nick sooner that maybe he
wouldn't<00:04:28.660> have<00:04:28.720> had<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.020> undergo<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> surgery

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
wouldn't have had to undergo the surgery

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.940 
wouldn't have had to undergo the surgery
although<00:04:30.270> Nick<00:04:31.270> tends<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.290> discount<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.860> he

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
although Nick tends to discount that he

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.710 
although Nick tends to discount that he
says<00:04:33.100> that's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.430> entirely<00:04:33.910> true<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.600> it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
says that's not entirely true that it

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.690 
says that's not entirely true that it

depends on depends on the situation but

depends on depends on the situation but
every<00:04:37.180> single<00:04:37.360> one<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.660> these<00:04:37.810> guys<00:04:38.020> go<00:04:38.560> to
