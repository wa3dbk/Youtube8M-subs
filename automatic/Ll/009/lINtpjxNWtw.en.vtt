00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.930
 hi friends we find ourselves 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.300
 today for a new tutorial on 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.250
 the exosomes mode be so this tutorial in 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.689
 what will it consist of I'm going all 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.850
 just show you and you 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.550
 explain how to accomplish the secret of 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.130
 this break the first map exodo biden in 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.500
 face the audacity to accomplish this secret in 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
 solo so I do not have much 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.570
 else to tell you it's gone 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.190
 chained have goals away with the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.930
 first step that will consist of 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.879
 recover that black box that is getting 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.469
 found at the spawn so at the back of the bus 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.390
 in this little corner where there is debris 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.649
 you press the actions key of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.329
 your controller and the little black box 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.370
 will appear at the bottom left of your 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.289
 screen and we go with the tops 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.760
 number two then in this second 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.350
 step it will have to be active and five 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.820
 generators that is on the map 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.070
 so the first one we saw that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.280
 find at the spawn that activate the exodus 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.650
 doctor 31 years ago not the same the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.930
 second that activate the exo reload 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.540
 so in the morgue 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.220
 I searched for no the third one that activates 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.159
 the exos combination the violets 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 the fourth that activate the exo on the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.619
 dahe the exo health the little one who is 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.280
 find in the dom that activate the exo 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.280
 crushing 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 and for tops number 3 you go 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.010
 go to the morgue 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 in front of this computer which I remember 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.970
 the one where one activates and the generators 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 to urge it loading you go 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 put yourself in front of this computer and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.040
 press the action key and from there 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.540
 you will be able to see the black box 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 that you have to pick up in the first 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.860
 step that will appear along the pc one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 now go to step number 4 in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 to report may need to purchase 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.850
 the exo crush that is in the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.740
 dom near the spawn once you have 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.170
 bought this exo skills we will get 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.330
 go to the room near the exo health 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.650
 where there are these little cells and in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 one of these cells we will have to 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.690
 recover a card to go here is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.640
 so go for that you will you 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.840
 put his side and you shot this 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 ground like I 'm trying to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.440
 do until the blackjack cylinder where 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.440
 it disappears completely 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.490
 so sailing then we can see that he has 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 completely gone from jacks and flat 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.720
 once it's done you go 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 jump on the cell there you did 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 a double jump and then a crash 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.840
 on the cell where you farted the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 jack the cell with the card goes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.250
 go up and you will be able to recover 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.690
 the beh 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.120
 good I hope I expressed myself well 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.460
 that you have understood the thing for 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.200
 step number 5 we will go to 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.060
 an empty garbage me I advise you 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.740
 the one that predicts spawn then you have a 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.730
 time you go back we go 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.770
 press a second time you go 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.330
 you drop you're going to land 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.260
 in this alone I tell you done 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.840
 to have a machine gun 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.490
 you shot on the ground until you see a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 map he's going to fly so do 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.700
 attention sometimes it's true sometimes 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.730
 big we create we saw the map 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 fly and we can pick it up and to be 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
 sure to have picked up the four 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.050
 kept on your map at the bottom left 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.230
 there is a little number 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 so in the beginning it is marked 0 and as 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.020
 and as you recover the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.710
 resident cards goes back there so its 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.460
 second card 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.140
 these numbers 2 it makes sense for the stage 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.690
 next you will have to find the m 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.880
 in the laser printer the 3d printer 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.770
 So that's really the stroke of luck that 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.020
 can last a long time I messed up 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.970
 secrets because of that it's really a 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.580
 chance step once you have 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.410
 7th 1 in hand you will come back 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.330
 the 3d printer you will shoot on 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.040
 the printer is then pressed 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.920
 accusation for as if you wanted 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.880
 nam and there a map will appear and 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.770
 you will be able to take it 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.380
 it makes us a third small card 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.850
 number 3 at the bottom of the screen the step hurt 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.560
 to happen during the round 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.240
 disinfect you have before you do 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.860
 infect as I do not shut up take a 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.300
 simply pie 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.580
 and you will have to activate four 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.070
 buttons pressed four keys so 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.330
 the first one you put in front of that 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.820
 go green is that it's good you 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:24.300
 support the second they are all 4.2 m 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.550
 becoming the 3rd and the 4th once on this 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.020
 button press the hatch right next goes 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.790
 open but before you go you have to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.720
 disinfect 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.400
 then head to seven 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.440
 open trappists and you can 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.890
 retrieve the fourth card that we 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.890
 needed 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.180
 for step number 8 you have everything 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.350
 just have to kill zombie do 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.790
 are going to live have dropped cards 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.760
 of members brew his cards up 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.270
 reach the number 49 at the bottom left 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.040
 on your card 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.420
 once the 49 card reaches for 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.240
 move on to the next step that will be 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.130
 different depending on your character so 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.200
 if you have bill you're going to have to 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.150
 interact with a digicode that is found 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.190
 near the bridge near the area of 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.680
 contamination 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.270
 then if you have the girl I do not know 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.110
 more than what it's called it seems to me 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.150
 that its limits 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.890
 so if you have the elite it will take 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.230
 interact with the digicode that is 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.740
 find at the morgue in the ground just 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.030
 after where there is exo reloading 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.860
 then if you have clerics that's 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.870
 pass in the hexagon he'll have to 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.570
 go in this staircase to his little cage 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.660
 staircase is right 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.180
 here and finally for the last darling 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.550
 so my character is going on in the 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.530
 private health exo if housing six 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.760
 statistics 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.200
 once you have questioned 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.560
 your case we find ourselves for the 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.990
 after 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.540
 So here we are at the 10th and last 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.250
 stage of which a first time we will 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.690
 make it to go to the morgue forgiveness and 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.060
 interact with this pc 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.250
 we will still discuss blablater 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.080
 once you did that 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.430
 you will go back to 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.390
 the hexagon to interact with an ego a 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.850
 exoskeleton as if you wanted in 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.740
 take one of there you'll hear a 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.640
 eco earth and have a music that goes 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.960
 start and we end up spawn a 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.600
 false good despite simply 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.210
 to be able to observe the rescue team 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.800
 just for you to see them powers 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.300
 drop by orbital dock 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.310
 so there we will not see I could not 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.230
 as you can see a little bit the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.840
 brothel I could not record this moment 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.820
 there but the secret well done as you 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.130
 can see him succeed locked five 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.750
 ans said end of part 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.580
 so here are the people so I hope 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.040
 that these tutorials will have pleased you I hope 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.930
 to have been pretty clear enough explicit 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.480
 if that's the case let me know 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.280
 with one he has a comment and on 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.910
 this legs I tell you very soon 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.910
 go ciao
