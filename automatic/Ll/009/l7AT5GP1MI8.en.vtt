or armor and so on today my field it's
very<00:04:00.400> slightly<00:04:00.850> reduced<00:04:01.209> not<00:04:01.810> very

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
very slightly reduced not very

but<00:04:06.970> yes<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.840> system<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.260> shield<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.620> quite

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
but yes the system of shield is quite

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.050 
but yes the system of shield is quite
nice<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:10.030> reminds<00:04:10.420> me<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.570> so-called<00:04:11.700> an<00:04:12.700> awful

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
nice it reminds me of so-called an awful

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.920 
nice it reminds me of so-called an awful

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
lot of them space Sims actually but

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.009 
lot of them space Sims actually but
generally<00:04:17.519> 3d<00:04:18.519> first-person<00:04:19.150> ones<00:04:19.750> rather

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
generally 3d first-person ones rather

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.260 
generally 3d first-person ones rather
than<00:04:20.350> this<00:04:20.410> type<00:04:20.680> it's<00:04:21.400> nice<00:04:21.519> because<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:22.030> does

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
than this type it's nice because it does

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.150 
than this type it's nice because it does
mean<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.690> end<00:04:22.960> up<00:04:23.080> having<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.860> manage

mean that you end up having to manage

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.530 
mean that you end up having to manage
your<00:04:24.250> shields<00:04:24.640> so<00:04:24.910> you<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.270> only<00:04:25.390> take

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
your shields so you can only take

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.730 
your shields so you can only take

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
a little bit odd because the game does

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.409 
a little bit odd because the game does
encourage<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.949> switch<00:06:21.159> sides<00:06:22.059> every<00:06:22.360> so

leveling up within a faction and your

show try and show you the way that you
can<00:06:40.749> transfer<00:06:41.199> sentience<00:06:41.710> between<00:06:42.009> the<00:06:42.099> games

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:42.309 
can transfer sentience between the games

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:44.339 
can transfer sentience between the games
because<00:06:42.669> fusion<00:06:42.999> sentient<00:06:43.419> is<00:06:43.599> a<00:06:43.659> strategy

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
because fusion sentient is a strategy

using this game as your units as your
actual<00:06:50.919> combat<00:06:51.639> unit<00:06:51.939> so<00:06:52.779> as<00:06:53.080> they<00:06:53.259> level<00:06:53.439> up

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
actual combat unit so as they level up

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.709 
actual combat unit so as they level up
in<00:06:54.339> this<00:06:54.580> game<00:06:54.699> you<00:06:54.969> can<00:06:55.029> then<00:06:55.210> transfer<00:06:55.569> them

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
in this game you can then transfer them

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.320 
in this game you can then transfer them
to<00:06:55.930> fusion<00:06:56.319> sentient<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.039> they'll<00:06:57.999> be<00:06:58.180> more

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
to fusion sentient and they'll be more

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.179 
to fusion sentient and they'll be more
powerful<00:06:58.629> there<00:06:59.099> unfortunately<00:07:00.099> these

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
powerful there unfortunately these

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:02.040 
powerful there unfortunately these
servers<00:07:00.580> have<00:07:00.789> a<00:07:00.849> health<00:07:01.120> moment<00:07:01.479> it's<00:07:01.899> been

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
servers have a health moment it's been

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.049 
servers have a health moment it's been
like<00:07:02.229> that<00:07:02.349> all<00:07:02.409> day<00:07:02.529> so<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.610> can't<00:07:03.879> actually

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:04.059 
like that all day so I can't actually

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.700 
like that all day so I can't actually
show<00:07:04.330> you<00:07:04.389> basically<00:07:05.110> you<00:07:05.229> can<00:07:05.379> send<00:07:05.589> it<00:07:05.680> to

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
show you basically you can send it to

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.189 
show you basically you can send it to
yourself<00:07:05.860> to<00:07:06.580> your<00:07:06.610> own<00:07:06.839> as<00:07:07.839> if<00:07:08.020> you<00:07:08.110> are

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
yourself to your own as if you are

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.540 
yourself to your own as if you are
setting<00:07:08.469> up<00:07:08.529> an<00:07:08.680> auction<00:07:08.830> as<00:07:09.189> if<00:07:09.279> you're<00:07:09.399> going

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
setting up an auction as if you're going

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.489 
setting up an auction as if you're going
to<00:07:09.669> sell<00:07:09.879> it<00:07:09.909> to<00:07:10.029> random<00:07:10.539> people<00:07:10.629> you<00:07:11.139> just<00:07:11.349> set

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:11.499 
to sell it to random people you just set

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:13.409 
to sell it to random people you just set
it<00:07:11.620> to<00:07:11.740> send<00:07:11.979> it<00:07:12.069> to<00:07:12.099> your<00:07:12.339> own<00:07:12.490> gamertag<00:07:13.180> and

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
it to send it to your own gamertag and

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.429 
it to send it to your own gamertag and
then<00:07:13.960> it<00:07:14.110> will<00:07:14.199> arrive<00:07:14.409> as<00:07:14.589> a<00:07:14.620> message<00:07:15.069> in<00:07:15.339> the

00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:16.439 
then it will arrive as a message in the

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:18.629 
then it will arrive as a message in the
fusion<00:07:17.439> sentient<00:07:17.949> game<00:07:18.129> and<00:07:18.339> allow<00:07:18.490> you<00:07:18.550> to

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
fusion sentient game and allow you to

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.850 
fusion sentient game and allow you to
receive<00:07:18.909> it<00:07:19.059> there<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.419> it<00:07:20.259> works<00:07:20.409> both<00:07:20.589> ways

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
receive it there and it works both ways

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.369 
receive it there and it works both ways
so<00:07:21.189> with<00:07:21.460> infuse<00:07:21.729> incentives<00:07:22.120> you<00:07:22.330> can<00:07:22.479> level

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:23.379 
so with infuse incentives you can level

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:25.649 
so with infuse incentives you can level
up<00:07:23.499> your<00:07:23.680> units<00:07:23.979> in<00:07:24.099> that<00:07:24.279> game<00:07:24.520> or<00:07:25.240> you<00:07:25.539> can

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:25.659 
up your units in that game or you can

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:27.029 
up your units in that game or you can
just<00:07:25.810> return<00:07:26.020> a<00:07:26.080> character<00:07:26.860> you've<00:07:26.949> been

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 
just return a character you've been

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.800 
just return a character you've been
using<00:07:27.189> sentient<00:07:28.180> you've<00:07:28.270> been<00:07:28.389> using<00:07:28.539> that

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
using sentient you've been using that

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.779 
using sentient you've been using that
diffusion<00:07:29.529> genesis<00:07:30.039> and<00:07:30.219> then<00:07:30.339> use<00:07:30.520> a<00:07:30.550> fully

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
diffusion genesis and then use a fully

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.389 
diffusion genesis and then use a fully
leveled<00:07:31.029> up<00:07:31.240> high<00:07:31.839> quality<00:07:32.379> drone<00:07:33.870> so<00:07:34.870> the

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:35.399 
leveled up high quality drone so the

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.079 
leveled up high quality drone so the
implementation<00:07:36.399> of<00:07:36.459> that<00:07:36.520> is<00:07:36.669> actually<00:07:36.759> quite

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:37.089 
implementation of that is actually quite

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:40.379 
implementation of that is actually quite
nice<00:07:37.209> when<00:07:37.899> the<00:07:38.169> server's<00:07:38.499> working<00:07:39.240> this<00:07:40.240> is

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389 
nice when the server's working this is

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.829 
nice when the server's working this is
just<00:07:40.539> a<00:07:40.659> weird<00:07:41.020> glitch<00:07:41.849> and<00:07:42.849> it's<00:07:43.599> quite<00:07:43.810> a

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:43.839 
just a weird glitch and it's quite a

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.869 
just a weird glitch and it's quite a
pretty<00:07:44.080> game<00:07:44.289> it's<00:07:45.099> not<00:07:45.249> the<00:07:45.310> most<00:07:45.490> complex

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 
pretty game it's not the most complex

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.399 
pretty game it's not the most complex
and<00:07:46.029> it's<00:07:46.209> not<00:07:46.330> the<00:07:46.419> best<00:07:46.629> written<00:07:46.839> game<00:07:47.110> world

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.409 
and it's not the best written game world

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.040 
and it's not the best written game world
but<00:07:47.589> it<00:07:47.680> is<00:07:47.770> quite<00:07:48.129> fun<00:07:48.459> and<00:07:48.870> it's<00:07:49.870> available

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050 
but it is quite fun and it's available

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.509 
but it is quite fun and it's available
on<00:07:50.439> the<00:07:50.830> Xbox<00:07:50.919> Live<00:07:51.339> Arcade<00:07:51.430> Marketplace<00:07:52.180> now
