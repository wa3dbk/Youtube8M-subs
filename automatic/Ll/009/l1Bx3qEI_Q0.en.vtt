00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello very good today I have an elusive 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.720
 good 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.639
 in which 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 I will explain how it transforms a way 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 source of sales of a computer 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.320
 a battery hood with jacks to see if 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.080
 worth 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.939
 can be used to light a cigarette or 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.220
 to be able to plug in many devices here 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.440
 what is there today that works in 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.600
 blind 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.780
 I bet I do not want to enter everything is divided 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.780
 you pay 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 two 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.679
 since the above 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.499
 622 6 volts plus 22 amps 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.960
 and here is what he can certify 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.840
 that the previous 90 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 we need here to put a hit them and 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.559
 with the fast 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.280
 and make the songs so we can 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.370
 live 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.590
 and he lost double position and this as 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.960
 kind of fiber optic that this edge 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.600
 Warrior law as a song as 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.710
 those irons is generated equal without 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.950
 emirato blanco bueno was in veloso 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.869
 the future lion in 10k science 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.750
 to reduce the 10 volt portal 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.079
 try a discussion on the tab of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.079
 diet 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.730
 the musician the fast 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.600
 and today we go to collections worth 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.600
 good that we have here what 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.760
 and from here 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 the author and your from the stream that 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.220
 this change of entry is formed here 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.580
 in your mind and already with this would work 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 that's good here we have the cable 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.470
 behind smoker to the bridge of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 Diode certifier is worth the caller 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.090
 my plus and minus is worth more and less 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 they always go in kuwait 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.780
 with some cables in certain genres 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 previous 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.320
 and now here is very much the advice this one 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 to stabilize the current a little 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.470
 OK 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.400
 and connected 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.819
 must know with the whole and now we 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.120
 it is here to put the cable 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.940
 from here going out here 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.850
 throat splinters 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.850
 well we have a state also light 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.900
 preserve 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.030
 and there is the cable that comes out if outside that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.880
 where to go to the tweezers is worth nothing 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.090
 we have response to light and attack them 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.959
 a little but the console 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.959
 hold it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.349
 with actions of this type 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.209
 the museum connection I try to keep paying 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.700
 and now let's put a movie to 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.790
 present the system 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.959
 it has not lost any rate 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.750
 around here we are 200 texts with silicone 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.040
 fast 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.640
 and why of things in the house 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.640
 good 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.900
 this has also specified with 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.370
 silicone and let's make the face 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.489
 good 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.069
 it may be the appearance of our source 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.069
 of power that is would be loaded 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.069
 life with all the parameters 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.660
 everything is going to be a car the entire cycle 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.440
 ok and here the cables are going 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.440
 and this is where we will put the tweezers 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.360
 let's come to 106 useful
