tower steel tower let use ten cables to
hold<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.180> tower<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.560> use<00:00:25.920> 12<00:00:26.369> cables

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
hold the tower and then use 12 cables

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.270 
hold the tower and then use 12 cables
holder<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:29.310> service<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.779> bridge<00:00:34.280> very

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
holder for service of the bridge very

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
holder for service of the bridge very
design<00:00:36.590> fishes<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> ships<00:00:38.489> post<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.329> run<00:00:40.230> a

hunter bridge and without any resistance

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.990 
hunter bridge and without any resistance
thus<00:00:46.000> we<00:00:46.360> build<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:47.050> funny<00:00:48.210> kappa<00:00:49.210> bridge<00:00:49.480> here

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
thus we build a funny kappa bridge here

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.960 
thus we build a funny kappa bridge here
similar<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.030> lack<00:00:52.510> big<00:00:53.020> cable<00:00:53.410> bridge<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:54.610> use

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
similar to lack big cable bridge we use

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.190 
similar to lack big cable bridge we use
a<00:00:55.080> public<00:00:56.080> tower<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.210> central<00:00:58.720> position

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
a public tower in the central position

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.670 
a public tower in the central position
and<00:00:59.710> use<00:01:00.490> two<00:01:00.820> cables<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.630> hold<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.350> tower

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
and use two cables to hold this tower

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.000 
and use two cables to hold this tower
and<00:01:03.090> then<00:01:04.090> use<00:01:05.040> eight<00:01:06.040> cables<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.960> connect<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
and then use eight cables to connect the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then use eight cables to connect the
tower<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.880> whole<00:01:10.270> bridge<00:01:10.870> service<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:12.250> so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
tower and the whole bridge service so so

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.490 
tower and the whole bridge service so so
if<00:01:13.450> any<00:01:14.140> fish<00:01:14.440> or<00:01:15.180> water<00:01:16.180> animals<00:01:16.720> under

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
if any fish or water animals under

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.399 
if any fish or water animals under
bridge<00:01:18.070> they<00:01:18.550> will<00:01:18.760> not<00:01:19.060> face<00:01:19.630> any<00:01:19.680> resistance

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
bridge they will not face any resistance

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
bridge they will not face any resistance
and<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.659> trend<00:01:24.830> system<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and we use a trend system to be the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.039 
and we use a trend system to be the
traffic<00:01:27.990> system<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.400> bridge<00:01:29.780> let's<00:01:30.780> see

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
traffic system in this bridge let's see

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.160 
traffic system in this bridge let's see
the<00:01:31.110> motion<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.210> trend

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.580 

openly<00:01:37.170> metric<00:01:37.680> circle<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.580> pen<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.270> go

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
openly metric circle then the pen can go

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.840 
openly metric circle then the pen can go
into<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.009> kettle<00:01:41.580> bridge<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.220> run<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
into the kettle bridge and run in the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
into the kettle bridge and run in the
group<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.350> railway<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:48.200> then<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.530> into

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
group the railway and then go into

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
group the railway and then go into
another<00:01:50.399> bridge<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> traditional<00:01:52.200> steel

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
another bridge it's a traditional steel

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670 
another bridge it's a traditional steel
bridge

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.330 

and<00:01:56.980> then<00:01:57.250> coke<00:01:57.490> back

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and then coke back

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.480 
and then coke back
the<00:01:59.640> faith

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.600 

and<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.240> ate<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.770> noisy<00:02:06.270> light<00:02:07.649> flashlight<00:02:08.649> on

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and we ate a noisy light flashlight on

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.990 
and we ate a noisy light flashlight on
the<00:02:10.060> surface<00:02:10.539> subsurface<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:11.340> power<00:02:12.340> to
