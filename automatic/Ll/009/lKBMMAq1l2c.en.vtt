between 100 and 200 per session okay
that's<00:02:19.319> not<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.879> know<00:02:21.060> 100<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> 200<00:02:22.409> for

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that's not for you know 100 to 200 for

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
that's not for you know 100 to 200 for
maybe<00:02:23.700> four<00:02:24.390> or<00:02:24.420> five<00:02:24.720> sessions<00:02:25.049> no<00:02:25.560> that's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
maybe four or five sessions no that's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.270 
maybe four or five sessions no that's
per<00:02:26.159> session<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.450> say<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.290> five

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
per session so say you have five

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
per session so say you have five
sessions<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.780> pay<00:02:30.989> 200<00:02:32.540> that's<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.629> lot<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
sessions and you pay 200 that's a lot of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.729 
sessions and you pay 200 that's a lot of
money<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.640> that's<00:02:35.640> why<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.500> the

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
was the disc that I used um a little

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.550 
was the disc that I used um a little
water<00:06:09.289> to<00:06:09.380> glide<00:06:09.710> yes<00:06:10.310> but<00:06:10.789> I<00:06:11.180> got<00:06:11.780> done<00:06:11.990> faster

water to glide yes but I got done faster
it<00:06:12.979> only<00:06:13.130> takes<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.789> think<00:06:14.630> using<00:06:14.840> a<00:06:15.080> smaller

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
it only takes I think using a smaller

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.490 
it only takes I think using a smaller
ones<00:06:15.590> they<00:06:15.830> take<00:06:16.100> like<00:06:16.280> maybe<00:06:16.490> 10<00:06:16.789> minutes<00:06:17.500> the

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
ones they take like maybe 10 minutes the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.430 
ones they take like maybe 10 minutes the
bigger<00:06:18.710> one<00:06:18.979> took<00:06:19.580> like<00:06:19.820> five<00:06:20.090> minutes<00:06:20.479> but<00:06:21.110> I

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
bigger one took like five minutes but I

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.920 
bigger one took like five minutes but I
know<00:06:22.190> I<00:06:22.580> don't<00:06:22.669> really<00:06:23.060> recommend<00:06:23.450> using<00:06:23.780> a
