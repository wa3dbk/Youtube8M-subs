00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.249 
inches and it is on bristol paper and
I'm<00:00:09.929> using<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:10.620> pigma<00:00:11.490> microns<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.540> draw<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
I'm using my pigma microns to draw and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.650 
started in days and days and the cold
got<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.920> kind<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.540> killed<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
got to it and it kind of killed the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
got to it and it kind of killed the
battery<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> had<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.520> fixed

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
battery so I had to have that all fixed

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.650 
battery so I had to have that all fixed
and<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.830> needed<00:02:38.250> some<00:02:38.520> new<00:02:38.670> brakes<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> got

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
and I needed some new brakes so I got

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.840 
and I needed some new brakes so I got
that<00:02:39.870> taken<00:02:40.140> care<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.460> hasn't<00:02:41.670> been

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
that taken care of so it hasn't been

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.350 
that taken care of so it hasn't been
very<00:02:42.210> exciting<00:02:42.930> beyond<00:02:43.920> working<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:44.880> my<00:02:45.060> book

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
very exciting beyond working on my book

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
very exciting beyond working on my book
just<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.380> pretty<00:02:46.880> boring<00:02:48.200> kind<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.440> hanging

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
just a pretty boring kind of hanging

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.530 
just a pretty boring kind of hanging
around<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.550> house<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.270> days<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.750> guess<00:02:53.540> so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
around the house kind of days I guess so

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.140 
around the house kind of days I guess so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
tangles as you all know but I've

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.420 
tangles as you all know but I've
included<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.200> my<00:03:16.470> original<00:03:16.950> ones<00:03:17.160> that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
will be in my book in this drawing so I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.730 
will be in my book in this drawing so I
purchased<00:03:26.640> some<00:03:26.760> spectrum<00:03:27.450> noir<00:03:27.930> markers<00:03:27.959> I

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
purchased some spectrum noir markers I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.150 
purchased some spectrum noir markers I
only<00:03:28.920> ordered<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.610> pinks<00:03:30.150> set<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:32.040> because

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
only ordered the pinks set just because

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.850 
only ordered the pinks set just because
I<00:03:32.459> wanted<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.060> try<00:03:33.510> them<00:03:33.720> out<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.230> see<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:34.740> I

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
I wanted to try them out and see if I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.390 
I wanted to try them out and see if I
liked<00:03:35.130> them<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.140> want<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.680> purchase

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
liked them and see if I want to purchase

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
liked them and see if I want to purchase
the<00:03:38.610> whole<00:03:38.790> set<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.450> whole<00:03:39.600> says<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.350> think

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
the whole set and the whole says I think

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.890 
the whole set and the whole says I think
it's<00:03:41.310> close<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.730> three<00:03:41.970> hundred<00:03:42.030> dollars<00:03:42.300> or

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
it's close to three hundred dollars or

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.370 
it's close to three hundred dollars or
something<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.760> definitely<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.360> lot<00:03:45.690> cheaper

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
something so definitely a lot cheaper

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.040 
something so definitely a lot cheaper
than<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.670> were<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.970> go<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.120> go<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:49.940> copics

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
than if I were to go to go with copics

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.220 
than if I were to go to go with copics
but<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.790> don't<00:03:53.790> know<00:03:53.970> I'm<00:03:54.300> still<00:03:54.450> kind<00:03:54.630> of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
but I don't know I'm still kind of

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.980 
but I don't know I'm still kind of
undecided<00:03:55.800> on<00:03:56.160> them<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:56.790> really<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.630> them

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
undecided on them I do really like them

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.140 
undecided on them I do really like them
I<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.560> way<00:03:58.709> they<00:03:58.950> blend<00:03:59.250> they<00:03:59.700> blend<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
I like the way they blend they blend a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.930 
I like the way they blend they blend a
lot<00:04:00.330> easier<00:04:00.810> than<00:04:00.959> sharpies<00:04:01.560> which<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.250> knew

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
lot easier than sharpies which I knew

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.290 
lot easier than sharpies which I knew
they<00:04:03.120> would<00:04:05.240> but<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:07.440> has<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> hard<00:04:08.459> time<00:04:08.580> on

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
they would but it has a hard time on

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.660 
they would but it has a hard time on
cardstock<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.560> kind<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.890> bleeds<00:04:11.190> out<00:04:11.430> and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
cardstock it kind of bleeds out and

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.400 
cardstock it kind of bleeds out and
feathers<00:04:12.030> out<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.239> little<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.780> more<00:04:12.989> than<00:04:13.200> I

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
feathers out a little bit more than I

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.949 
feathers out a little bit more than I
would<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.730> which<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.760> why<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.120> drawing<00:04:15.720> is

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
would like which is why this drawing is

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.150 
would like which is why this drawing is
done<00:04:16.169> on<00:04:16.350> bristol<00:04:16.799> board<00:04:18.410> but<00:04:19.410> Bristol<00:04:19.980> paper

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
done on bristol board but Bristol paper

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.520 
done on bristol board but Bristol paper
as<00:04:20.580> I've<00:04:20.820> mentioned<00:04:21.299> before<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.020> lot<00:04:22.290> more

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
as I've mentioned before is a lot more

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.580 
as I've mentioned before is a lot more
expensive<00:04:22.860> than<00:04:23.340> cardstock<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.410> I'm<00:04:25.410> not

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
expensive than cardstock so I'm not

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.870 
expensive than cardstock so I'm not
really<00:04:25.770> sure

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
really sure

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.910 
really sure
if<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.090> will<00:04:27.360> purchase<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.230> whole<00:04:28.410> set<00:04:28.680> I'm

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
if I will purchase the whole set I'm

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.570 
if I will purchase the whole set I'm
leaning<00:04:29.490> towards<00:04:29.910> yes<00:04:30.770> but<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:32.010> will<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.400> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
leaning towards yes but we will have to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.850 
leaning towards yes but we will have to
see<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:35.630> am<00:04:37.250> purchasing<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.900> new<00:04:39.900> set<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.230> pigma

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
see I am purchasing a new set of pigma

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.340 
see I am purchasing a new set of pigma
micron<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.520> very<00:04:41.820> soon<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.720> is<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> set

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
micron is very soon there is a set

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.520 
micron is very soon there is a set
online<00:04:43.850> which<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.000> will<00:04:45.150> leave<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> link<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.990> down

below for is I think it's like 56

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.290 
below for is I think it's like 56
pigma<00:04:50.730> microns<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.950> there<00:04:52.950> on<00:04:53.130> there<00:04:54.120> for

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
pigma microns and there on there for
