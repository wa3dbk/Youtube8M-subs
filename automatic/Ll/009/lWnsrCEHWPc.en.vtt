is his pelvis right here

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.440

because<00:03:03.469> I<00:03:03.769> needed<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.129> give<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.700> while<00:03:04.999> room

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
because I needed to give a while room

for<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.409> movement<00:03:06.709> which<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:07.760> basically<00:03:09.010> let

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
for this movement which is basically let

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.759 
for this movement which is basically let
him<00:03:10.129> finish<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.790> pendulum<00:03:11.749> that<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.560> swings

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.399 
him finish a pendulum that just swings
back<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.069> forth<00:03:13.359> so<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.389> kind<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.900> created

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
back and forth so I kind of created

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.520 
back and forth so I kind of created
somewhat<00:03:15.829> of<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.010> cage<00:03:16.340> using<00:03:17.180> his<00:03:17.599> bones<00:03:17.959> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
somewhat of a cage using his bones and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.819 
somewhat of a cage using his bones and
his<00:03:19.010> arms<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:19.939> front<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:21.079> give<00:03:21.230> nice<00:03:21.469> free

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
his arms in the front to give nice free

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.069 
his arms in the front to give nice free
movement<00:03:22.189> as<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.239> see<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.510> arms<00:03:23.810> there

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
movement as you can see the arms there

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:32.679 
movement as you can see the arms there
so<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.829> can<00:03:25.069> just<00:03:25.219> shake<00:03:25.459> like<00:03:25.700> crazy<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689 
so I can just shake like crazy but the

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.020 
so I can just shake like crazy but the
movement<00:03:33.340> reverberates<00:03:34.340> all<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.730> way<00:03:34.849> down

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
movement reverberates all the way down

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.569 
movement reverberates all the way down
