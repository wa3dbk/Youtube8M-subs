00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello I am a princess today we will talk 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.309
 about new animatronics named skin cap 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 also he has 2 name sandwich what 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 translated as collector now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 I will explain to you why they call him that, but 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 first friends put likes if 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 want to see more videos on this game 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.600
 and we will start with the fact that the action of the game 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 there will be no pizzeria building out 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 the first or second part is completely in 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.180
 other place since the location of all 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.179
 rooms ioffe is very different from 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 past parts especially with me from if 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.260
 compare it with the office from past parts 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 in the new system not only in the office itself 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 we are in other rooms outside lined 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.899
 tiles on the floor and walls and such rooms 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.180
 with such walls and floor 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.739
 was not in any of the parts possible 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.190
 certainly assume that the workers did 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.110
 repairs 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 but just look at these walls in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.559
 I think the office can be seen on them 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.449
 debt lack of repair 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.680
 however, the sim will look at the trailer and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 bruise screenshots 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.100
 we see that the floor and walls are exactly the same 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 as in the first two parts 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.699
 put a step in 1 floor or not from black 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.559
 white tiles on the walls 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 most likely the owners of the attraction 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.880
 wanted to recreate the atmosphere 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 Freddie fazber pizzerias what is creation 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 yet unknown offer your 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 options in the description of friends and we 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.159
 continue like this is another building 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.869
 but the creators of the attraction visited 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.180
 Pizzerias from the first and second parts of the game 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 and collected everything that survived there for 30 years 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 and bring all that was found in the new 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.549
 country 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.680
 who turned into a horror attraction 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.439
 let's see what they did 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 find I first look at the box with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.180
 animatronic masks which used to be 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 was on the site of scott if light this 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.259
 picture then you can see the parts 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.729
 the animatronics of us two are also next to 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.979
 it is worth a new animatronic 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.009
 and the file with this picture is called 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.149
 weaved reviews translates as we 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.159
 can use 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.899
 maybe this inscription says that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.180
 create will use parts 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.159
 animatronics from this box to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.159
 make other animatronics but about this 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.760
 my friends a little later than the box itself 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.120
 see the mask balun fight 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.340
 ucheke that massacre that freddie and mangle 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.190
 that bonnie 's right hand is part of the endoskeleton 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.690
 mangle guitars that bonny hook foxy and 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.240
 paper plate doll 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.730
 and the very doll that tied off the wall 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 sometimes appeared in the office of the protagonist 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.800
 Well, who is depicted as kai have 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.490
 version that this is a balun bout as both hands and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.770
 doll's feet 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.850
 similar to the color of his shirt looks like so 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.070
 same facial expression 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.670
 and look at the number of buttons and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.410
 a doll creak and a balun fight 2 I personally told me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 this doll resemble puppet 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 but the number of buttons matches and 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.100
 smile is also very similar to the puppet 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.190
 so maybe this doll hints at 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.170
 the fact that the puppet will be 3 parts also on 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.520
 my channel was a video about what scott 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.530
 hid minigame files 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.330
 several puppet pictures also 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.930
 hints at what she will meet 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.150
 parts fnaf 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.850
 Now let's look at the screenshots 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.130
 luminaries camera one of them we see that 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.690
 on the wall mask fire from the first part so 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.000
 as in the second part of his mask 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.040
 missing in this screenshot 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360
 see the foxy mask from the first part so 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.820
 how is his mask whole 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.830
 in fnaf 2 it is damaged by the upper part 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.989
 the following screenshot shows the costume 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.030
 Fredy from the first part because he does not have 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.459
 buttons in the second part of africa 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.800
 their three all animatronics of the first part 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.730
 we have not seen this picture most likely 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.400
 she will too 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.959
 and is somewhere in another room like 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.120
 see the creators of the attraction 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.610
 found almost all animatronics on 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.110
 much you have not seen most likely in 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.420
 other rooms of this attraction 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.640
 there is still a lot of interesting things about 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.500
 this can only be after the game 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.720
 now let's talk about why 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.690
 new animatronic collapse and became jam 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.970
 or a collector as we know something inside 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.519
 sandwich is probably a man 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.220
 most likely a purple man as well 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.930
 like purple guy and background guy is one person 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.360
 then he can reconfigure 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.850
 animatronics therefore there is an option that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.040
 soldiers during the game will be coming in 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.170
 office scare you and collect parts 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.239
 animatronics out of the box to collect 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.040
 them as in the description it is not written that in 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.650
 the game will be one animatronic 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.239
 meaning that a whole is found 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.829
 animatronic so maybe he will 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.159
 collect other animatronics 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.510
 why would he do that you ask mine 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.370
 the theory is that it will collect 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.069
 animatronics and they will be able to move 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.720
 on ventilation as in the box we see 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.639
 animatronics from the second part 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.739
 who were free to move around 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.990
 ventilation attacks with doctors too 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.300
 major ventilation he just does not climb 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.979
 By the way, I have evidence that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.389
 these hidden passages on the map fnaf 3 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.699
 which appears during clarification 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.620
 is a ventilation shaft 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.690
 if you look closely at the screenshot 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 with a new animatronic then you can see 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.800
 closed ventilation on the floor in the hallway i 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.020
 as you can see in the same place on the mini map 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.639
 visible hide and pass so now 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.979
 it became clear that these passes on 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.169
 minimap and just like ventilation and 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.449
 one of the ventilation is at all 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.460
 the main character and through the series rather 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.160
 just animatronics will find fault with 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 the second part of which will assemble a sandwich so 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.340
 as soon as animatronics from natla 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.370
 could use ventilation for 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.430
 displacement for example Mongols taiwan then 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.840
 box phalanx and so on here only 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.789
 how and where the link will collect 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
 animatronics as judging by the box 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.840
 I could not fit all 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.270
 endoskeletons but maybe they are somewhere 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.280
 hidden in the same description says that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.270
 other endoskeletons were found except 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.340
 got better of course 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.560
 however, there are parts of the mangle book in the box 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.360
 that bonnie and foxy hook maybe everything 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.760
 can one find wild even for 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.860
 one animatronic and hear it 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.330
 collect but for a change he will 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.880
 randomly use different masks 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.800
 to screamers storms different and frightened from 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.110
 surprises because I do n't know what 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.880
 this time will come out of the ventilation therefore 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.010
 I think that you require a sandwich and he 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.720
 will bring together one animatronic which 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.940
 will scare you and be able to move 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.580
 through the ventilation and this animatronic 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.210
 integers will collect randomly to 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.909
 every time 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.159
 it was even worse but how do you like this theory 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.260
 friends write your options under this 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.970
 I will be interested in reading the video 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.470
 I hope you liked the release 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.659
 talk about this video with all your 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.120
 friends and acquaintances perhaps they 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.870
 There will be options about this. 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.260
 be sure to put likes 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.060
 buy my vk group 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.780
 where you must subscribe to my channel 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.470
 and wait for the next video wish you success until 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.470
 new meetings
