00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 7 sometimes it's over 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.050
 I therefore issued it exactly 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.220
 always recorded 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 one in seven out of nine 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 in the performance of that 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.630
 it remains of course known as a pot wet 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 Ricky van Wolfswinkel affected 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.560
 during the last week in the capital 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.570
 and then further on the white screen 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 just before that, actually rather anonymous 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 the supporters available in the Netherlands 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 I find this very beautiful 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 anp in the neighborhood 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.330
 if you need a piece of 8 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.190
 then I had not yet so in the new 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690
 that's exactly what those follow 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 made it is really six meters high 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.400
 but that period also goalkeeper 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.260
 most cases 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.180
 the votes 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.510
 that everything was fine 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.110
 that the 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 neither does the ball 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969
 I'll put it on 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.760
 follow now 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.030
 I wanted to boar 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.470
 especially on the stock exchanges 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.090
 is in romania 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.020
 also join 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.180
 we are 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.220
 for weapons 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 that is the highest step 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.730
 the border 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
 she said reason in the marriage car 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 the vets and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440
 exactly 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.010
 in the program 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
 then you can always be committed 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.099
 is 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 really not beautiful 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.609
 it's all right there 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.379
 anyway supports 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
 8 come both times 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.469
 a number of 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.969
 the it is unknown 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.389
 plasterk 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.319
 yes in 2010 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.659
 in the first room 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:34.949
 after an accident 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.069
 also 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.069
 the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.479
 the only 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.999
 I think I am a big one already 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.249
 well come to stand 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.229
 9 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.169
 the
