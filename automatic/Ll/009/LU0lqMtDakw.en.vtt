00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Wimble that have a big advantage because

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
Wimble that have a big advantage because
I'm<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> big<00:01:10.500> serve<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> come<00:01:11.280> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
concentrate so hard I think it was just

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.510 
concentrate so hard I think it was just
the<00:02:12.390> excitement<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:13.080> being<00:02:13.230> in

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
the excitement of being in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.610 
the excitement of being in
for<00:02:13.700> us<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.850> French<00:02:14.240> Open<00:02:14.450> final<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:15.230> any<00:02:15.410> tie

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
I just a big excitement I think mainly a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.500 
I just a big excitement I think mainly a
little<00:02:21.620> nerves<00:02:21.980> were<00:02:22.220> there<00:02:22.520> yeah<00:02:23.210> but<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
little nerves were there yeah but the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.710 
little nerves were there yeah but the
tiebreak<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.410> were<00:02:24.500> down<00:02:24.710> five<00:02:25.070> low<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
tiebreak you were down five low and you

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it's probably with the history the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.500

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
of it I was just thinking if you play

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:42.610 
of it I was just thinking if you play
doubles<00:03:34.500> with<00:03:34.709> Jimmy<00:03:35.220> commas<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.610> definitely

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.440 

but<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> mean<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:44.010> don't<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.760> doesn't<00:03:45.150> distract

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
but I mean you don't it doesn't distract

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.849 
but I mean you don't it doesn't distract
your<00:03:45.659> opponents<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.409> think<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.739> don't

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
your opponents do you think I don't
