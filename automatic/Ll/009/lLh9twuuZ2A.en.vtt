00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello guys hello this is a review for a thousand 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.300
 Aquarium heading 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.980
 today I would like to talk to you and 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:17.250
 tell the thermostat the heating 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.750
 Aquarium water was such a review 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 make on the thermostat firm watercolor 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.119
 100 watt manufacturers recommend 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 insert it from 60 to become water 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.480
 general volume you need 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 to put 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.420
 thermostat calculated enough 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.840
 easy this macro 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.180
 vice versa, I recommend 25 watts from 10 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.220
 up to 15 and so on like this scale 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:56.239
 how many watts per volume is needed here 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.950
 indicated we have an average temperature in 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.290
 what room is the room where 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:06.460
 there is an aquarium and already on such a volume 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.460
 I will tell you how to use it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.840
 instruction 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:44.940
 warranty 2 years thermostat strikes 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 at the bottom of the thermostat such a cap 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.350
 removed this do nothing this in case 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.480
 if o itself from attached suckers 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.470
 will fall to the bottom so as not to develop with us 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.970
 glass mounted 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.050
 such sucker sucker enough 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.760
 fingers in this company 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:11.490
 for a long time here we have an indicator 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.880
 tattoo and setting the temperature you need 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.340
 let's say an average fish needs 27 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.250
 degrees twenty six twenty seven 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 you put 27 degrees now like him 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 enjoys a bitch 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.710
 turn it on only when it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.750
 is in the water it sinks 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.560
 in whole or in strips us with cord 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.620
 either that's why the answer will get 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.709
 fully immerse so if you are by this 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.840
 mark make water to the aquarium if 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.830
 open water will evaporate all 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.590
 less and less ad is very bad 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.980
 connected to the network when it is under 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.970
 water and the red indicator lights up in 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.519
 heating mode and lights up red 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 light bulb as soon as it goes out means 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.630
 he turned off and waited for the water to cool 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.540
 to turn on again 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.790
 here so my glass there are more species 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.860
 plastic plastic is very good not 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.240
