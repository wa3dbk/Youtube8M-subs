ago<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.900> post<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> video<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.680> it's<00:01:48.799> almost<00:01:48.950> up

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
ago I post the video and it's almost up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.649 
ago I post the video and it's almost up
to<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.280> thousand<00:01:49.729> views<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.479> I'm<00:01:50.540> pretty

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
to a thousand views now so I'm pretty

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.560 
to a thousand views now so I'm pretty
pumped<00:01:50.810> about<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.940> vote<00:01:53.119> changed

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
pumped about that but the vote changed

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.880 
pumped about that but the vote changed
in<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.690> middle<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> middle<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.710> week

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
in the middle of the middle of the week

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.399 
in the middle of the middle of the week
and<00:01:55.220> now<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:55.729> one<00:01:56.540> hundred<00:01:56.600> percent<00:01:56.780> crisis

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
and now it's one hundred percent crisis

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.289 
and now it's one hundred percent crisis
so<00:01:57.619> everybody's<00:01:57.979> are<00:01:58.310> not<00:01:58.549> crisis<00:01:58.940> our<00:01:59.150> home

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
so everybody's are not crisis our home

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.399 
so everybody's are not crisis our home
front<00:01:59.510> so<00:01:59.690> everybody's<00:01:59.990> been<00:02:00.110> vote<00:02:00.260> in<00:02:00.350> the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
front so everybody's been vote in the

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.289 
front so everybody's been vote in the
home<00:02:00.500> front<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.920> apparently<00:02:01.670> home<00:02:02.000> front<00:02:02.210> is
