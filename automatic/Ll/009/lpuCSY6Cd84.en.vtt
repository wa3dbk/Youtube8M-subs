00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello I am olivier professor 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.090
 climbed and today I'm going to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 show how to insure someone on 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 a way generally that you go 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 climb you are 2 so there is one who 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 climbs it is he who obviously ensures 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 it's done alternately 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 concerning the insurer is that which 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 holds the climber in other words the one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.519
 that prevent him from falling like the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 climber he is equipped with a harness 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.060
 so the harness 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.800
 there is a heavy responsibility between 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.679
 quotation marks since it ensures survival 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 of climber he has a series of gestures to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.380
 perform well accurate and it goes especially 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 stay very very focused on what he 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 made of most cases for them 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.090
 beginner climbers or for those who 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.760
 climb into a room 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.039
 the agreement will be fixed at the parish 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.950
 so you will have a basic gesture 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.539
 business that will arise in case of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 movement that's how it breaks down 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.530
 the movement that must be performed and the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 almost for all types of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.140
 descender whether it's 1.8 for other 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 thing that 's still the same movement 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.049
 for the right-handed 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.420
 but the hand here the left hand goes on 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.830
 the other rope 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 if we want to swallow 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.869
 in other words pull the rope towards you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 because the climber is serious 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.900
 simply put two parallel strings 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.390
 we shoot with the right arm we lower the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 right arm so we brake because we 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.040
 increases the friction here knowing that he 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.080
 never let go of the right hand 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.530
 we will let go of the left hand come the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.210
 place below the eight for then 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.189
 bring your right hand back 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.689
 once we have executed this 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
 maneuver we can release the hand 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.259
 left put it back on the rope for 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:47.420
 repeat the same movement 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.420
 this movement must be learned by heart 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.590
 the movement is done in four stages 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.860
 first time we just shoot the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.180
 rope 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.280
 the two parallel groups for the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.070
 better to slide them we just slow down 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.860
 so we fold our hand right hand on 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.289
 the back one removes the left hand have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.729
 grabbed the rope here and there we can free 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 the right hand to better search the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.880
 rope higher 1 2 still on the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.940
 braking before removing the left hand 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.709
 3 and 4 so why that's right 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.459
 simply because when the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.250
 climber climbed the rope 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.330
 relaxes and to prevent the fall 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.130
 be too important 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.650
 so we will perform a series of gestures 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.060
 to keep a minimum voltage not too much 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.459
 strong either because it takes no no 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.760
 more helped the climber unless he's 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.130
 really in big trouble but just 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.840
 to avoid a big fall in 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 conclusion you have the movement of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.220
 base to assure anyone that it is 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.200
 indoors or outdoors 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.209
 the only advice I can add 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.660
 again it's at the level of 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.000
 the insurer 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.190
 he must be very attentive to what does 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.350
 his climber to his environment 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.670
 where it is posed and with every gesture 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 techniques he has to perform
