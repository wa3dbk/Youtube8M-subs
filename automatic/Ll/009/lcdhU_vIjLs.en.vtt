00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello, how are you? I'm Paula from Miami 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.110
 as an extension for those who do not 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.340
 you know today I want that tutorial 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.559
 in which I teach them to be a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
 aging with latex and with 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.670
 make all this also because 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.170
 a few days ago it was grandpa's day 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.730
 I leave it with the steps and I hope that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 like the first thing you're going to need 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.810
 is to put Vaseline anywhere 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 where you want to put latex this step is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 super important because it avoids the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.019
 latex sticks to your skin and facilitates 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 make-up remover use liquid latex 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 shake very well and with a sponge and with 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.870
 I tapped it on the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 part of my face that already had Vaseline 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 in this step super important not to do 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 gestures so that the skin is as 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 stretched possible you should wait for 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 dry to put the next layer of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.870
 latex you will realize that dry because 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 this one transparent we apply petroleum jelly 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
 over my eyebrows to protect them and not 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.879
 tear them off when I fainted and came back 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.879
 to apply another layer of latex 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 remember to fill the root well with Vaseline 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.150
 of the hair that is stuck to the face if 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.150
 not really suffer salt is make up 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.450
 let dry and it arrives that is not so 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 sticky so you can wrinkle your 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.670
 front and create many wrinkles 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.380
 when you have done this apply powder with 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.480
 a brush to seal and it will not be 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.480
 chic he quoted looks more or less like that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.610
 repeat the same steps in the / eyebrow 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.790
 I like more Vaseline for the rest of the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 face 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 and I put the athex but this time only in the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.130
 eyelid and where the legs of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 rooster remember to wrinkle this part 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 while the latex dries once it is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.290
 dry up as much as you can this area 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 and the seals with powders is now the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 moment in which the face of duck 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.910
 besucÃ³n that so much good photos does some 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.400
 time served as they stretch to the skin 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.140
 of the cheeks let it be wrinkled 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.640
 with all his strength and sealed with dust 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 repeat the same steps in the chin 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.990
 and nose let it stay with all your 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.000
 forces and seals with dust 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.799
 I paint my hair with white spray and 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.479
 so I stay with pure latex now 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.250
 We will continue with the makeup that will prevent 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.720
 the white appearance that remained in the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.030
 face i used a foundation 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.890
 dark and a thin brush to mark 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.479
 the wrinkles and give more texture to 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.370
 the skin if you do not have a dark base 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.050
 You can use a coffee eyeliner 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.470
 but make it darker than the color of 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.030
 your skin 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.380
 do this in all the wrinkles that 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.150
 They made you 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 paint the eyepiece a little so that the eye 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.940
 he looked more tired and he also painted the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.940
 brown lips 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.870
 apply a base of my tone to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670
 that the wrinkles did not look so 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.319
 artificial and paint the typical 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.880
 spots of age in certain parts 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.560
 of the cheek with the same base coffee 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.850
