science demonstration on the whole idea
that<00:00:04.950> warm<00:00:05.250> air<00:00:05.400> rises<00:00:05.819> cold<00:00:05.850> air<00:00:06.180> sinks<00:00:06.240> and

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
that warm air rises cold air sinks and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.690 
that warm air rises cold air sinks and
it's<00:00:07.140> true<00:00:07.319> for<00:00:07.350> water<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.250> cool<00:00:08.490> thing

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
it's true for water and the cool thing

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.209 
it's true for water and the cool thing
about<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.450> kid<00:00:09.690> friendly<00:00:10.219> kid

and we don't want kids dipping their
hands<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.770> they're<00:00:16.890> coming<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.220> with

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
hands in they're coming out with

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
hands in they're coming out with
third-degree<00:00:17.670> burns<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> safe<00:00:19.500> way

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
third-degree burns we want a safe way
for<00:00:19.800> kids<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> really<00:00:20.670> look<00:00:20.970> at<00:00:21.210> what's

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
for kids to really look at what's

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.080 
for kids to really look at what's
happening<00:00:22.140> analyze<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
happening analyze it think about it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.109 
happening analyze it think about it
again<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.900> again<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.199> again<00:00:25.970> that's<00:00:26.970> what

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
again and again and again that's what

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.990 
again and again and again that's what
science<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> very<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.460> simple

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
science is so we have a very very simple

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
science is so we have a very very simple
setup<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> jar<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
setup here you can see I have a jar of

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.670 
setup here you can see I have a jar of
water<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.640> hot<00:00:32.940> hence<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> red<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
water it's hot hence the red I have a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
water it's hot hence the red I have a
jar<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.250> cold<00:00:35.640> water<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.329> cold<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
jar of cold water it's cold and it's the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
jar of cold water it's cold and it's the
blue<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:37.890> we're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.370> put<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
blue and all we're gonna do is put the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.740 
blue and all we're gonna do is put the
food<00:00:39.120> coloring<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:40.219> take<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> lid<00:00:41.550> off<00:00:41.750> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
food coloring in take the lid off you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.020 
food coloring in take the lid off you
don't<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.640> conservative<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
don't have to be conservative here you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
don't have to be conservative here you
just<00:00:45.210> squirt<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
just squirt it in you want it to be a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.880 
just squirt it in you want it to be a
nice<00:00:47.280> dark<00:00:47.730> deep<00:00:48.210> red<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.170> watch<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.530> quickly

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
nice dark deep red and watch how quickly

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.209 
nice dark deep red and watch how quickly
that<00:00:50.219> red<00:00:50.250> actually<00:00:50.730> disperses<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.219> just

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that red actually disperses and just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
that red actually disperses and just
totally<00:00:53.940> fans<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> water

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
totally fans out in all of the water

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.369 
totally fans out in all of the water
it's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.160> taking<00:00:56.550> long<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.350> compare<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it's not taking long and compare that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.630 
it's not taking long and compare that
with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.859> blue<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> actually

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
with the blue because it's actually

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490 
with the blue because it's actually
interesting<00:01:00.449> scientifically<00:01:01.230> what's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
interesting scientifically what's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
interesting scientifically what's
happening<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.070> squirt<00:01:02.699> some<00:01:02.879> blue<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.210> past

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
happening here squirt some blue and past

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.800 
happening here squirt some blue and past
the<00:01:03.600> ice<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> blue<00:01:06.390> sort<00:01:06.720> of

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the ice you can see the blue sort of

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.370 
the ice you can see the blue sort of
stays<00:01:07.590> together<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.270> spreading<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.170> as

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
stays together it's not spreading out as

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
stays together it's not spreading out as
quickly<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> red<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.450> part

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
quickly as the red that's actually part

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.830 
quickly as the red that's actually part
of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> processes<00:01:13.500> what's<00:01:13.710> happening<00:01:14.220> here

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
of the processes what's happening here

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.999 
of the processes what's happening here
though<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.140> molecules<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> water

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
though the molecules here the water

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.260 
though the molecules here the water
molecules<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.549> heated<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.000> they're<00:01:18.150> moving

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
molecules are heated so they're moving

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
molecules are heated so they're moving
quickly<00:01:18.659> they're<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.320> they're<00:01:19.680> moving

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
quickly they're there they're moving

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
quickly they're there they're moving
moving<00:01:20.220> moving<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.729> actually<00:01:21.000> helping

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
moving moving and it's actually helping

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
moving moving and it's actually helping
to<00:01:21.390> stir<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.869> water<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> can't<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.830> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to stir up that water you can't see it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.600 
to stir up that water you can't see it
it's<00:01:23.670> sort<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:23.970> invisible<00:01:24.210> stirrer<00:01:24.570> here

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
it's sort of an invisible stirrer here

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
it's sort of an invisible stirrer here
it's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.790> moving<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.240> quickly<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.810> see

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's not moving so quickly you can see

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.359 
it's not moving so quickly you can see
it's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.350> spreading<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's not really spreading out there so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's not really spreading out there so
I'm<00:01:29.460> gonna<00:01:29.549> speed<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.450> straw

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I'm gonna speed it up with my straw

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.280 
I'm gonna speed it up with my straw
stir<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.540> stir<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.020> here

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
stir it up there stir this one up here

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.100 
stir it up there stir this one up here
make<00:01:35.159> sure<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.880> ready<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
make sure it's good and ready now what I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.319 
make sure it's good and ready now what I
want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.850> create<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.930> column<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
want to do is create a column of

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
want to do is create a column of
separation<00:01:42.329> between<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> two<00:01:43.079> colors<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.590> see

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
separation between the two colors to see

what<00:01:43.860> happens<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> real<00:01:45.119> simple

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
what happens and it's a real simple

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
what happens and it's a real simple
principle<00:01:46.049> we've<00:01:46.229> all<00:01:46.409> done<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.920> soda

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
principle we've all done this with soda

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
principle we've all done this with soda
stick<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> straw<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.329> your<00:01:48.360> soda<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.960> your

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
stick the straw in your soda put your

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.480 
stick the straw in your soda put your
thumb<00:01:49.259> over<00:01:49.290> top<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> pull<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
thumb over top and pull it out and the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
thumb over top and pull it out and the
soda<00:01:50.729> stays<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> straw<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
soda stays in the straw well that's a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
soda stays in the straw well that's a
different<00:01:52.860> scientific<00:01:53.340> concepts<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.030> we're

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
different scientific concepts so we're

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
different scientific concepts so we're
focusing<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.740> simple<00:01:56.070> concept

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
focusing here on just one simple concept

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.609 
focusing here on just one simple concept
so<00:01:56.909> I'm<00:01:57.000> gonna<00:01:57.090> start<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.020> hot<00:01:58.320> water

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
so I'm gonna start with the hot water

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.389 
so I'm gonna start with the hot water
first<00:01:59.360> dip<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.659> put<00:02:01.350> my<00:02:01.500> thumb<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.799> top<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
first dip it in put my thumb on top and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.929 
first dip it in put my thumb on top and
tada<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.750> staying<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.770> now<00:02:05.520> here's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
tada it's staying in there now here's

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.119 
tada it's staying in there now here's
the<00:02:06.119> magic<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.350> magic<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.770> science

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the magic and it's not magic at science

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.729 
the magic and it's not magic at science
I'm<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> move<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> over<00:02:09.599> put<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.379> straw

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
I'm going to move it over put my straw

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.660 
I'm going to move it over put my straw
deeper<00:02:11.310> into<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> blue<00:02:11.879> let<00:02:12.420> my<00:02:12.599> thumb<00:02:12.900> off

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
deeper into the blue let my thumb off

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.030 
deeper into the blue let my thumb off
put<00:02:14.120> my<00:02:14.240> thumb<00:02:14.510> back<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.260> trap<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.860> water

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
put my thumb back on and trap the water

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
put my thumb back on and trap the water
inside<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.490> sounds<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.120> complicated<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:17.990> it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
inside it sounds so complicated but it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.610 
inside it sounds so complicated but it's
not

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
not

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.400

beautiful now if I leave this sit long
enough<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.820> temperatures<00:02:47.300> will<00:02:47.420> leave<00:02:47.570> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
enough the temperatures will leave it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.500 
enough the temperatures will leave it
out<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.080> they'll<00:02:48.620> start<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.010> mix<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.209> see

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
out and they'll start to mix you can see

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.940 
out and they'll start to mix you can see
it<00:02:50.630> sort<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.020> starting<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.380> happen<00:02:51.620> right<00:02:51.890> in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
it sort of starting to happen right in

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
it sort of starting to happen right in
the<00:02:52.070> middle<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.489> cool<00:02:52.700> what<00:02:53.239> if<00:02:53.330> we<00:02:53.450> reverse

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the middle it's cool what if we reverse

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.990 
the middle it's cool what if we reverse
it<00:02:54.050> that's<00:02:54.980> where<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.340> see<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.519> science

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
it that's where you see the science

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.729 
it that's where you see the science
happen<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.810> I'm<00:02:56.930> gonna<00:02:57.019> start<00:02:57.350> with<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> cold

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
happen so I'm gonna start with the cold

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.949 
happen so I'm gonna start with the cold
and<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:58.220> into<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.970> hot<00:02:59.330> how<00:02:59.900> the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and then go into the the hot how the

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.090 
and then go into the the hot how the
kids<00:03:00.260> think<00:03:00.560> about<00:03:00.650> what's<00:03:00.920> gonna<00:03:01.040> happen

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
kids think about what's gonna happen

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.160 
kids think about what's gonna happen
have<00:03:01.820> them<00:03:02.000> predict<00:03:02.480> have<00:03:02.810> them<00:03:02.989> make<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
have them predict have them make a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.140 
have them predict have them make a
hypothesis<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.100> test<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.519> if<00:03:04.790> they<00:03:04.940> mess<00:03:05.120> up

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
hypothesis and test it if they mess up

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.040 
hypothesis and test it if they mess up
so<00:03:05.570> what'd<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.750> dump<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:06.680> cool<00:03:06.890> I

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
so what'd you dump it out it's cool I

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.420 
so what'd you dump it out it's cool I
have<00:03:09.050> my<00:03:09.230> blue<00:03:09.500> now<00:03:09.890> I'm<00:03:09.950> gonna<00:03:10.130> go<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.310> little

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
have my blue now I'm gonna go a little

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.620 
have my blue now I'm gonna go a little
deeper<00:03:11.110> take<00:03:12.110> my<00:03:12.260> thumb<00:03:12.500> off<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:14.180> happened

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
deeper take my thumb off what happened

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.690 
deeper take my thumb off what happened
