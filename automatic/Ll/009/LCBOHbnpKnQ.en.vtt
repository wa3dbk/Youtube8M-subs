00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.420
 Hello everyone today after having redone 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.260
 see the assembling of the dead 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.090
 the star and how he turns to work 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.790
 I want to show you the last of the points 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.099
 crochet base that is the point 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.320
 shrimp the shrimp point is a lot 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.900
 important because it serves to refine everyone 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 the shrimp stitch works as the says 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 word itself is a point that goes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.650
 backwards so if for all points 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 crochet we go from the right 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.519
 to the left in the crayfish spot you will do 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.239
 the opposite is from left to 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.400
 right 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.239
 the point is very simple because in 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.670
 practice is a low point on the contrary yes 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.199
 our tip is therefore ours 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.019
 crochet in the next shirt had 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.400
 sorry back shirt collects the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:06.330
 thread as for the low point and it is done 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 pass through the two pasolini yes 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.700
 go back one of a point sifap 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 take the thread and pass it in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 this way 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 you see it's really simple simple 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.079
 but it is a fundamental point to be able to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.700
 as I told you before to refine yours 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:28.799
 jobs that will be more perfect and more 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.159
 pleasing to the eye then there are gods 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.979
 jobs that just require it then 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.149
 it is important to know how to do this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 point we have finished the explanation 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:47.939
 of all the crochet base points 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.579
 I hope as always to have been useful to you 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.299

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.299

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.469
 I hope I told you it was useful and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.969
