entertainment and considering that

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.900 
entertainment and considering that
sequels<00:00:35.710> are<00:00:35.860> usually<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.280> victims<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.820> the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
sequels are usually the victims of the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.940

law<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.270> diminishing<00:00:37.570> returns<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.590> wondered<00:00:38.920> to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
law of diminishing returns I wondered to

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.630 
law of diminishing returns I wondered to
myself<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:40.360> Pokemon<00:00:40.899> mm<00:00:41.680> actually<00:00:41.950> be<00:00:42.340> worse

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
myself can Pokemon mm actually be worse

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.779 
myself can Pokemon mm actually be worse
so<00:00:43.710> after<00:00:44.710> all<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.460> believe<00:00:45.489> that

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
so after all that can you believe that

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.760 
so after all that can you believe that
this<00:00:46.149> movie<00:00:46.570> isn't<00:00:47.260> horrible<00:00:48.359> yeah<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.590> not

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
this movie isn't horrible yeah it's not

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.529 
this movie isn't horrible yeah it's not
exactly<00:00:50.949> something<00:00:51.430> I'd<00:00:51.699> willingly<00:00:52.149> watch

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
exactly something I'd willingly watch

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.299 
exactly something I'd willingly watch
again<00:00:52.960> but<00:00:53.140> if<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.350> came<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.590> TV<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.129> would

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
again but if it came on TV I would

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.040 
again but if it came on TV I would
merely<00:00:54.640> change<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.210> channel<00:00:55.600> rather<00:00:55.840> than

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
merely change the channel rather than

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.990 
merely change the channel rather than
shrieking<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.739> terror<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.280> throwing<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.730> large

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
shrieking in terror and throwing a large

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.049

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
heavy object through the screen so at

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
heavy object through the screen so at
least<00:01:01.329> there's<00:01:01.600> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
least there's that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.520 
least there's that
Pokemon<00:01:03.100> mm<00:01:03.730> is<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.910> mess<00:01:04.449> just<00:01:04.809> like<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.290> first

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
entertaining than the original even

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.789 
entertaining than the original even
though<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:43.570> movie<00:01:44.020> doesn't<00:01:44.290> deal<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.740> a

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799

villain how to destroy the world the
stakes<00:01:46.990> do<00:01:47.350> seem<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.649> lot<00:01:47.890> higher<00:01:48.219> and<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
stakes do seem a lot higher and the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.700 
stakes do seem a lot higher and the
pacing<00:01:49.149> in<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.479> movie<00:01:49.719> is<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> lot<00:01:50.079> better<00:01:50.350> with

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
pacing in the movie is a lot better with

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.499 
pacing in the movie is a lot better with
its<00:01:50.860> starting<00:01:51.280> out<00:01:51.399> slower<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.060> then<00:01:52.180> gaining

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
its starting out slower and then gaining

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.230 
its starting out slower and then gaining
until<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> climax<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.579> any<00:01:54.790> simple

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
until a climax just like any simple

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.630 
until a climax just like any simple
