00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.000
 a picture that has become rare 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.710
 the herd of 500 sheep and goats 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.369
 becomes the SchÃ¤ferhof threatened in 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 sauerland maintenance the lord of the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.540
 sharp turn left since seven 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 Generations are based shepherd 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.860
 for Wendelin and his staff 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.950
 just one in the summer months 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.270
 a lot of work 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.430
 this is what the sheep are made of today 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.110
 Here we put on fresh feed 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.940
 have this course turf area for 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.440
 winter food mowed and the other 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
 surface is still to be seen and must 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.540
 to put up today and the sheep water 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.210
 give it to me let's say it 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.489
 Sun rises and now here's how to ok 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.780
 all right 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.090
 the staff are psychic or 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.370
 mentally handicapped and living ldl 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.379
 Wohnverbund marsberg for years 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.130
 Wendelin was there as a social worker 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.040
 worked 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.040
 shepherd that was next to job and families 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.079
 traction thank you ideas family threatened 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.600
 convinced mars berger clinic management 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.170
 from your yard a working support center 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 close 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.499
 cares for some years 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.869
 defensive left or now around the six 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.259
 disabled people as shepherds and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.909
 employees of the landscape association 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.639
 the advantage is that of course I mean 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.229
 social work in the context of a sheep farm 

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.880
 can do that is an absolute 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.939
 I live in luxury so that I live 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.869
 me too as a privilege but above that 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.939
 Of course, also the possibility 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.899
 that residents can work with us 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.979
 a holistic framework yes how to 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.029
 actually that way within one 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.859
 Not even in the form 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:49.409
 Inclusion within the facility 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.060
 I actually exclude 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.469
 the mentally and mentally disabled 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 People feel the drugs 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.929
 Taken respected your work counts 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.249
 they do something despite all the hurdles 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.909
 work also brings with it now 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:06.579
 sweat and sometimes effort is 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.830
 It's totally okay. I get it very much 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.310
 a lot is also essential in private 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.099
 balanced just great yellow 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.660
 hatched areas are already stripes 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.940
 for plants and animals 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.950
 two boys always free we arrive 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.230
 For a long time, there is the shepherd's court 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.480
 the lwl housing association provides power 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.510
 for the first time a work support center 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 the reason becomes a spatial 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.200
 separation between living and working 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.239
 created and for the residents more 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.909
 integration and normality 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.560
 the lwl finances this activity because 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.540
 has been established that the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.090
 Residents of this work are doing very well 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.170
 they are more independent they need 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.650
 less care 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 there is less to relapse and you 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.829
 are further negotiable 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.930
 They learn social skills from them 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.140
 can concentrate and it is 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.180
 a classic win win situation 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.860
 the employees benefit the shepherds 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.109
 family and the lwl 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.940
 He has the possibilities in the vicinity of 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.040
 marsberg agricultural work 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.390
 to offer without one operated 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.489
 own direction 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.680
 gas cartridge has the shepherd's farm at his 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.209
 son wendelin passed and is from 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.920
 whose concept convinces you are there 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.959
 Above all they are out in 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.769
 the nature and with us is every day 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.720
 somewhere else 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.720
 they already feel at home 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.599
 At noon, it is busy working hours 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.269
 are like those in the supervised 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.049
 workshops twice a quarter to three 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.049
 hour break 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.010
 you take the whole wheels out the top 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.230
 Check it out if they were already there 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.239
 then it has to continue in bird protection 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.260
 be pulled over the winter food 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.260
 everyone starts packing 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.870
 we have the luck that he had two 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.040
 People on the first job market 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.770
 could mediate 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.030
 And these are the little highlights 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.680
 if you look back then if the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.060
 four years that you have done that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.220
 they are not just working for something 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.910
 but also around the day 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.910
 to give meaning
