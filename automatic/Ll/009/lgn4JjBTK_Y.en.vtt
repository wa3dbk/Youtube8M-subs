a review for the following toys the
walking<00:00:05.520> dead<00:00:05.970> series<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.589> this<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
walking dead series to this is the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.230 
walking dead series to this is the
bicycle<00:00:08.550> girls<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.090> me<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:10.070> should<00:00:11.070> figure<00:00:11.280> so

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
bicycle girls on me I should figure so

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.710 
bicycle girls on me I should figure so
here<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:16.080> um<00:00:16.910> let's<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.449> over<00:00:18.630> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
here it is and um let's go over the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.750 
here it is and um let's go over the
accessories<00:00:19.260> first<00:00:19.529> she<00:00:19.740> comes<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.460> them

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
accessories first she comes with them

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
accessories first she comes with them
don't<00:00:21.750> know<00:00:21.840> why<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:21.990> she<00:00:22.170> comes<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.710> these

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
don't know why but she comes with these

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.790 
don't know why but she comes with these
set<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> genes<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:25.080> kind<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.470> go

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
set of genes which can kind of just go

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
set of genes which can kind of just go
on<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:30.800> ultimately<00:00:32.660> failing<00:00:33.660> there

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on or like ultimately failing there

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.510 
on or like ultimately failing there
there<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> yeah<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.280> crap

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
there we go but yeah I think it's crap

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040 
there we go but yeah I think it's crap
because<00:00:38.760> she<00:00:38.969> doesn't<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.450> come<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because she doesn't really come with a

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
because she doesn't really come with a
set<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> genes<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> they're<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.520> really

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
set of genes and they're like really

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.930 
set of genes and they're like really
weird<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.210> yeah<00:00:42.540> she<00:00:42.600> comes<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.139 

you<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.739> comes<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.149> think<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
you just comes with think this is a

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.510 
you just comes with think this is a
looks<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.660> phone<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.649> mom<00:00:55.860> used<00:00:56.160> tab<00:00:56.370> looks

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
looks like a phone my mom used tab looks

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.869 
looks like a phone my mom used tab looks
like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> blackberry<00:00:58.399> don't<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.670> well

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
like a blackberry don't know how well

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.439 
like a blackberry don't know how well
you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.410> cracked<00:01:02.449> but

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you can see that but it's cracked but

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
you can see that but it's cracked but
yeah<00:01:03.899> those<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> accessories<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
yeah those are all the accessories I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
yeah those are all the accessories I
don't<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> set<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> genes<00:01:06.479> but

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
don't really get a set of genes but

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
don't really get a set of genes but
whatever<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.970> she<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.060> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> make<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
whatever I know she can kind of make it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.490 
whatever I know she can kind of make it
look<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.840> she's<00:01:10.080> crawling<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.470> a

little button right there his look at

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.999 
little button right there his look at
the<00:01:21.720> figure<00:01:22.170> looks<00:01:22.770> pretty<00:01:23.670> nice<00:01:24.000> actually

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
the figure looks pretty nice actually

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
the figure looks pretty nice actually
like<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.250> sculpt<00:01:26.790> um<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
like that sculpt um it does have a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
like that sculpt um it does have a
limited<00:01:28.590> articulation<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.729> alright

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
limited articulation but that's alright

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.710 
limited articulation but that's alright
Plus<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.689> she<00:01:31.500> comes<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.070> face<00:01:32.909> thingy<00:01:33.420> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
thank you / articulation on this but uh

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.390 
thank you / articulation on this but uh
okay<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.439> to<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.590> pretty<00:02:14.739> tough<00:02:15.129> but

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
okay it's going to be pretty tough but

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.059 
okay it's going to be pretty tough but
uh<00:02:15.430> our<00:02:16.360> arm<00:02:16.689> can't<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.349> move<00:02:17.530> but<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.890> can

uh our arm can't really move but it can

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.979 
uh our arm can't really move but it can
bend<00:02:18.370> at<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.549> elbow<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.360> swivel<00:02:19.750> at

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
bend at the elbow and it can swivel at

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.929 
bend at the elbow and it can swivel at
the<00:02:20.140> wrist<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.530> our<00:02:20.680> head<00:02:20.980> can<00:02:21.280> move<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.819> little

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939
