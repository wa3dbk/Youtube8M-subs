00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hey guys this is a Qi energy demolition

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.339 
hey guys this is a Qi energy demolition
test<00:00:08.719> to<00:00:09.719> see<00:00:09.929> if<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.969> demolish<00:00:12.349> this

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
test to see if I can demolish this

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.599 
test to see if I can demolish this
structure<00:00:14.099> made<00:00:15.410> with<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:17.330> Qi<00:00:18.330> energy<00:00:18.630> blast

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
structure made with my Qi energy blast

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.560 
structure made with my Qi energy blast
this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:21.000> time<00:00:21.210> I've<00:00:21.330> attempted

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
this is the first time I've attempted

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 
this is the first time I've attempted
this

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
this
I<00:00:24.439> haven't<00:00:25.439> attempted<00:00:25.680> off-camera<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.240> just

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I haven't attempted off-camera so I just

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.439 
I haven't attempted off-camera so I just
built<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.900> structure<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.240> tested<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
built this structure and tested for the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.260 
built this structure and tested for the
first<00:00:30.480> time<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:31.590> TNG<00:00:32.300> we've<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.450> two

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
first time in my TNG we've got two

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.130 
first time in my TNG we've got two
Emmentaler<00:00:36.270> walls<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.809> bottom<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:39.140> large

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Emmentaler walls of the bottom a large

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.729 
Emmentaler walls of the bottom a large
poster<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> block<00:00:41.629> two<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.870> rows

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
poster in block two more rows

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.420 
poster in block two more rows
another<00:00:44.640> polystyrene<00:00:45.390> block<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.160> two<00:00:47.160> more

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
another polystyrene block and two more

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.400 
another polystyrene block and two more
tours<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> top<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> quite<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:54.410> strong

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
tours at the top so it's quite a strong

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.950 
tours at the top so it's quite a strong
structure<00:00:55.940> for<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> strong<00:00:57.270> foundation<00:00:59.870> can<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
structure for a strong foundation can I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.890 
structure for a strong foundation can I
see<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:04.729> I'm<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.850> expecting<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
see how I do I'm not expecting to get in

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.539 
see how I do I'm not expecting to get in
the<00:01:06.990> first<00:01:07.200> strike<00:01:07.700> might<00:01:08.700> take<00:01:08.939> me<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> few

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
the first strike might take me a few

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.230 
the first strike might take me a few
energy<00:01:11.549> strikes<00:01:11.880> before<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.600> demolish<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.120 

but<00:01:18.240> anyway<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:18.840> aim<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.439> foundation

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
but anyway I'm gonna aim the foundation

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.710 
but anyway I'm gonna aim the foundation
to<00:01:20.970> take<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> whole<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.659> down

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.590 

as<00:01:29.110> you<00:01:29.470> can<00:01:29.620> see<00:01:29.770> it's<00:01:30.640> barely<00:01:30.910> moving<00:01:31.270> which

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
as you can see it's barely moving which

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
as you can see it's barely moving which
shows<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.930> quite<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> strong

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
shows that it is a quite a strong

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:52.160 
shows that it is a quite a strong
structure

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.600 

okay<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.680> changed<00:01:55.680> my<00:01:55.800> strategy

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
okay I changed my strategy

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.360 
okay I changed my strategy
the<00:01:57.420> foundation<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.050> too<00:01:58.229> strong<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.860> I'm

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
the foundation is too strong so I'm

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.750 
the foundation is too strong so I'm
going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.470> second<00:02:01.470> level<00:02:01.650> see<00:02:02.640> if

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
going to go for the second level see if

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:19.320 
going to go for the second level see if
I<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:03.300> down<00:02:03.450> from<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.100 

it's<00:02:19.870> Rocking

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.330 

okay<00:02:27.860> second<00:02:28.550> level<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:30.050> also<00:02:30.470> too<00:02:30.740> strong<00:02:31.070> so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
okay second level is also too strong so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.340 
okay second level is also too strong so
I<00:02:32.320> take<00:02:33.320> over<00:02:33.500> top<00:02:33.800> level<00:02:34.130> first<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.350> then

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
I take over top level first and then

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100 
I take over top level first and then
work<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:36.620> way<00:02:36.860> down<00:02:37.810> until<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.930> whole<00:02:39.080> thing

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
work my way down until the whole thing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:03:00.649 
work my way down until the whole thing
is<00:02:39.350> flat

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.740
