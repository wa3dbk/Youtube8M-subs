standing over this game so um let's talk

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.810 
standing over this game so um let's talk
about<00:00:47.010> drifting<00:00:48.559> drifting<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:50.129> super

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
about drifting drifting it's super

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
about drifting drifting it's super
important<00:00:51.360> whenever<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.930> can't<00:00:52.710> come<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
important whenever you can't come up to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.090 
important whenever you can't come up to
a<00:00:53.280> turn<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.390> always<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> drift<00:00:55.680> it's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a turn you always want to drift it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
a turn you always want to drift it's
tight<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.610> look<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.510> subtle<00:00:57.809> turn

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
tight I'm look like really subtle turn

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
tight I'm look like really subtle turn
you're<00:00:58.260> gonna<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.390> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you're gonna want to do it and the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
you're gonna want to do it and the
tighter<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.379> turn<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:03.260> longer<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.710> want<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
tighter the turn the longer you want to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.490 
tighter the turn the longer you want to
hold<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.970> breaks<00:01:06.270> button<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> earlier

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
hold the breaks button and the earlier

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
hold the breaks button and the earlier
you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> hold<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> brake<00:01:08.369> button<00:01:08.610> before

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you want to hold the brake button before

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.500 
you want to hold the brake button before
the<00:01:09.270> turn<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.280> see<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.180> obviously

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the turn and see like here I obviously

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.149 
the turn and see like here I obviously
did<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> pretty<00:01:13.140> well<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.799> didn't<00:01:14.100> even

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
did it pretty well and then didn't even

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.969 
did it pretty well and then didn't even
crash<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> wall<00:01:15.210> yeah<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> um<00:01:18.979> that's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
crash into the wall yeah so um that's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
crash into the wall yeah so um that's
very<00:01:20.250> important<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> subtle<00:01:22.200> turn

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
very important and if it's a subtle turn

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.120 
very important and if it's a subtle turn
you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.720> tap<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.290> brake<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you can just tap the brake or you can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
you can just tap the brake or you can
release<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.729> gas<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.299> they'll<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
release the gas and they'll put you in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.520 
release the gas and they'll put you in
the<00:01:28.259> drift<00:01:28.500> mode<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.259> pretty

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the drift mode so that's pretty

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
the drift mode so that's pretty
important<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:33.890> think<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.009> smarter<00:01:35.610> about

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
important and I think I'm smarter about

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
important and I think I'm smarter about
nitrous<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.720> oh<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> uh<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:38.310> once<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.180> turn

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
nitrous now oh and uh what once you turn

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
nitrous now oh and uh what once you turn
and<00:01:40.409> you're<00:01:40.890> drifting<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and you're drifting and you get out of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.649 
and you're drifting and you get out of
trip<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:44.100> turning<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.240> should<00:01:45.479> use

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
trip and you're turning you should use

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
trip and you're turning you should use
the<00:01:45.810> nitrous<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> either<00:01:46.710> stabilize<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.909> just

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the nitrous to either stabilize or just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.990 
the nitrous to either stabilize or just
to<00:01:48.270> gain<00:01:48.509> speed<00:01:48.979> because<00:01:49.979> once<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.820> those

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to gain speed because once you do those

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.080 
to gain speed because once you do those
two<00:01:51.270> things<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.560> helps<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.520> get

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
two things it really helps you just get

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.290 
two things it really helps you just get
back<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> game

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
back in the game

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.620 
back in the game
and<00:01:56.720> just<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.290> game<00:01:57.890> from<00:01:58.070> speed<00:01:58.430> or<00:01:58.820> just<00:01:59.390> keep

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and just a game from speed or just keep

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.190 
and just a game from speed or just keep
your<00:01:59.870> lead<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:00.530> you're<00:02:00.710> winning<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:02.200> talking

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
your lead if you're winning and talking

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.470 
your lead if you're winning and talking
about<00:02:03.440> nitrous<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.160> think<00:02:04.370> I<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.820> mention

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
about nitrous I think I want to mention

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.810 
about nitrous I think I want to mention
the<00:02:05.810> four<00:02:06.290> ways<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.920> gain<00:02:07.190> interest<00:02:07.610> a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
the four ways you can gain interest a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.730 
the four ways you can gain interest a
lot<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.119> people<00:02:08.390> don't<00:02:08.510> know<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.710> can

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
lot of people don't know this you can

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.870 
lot of people don't know this you can
gain<00:02:10.190> nitrous<00:02:10.790> faster<00:02:11.540> when<00:02:12.500> you're<00:02:12.980> riding

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
gain nitrous faster when you're riding

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.020 
gain nitrous faster when you're riding
in<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.560> opposite<00:02:15.560> lane<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:18.040> go<00:02:19.040> near<00:02:19.730> by

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
in the opposite lane you go near by

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.190 
in the opposite lane you go near by
oncoming<00:02:20.540> cars<00:02:21.760> you're<00:02:22.870> slipstreaming<00:02:23.870> which

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
oncoming cars you're slipstreaming which

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.660 
oncoming cars you're slipstreaming which
is<00:02:24.350> basically<00:02:24.740> you're<00:02:25.070> just<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.460> really

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
is basically you're just like really

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.340 
is basically you're just like really
close<00:02:26.630> behind<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.500> another<00:02:28.490> racer<00:02:29.000> or<00:02:29.840> you're
