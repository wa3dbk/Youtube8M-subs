00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Press thumb dive that one can 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.790
 also quite classic, namely in the water 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 and he does it again today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.300
 Cameraman holly barons through the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.679
 Diving goggles look for appointment 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.679
 the work too exciting 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.400
 Divers are looking with their so close-up 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 appliances sheep fighting materials bad 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.840
 view the tension of a cold 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 war effort in the serious case they must 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.439
 in such situations the nerves 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 to keep 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 before the miners dive under their work 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.600
 water can run through it 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 an elaborate education and the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.340
 starts here in eckernfÃ¶rde in the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.860
 Diver exercise hall once deep air 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 get from the jump that should be enough for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.829
 a complicated tasked combat suit 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 put underwater and all sorry 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.170
 actually dive out 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 Miner divers II with breath held 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 They used compressed air bottles that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 these candidates anyway, all without 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 Breathing apparatus has a simple power 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.520
 basic psychology examine the instructors 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.820
 like the men in this artificial 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 respond to the stress situation 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.610
 because when you mine in the war effort 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 have to make harmless 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 it depends on nerve strength against the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.880
 fight breathless charming he opens 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.530
 highly concentrated buttons zippers 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.049
 and then cords his suit ready 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.670
 even to the leader with the lead 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.680
 weight on the shoulders he can 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.680
 walk upright on the floor 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 the divers have everything in their hands 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.430
 view 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.380
 Immediately he can breathe deeply again 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.420
 his mate is already preparing the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.370
 so-called underwater march before 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.200
 training says finish then 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.510
 So I try to keep my breathing under 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.560
 control to stop now says 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.710
 slowly then I pull as much air as 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.590
 possible an approximate better 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.230
 says and from time to time again 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.990
 really clean in as much as money thank you 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.490
 I baseless and makes the upper body 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.490
 easy forward that I so little 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.640
 Resistance as possible to the sloping 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.190
 front is quite okay is the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.390
 speed is pretty big and 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.330
 then afterwards when you stop 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.610
 horizontal and is therefore still one 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.790
 piece forward and then with your feet 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.320
 I also take care that I have so much 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.660
 friction has as possible so first 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.959
 occur properly on the ground and then 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.720
 move forward from the first coo 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.300
 then then I get light art 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.830
 already then it is clear then I try 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.930
 a bit more pressure will be 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.290
 faster but not so fast 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.200
 so that not too much oxygen burned 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 and then when they produced at corner 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.350
 have a little more now 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 Of course, I try to calmly 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.130
 stay and continue to grow and if I am 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.040
 arrives at income we may hands 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.959
 to take help and for that I am glad 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.600
 both sides were on the poor 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.150
 and on the two open crown and then 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.220
 I am happy when I Top 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.900
 has achieved 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.270
 this was only a small part of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.770
 All participants have training today 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.690
 Her tasks were mastered super 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.710
 I now need it for now, and 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.240
 next but also bye tobias
