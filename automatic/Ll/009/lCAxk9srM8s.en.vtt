00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.290 

yeah<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> got<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> dead<00:00:01.979> side<00:00:02.429> marker<00:00:02.879> light<00:00:03.090> and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
yeah I got a dead side marker light and

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.860 
yeah I got a dead side marker light and
you<00:00:03.990> know<00:00:04.110> got<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.680> lights<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.879> actually

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
you know got the lights on so I actually

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.720 
you know got the lights on so I actually
got<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.230> change<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.589> some<00:00:07.980> red<00:00:08.160> bulbs<00:00:08.580> he's

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
got to change you some red bulbs he's

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.120 
got to change you some red bulbs he's
these<00:00:09.450> lenses<00:00:09.900> got<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.260> faded<00:00:10.530> out<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.860> got<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
these lenses got so faded out I got a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.890 
these lenses got so faded out I got a
change<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> rental<00:00:11.940> find<00:00:12.150> his<00:00:12.330> rent

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
change in the rental find his rent

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
change in the rental find his rent
red<00:00:13.320> colored<00:00:14.750> tail<00:00:15.750> light<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.170> they'll<00:00:16.440> show

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
red colored tail light so they'll show

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.609 
red colored tail light so they'll show
up<00:00:17.039> red<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.910> side<00:00:18.150> marker<00:00:18.539> light<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> out

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
up red but this side marker light is out

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.540 
up red but this side marker light is out
so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.430> suspect<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:22.560> his<00:00:22.740> splice<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.340> made

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
so I suspect that it's his splice I made

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.509 
so I suspect that it's his splice I made
here<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> while<00:00:24.029> back<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.519> long

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
here a while back you can see that long

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
here a while back you can see that long
time<00:00:26.820> ago<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:29.090> just<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> verify<00:00:30.529> if<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.679> got

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
time ago and just to verify if we got

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.950 
time ago and just to verify if we got
voltage<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:35.360> just<00:00:36.360> turn<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
voltage to it just turn it on the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.360 
voltage to it just turn it on the
voltmeter<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:40.280> just<00:00:41.280> plug<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.730> here

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
voltmeter here and just plug it in here

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.479 
voltmeter here and just plug it in here
on<00:00:44.370> each<00:00:44.640> side<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.090> notice<00:00:49.160> get<00:00:50.160> really

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
on each side and you notice get really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
on each side and you notice get really
low<00:00:50.670> volts<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.680> see<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.840> really<00:00:54.840> low

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
low volts right see that really low

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.549 
low volts right see that really low
pulse<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:56.899> now<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.280> um<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.809> could

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pulse right now the thing is um I could

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
pulse right now the thing is um I could
check<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:01.859> um<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.480> ohms<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.790> what<00:01:05.970> kind

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
check for um the ohms and see what kind

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
check for um the ohms and see what kind
of<00:01:06.270> ground<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.979> grounded<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.520> out

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
of ground we got and I grounded this out

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.460 
of ground we got and I grounded this out
actually<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> rusty<00:01:09.720> connection<00:01:10.260> but

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
actually to a rusty connection but

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.530 
actually to a rusty connection but
should<00:01:11.280> still<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.939> close<00:01:12.950> not<00:01:13.950> too<00:01:14.130> bad

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.750 

Cedar's<00:01:18.540> uh<00:01:19.400> conductivity<00:01:20.400> nears

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
Cedar's uh conductivity nears

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.490 
Cedar's uh conductivity nears
connectivity<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.080> even<00:01:22.410> though

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
connectivity there right even though

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.290 
connectivity there right even though
that's<00:01:22.620> on<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> rusty<00:01:23.070> connection<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> got<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
that's on a rusty connection so I got a

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.990 
that's on a rusty connection so I got a
pretty<00:01:24.480> good<00:01:24.630> ground<00:01:25.050> I'm<00:01:25.260> not<00:01:25.380> getting<00:01:25.620> volts

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
pretty good ground I'm not getting volts

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
pretty good ground I'm not getting volts
and<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.980> could

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and it looks like you know so I could

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.380 
and it looks like you know so I could
check<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:30.120> this<00:01:30.360> side<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> wire<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:32.390> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
check is this side of the wire here you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
check is this side of the wire here you
know<00:01:33.510> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.870> inside<00:01:34.260> of<00:01:34.410> this<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
know on the inside of this where the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.000 
know on the inside of this where the
splices<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:37.710> course

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
splices it's probably that and of course

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.469 
splices it's probably that and of course
you<00:01:38.250> might<00:01:38.430> want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> check<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> bulb<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you might want to check the bulb to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
you might want to check the bulb to
itself<00:01:39.900> I'll<00:01:40.200> show<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.410> how<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> check<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
itself I'll show you how to check the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.530 
itself I'll show you how to check the
bulb<00:01:41.160> pick<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.090> bulb<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.870> just<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
bulb pick the bulb is you just take the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.900 
bulb pick the bulb is you just take the
prong<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.320> side<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.830> touch<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
prong on this side and touch it to the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.150 
prong on this side and touch it to the
other<00:01:48.210> side<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> contact<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> can

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
other side of the contact and you can

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.640 
other side of the contact and you can
see<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.210> ohms<00:01:51.330> went<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:51.930> zero<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.290> good

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
see the ohms went to zero so that's good

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.010 
see the ohms went to zero so that's good
the<00:01:55.890> bulbs<00:01:56.190> good<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.270> actually<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the bulbs good so actually I'm going to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.550 
the bulbs good so actually I'm going to
check<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.650> if<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.759> got<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.940> pulse<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
check to see if it's got a pulse at the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.460 
check to see if it's got a pulse at the
other<00:02:01.680> side<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.220> wire<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.670> before

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
other side of the wire that's before

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.859 
other side of the wire that's before
this<00:02:04.470> side<00:02:04.830> on<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:06.119> side<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.660> wire<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this side on that side of the wire I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.639 
this side on that side of the wire I
like<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.440> do<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.100> like<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:09.179> press<00:02:09.649> these

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
like to do is I like to not press these

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.510 
like to do is I like to not press these
big<00:02:12.050> points<00:02:13.050> into<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> wire<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.950> like<00:02:14.280> using

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
big points into the wire I like using

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.160 
big points into the wire I like using
using<00:02:15.510> these<00:02:15.630> little<00:02:17.090> pins<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
using these little pins like that so you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.570 
using these little pins like that so you
don't<00:02:19.320> put<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> big<00:02:19.530> hole<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> wire<00:02:20.250> that's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
don't put a big hole in the wire that's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.430 
don't put a big hole in the wire that's
something<00:02:20.880> else<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.870> actually<00:02:21.989> sticks

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
something else I do it actually sticks

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.229 
something else I do it actually sticks
into<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> wire<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> lot<00:02:23.190> better<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
into the wire a lot better and it

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.410 
into the wire a lot better and it
doesn't<00:02:24.540> damage<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> wire<00:02:25.140> much<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.209> see

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
doesn't damage the wire much and you see

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.170 
doesn't damage the wire much and you see
I<00:02:27.450> put<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.900> pin<00:02:28.670> stuck<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> wire

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I put a little pin stuck it in the wire

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
I put a little pin stuck it in the wire
before<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.260> break<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:33.269> got<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.900> it's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
before this break and I got a like it's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900 
before this break and I got a like it's
not<00:02:34.350> on<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> really<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.070> good<00:02:35.370> ground<00:02:35.670> it's

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
not on a really really good ground it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.430 
not on a really really good ground it's
kind<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.330> rusty<00:02:36.660> ground<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.170> can<00:02:37.260> see<00:02:37.380> I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
kind of a rusty ground but you can see I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.030 
kind of a rusty ground but you can see I
got<00:02:37.590> 11<00:02:37.920> volts<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:39.500> that's<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.680> problem

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
got 11 volts there so that's the problem

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.780 
got 11 volts there so that's the problem
it's<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:42.140> joint<00:02:43.140> right<00:02:43.320> here<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.860> I'll<00:02:44.100> cut

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's this joint right here so I'll cut

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.100 
it's this joint right here so I'll cut
it<00:02:44.910> solder<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.510> up<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:46.410> should<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.709> all<00:02:46.830> set
