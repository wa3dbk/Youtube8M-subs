00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.570 

right<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:07.080> use<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.529> test<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.250> for

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
right so how do you use the test for for

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.370 
right so how do you use the test for for
this<00:00:09.410> scoreboard<00:00:10.969> it's<00:00:12.139> exactly<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> same

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this scoreboard it's exactly the same

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.709 
this scoreboard it's exactly the same
come<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.860> always<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.309> test<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:15.509> what

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
come on is always the test for but what

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.599 
come on is always the test for but what
is<00:00:15.839> new<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.680> need<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.130> score

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
is new is that you need to have score

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.210 
is new is that you need to have score
and<00:00:17.880> then<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.840> need<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> objective

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and then you need to have the objective

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.660 
and then you need to have the objective
that<00:00:20.660> okay<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.109> need<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.920> value

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
that okay and they need to have a value

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.950 
that okay and they need to have a value
for<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.300> objective

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
for that objective

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.349 
for that objective
so<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.500> case<00:00:25.710> score<00:00:26.310> underscore<00:00:26.760> dummy

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so in this case score underscore dummy

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.320 
so in this case score underscore dummy
equals<00:00:28.019> 10<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.400> means<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
equals 10 so what this means is that and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.030 
equals 10 so what this means is that and
I<00:00:31.189> if<00:00:32.189> I've<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> score<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> 10<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.559> will

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I if I've got a score up to 10 it will

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
I if I've got a score up to 10 it will
activate<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.030> where<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.660> 0<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> 10<00:00:37.879> minus<00:00:38.879> 1

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
activate so where it's 0 to 10 minus 1

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.810 
activate so where it's 0 to 10 minus 1
million<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.260> 10<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.920> long<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.430> under

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
million to 10 so as long as it's under

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.560 
million to 10 so as long as it's under
10<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:43.200> activate<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.250> moment<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:45.120> over

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
10 it will activate the moment I go over

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
10 it will activate the moment I go over
10<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.320> example<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> moment<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.190> hit<00:00:48.890> 20

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
10 so for example the moment I hit 20

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.930 
10 so for example the moment I hit 20
you<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.300> turns<00:00:51.660> off<00:00:52.219> okay<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
you will see it turns off okay the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.389 
you will see it turns off okay the
moment<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.360> under<00:00:54.600> 20<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> turns<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.590> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
moment I go under 20 it turns off but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.439 
moment I go under 20 it turns off but
what<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.820> noticed<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
what you would have noticed is I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.799 
what you would have noticed is I
actually<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.620> another<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.340> running

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
actually now have another one running

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
actually now have another one running
score<00:01:00.809> underscore<00:01:01.140> dummy<00:01:01.620> underscore

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
score underscore dummy underscore

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
score underscore dummy underscore
minimum<00:01:03.000> equals<00:01:03.510> 10<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> need<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
minimum equals 10 so I need to have a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.179 
minimum equals 10 so I need to have a
minimum<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> 10<00:01:06.450> levels<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.500> you'll<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
minimum of 10 levels so you'll see this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.820 
minimum of 10 levels so you'll see this
light<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.580> turned<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.140> clear<00:01:10.619> my

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
light is turned on so if I clear my

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.140 
light is turned on so if I clear my
school<00:01:12.140> right<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.619> light<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.850> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
school right that light will go off if I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
school right that light will go off if I
give<00:01:15.360> myself<00:01:15.509> 10<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.860> light<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
give myself 10 the light will go on

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
give myself 10 the light will go on
because<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> am<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.119> 10<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.170> remove<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
because I am now 10 but if I remove a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
because I am now 10 but if I remove a
point<00:01:20.040> you'll<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> light<00:01:21.479> will

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
point you'll see that the light will

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
point you'll see that the light will
actually<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.549> am<00:01:23.670> NOT<00:01:23.939> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
actually go off because I am NOT on

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
actually go off because I am NOT on
level<00:01:24.509> 10<00:01:24.750> okay<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.310> has<00:01:26.430> gone<00:01:26.580> on

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
level 10 okay so this one has gone on

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
level 10 okay so this one has gone on
because<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> am<00:01:27.540> NOT<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:28.080> lid<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:28.890> because

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because I am NOT at lid on off because

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.609 
because I am NOT at lid on off because
I'm<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.820> level<00:01:30.090> 10<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.990> has<00:01:31.170> gone<00:01:31.380> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
I'm not on level 10 this one has gone on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'm not on level 10 this one has gone on
because<00:01:32.070> I've<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.610> yet<00:01:33.000> reached<00:01:33.479> level<00:01:33.869> 10

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
because I've not yet reached level 10

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
because I've not yet reached level 10
then<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.400> where<00:01:35.579> I

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
then I have the other one where I

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.450 
then I have the other one where I
actually<00:01:35.820> use<00:01:36.150> both<00:01:36.659> commands<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.100> you'll<00:01:38.250> see

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
actually use both commands so you'll see

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
actually use both commands so you'll see
what<00:01:38.670> I've<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.299> score<00:01:39.689> underscore

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
what I've got here is score underscore

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
what I've got here is score underscore
dummy<00:01:40.740> equals<00:01:41.130> 9<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> score

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
dummy equals 9 so I need to have a score

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.580 
dummy equals 9 so I need to have a score
up<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> 9<00:01:44.509> okay<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
up to 9 okay and then I have to have and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.230 
up to 9 okay and then I have to have and
then<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> next<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.280> says<00:01:47.430> score<00:01:47.909> underscore

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
then the next one says score underscore

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840 
then the next one says score underscore
dummy<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.439> score<00:01:49.710> minimum<00:01:50.130> needs<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.759> be

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
dummy and the score minimum needs to be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600 
dummy and the score minimum needs to be
9<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> test<00:01:53.310> for

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
9 that so this is if I want to test for

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.410 
9 that so this is if I want to test for
exactly<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.869> 9<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.710> want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> say<00:01:56.070> if

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
exactly for 9 so if I want to say if

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
exactly for 9 so if I want to say if
example<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> make<00:01:58.020> sure<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.710> when

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
example I want to make sure that when

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
example I want to make sure that when
somebody<00:01:59.579> actually<00:01:59.790> gets<00:02:00.570> 9<00:02:01.049> kills<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.799> want<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
somebody actually gets 9 kills I want to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 
somebody actually gets 9 kills I want to
do<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.430> action<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.509> how<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.689> would<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
do an action this is how we would do it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.740 
do an action this is how we would do it
squaw<00:02:04.799> underscore<00:02:05.130> dummy<00:02:05.340> equals<00:02:05.729> 9<00:02:05.939> score

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
squaw underscore dummy equals 9 score

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.270 
squaw underscore dummy equals 9 score
underscore<00:02:06.990> dummy<00:02:07.380> underscore<00:02:07.920> minimum

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
underscore dummy underscore minimum

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.170 
underscore dummy underscore minimum
equals<00:02:08.729> 9<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> exactly<00:02:10.170> 9<00:02:10.489> so<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.000> go

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
equals 9 so this is exactly 9 so if I go

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.120 
equals 9 so this is exactly 9 so if I go
back<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
back here

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.300 
back here
I<00:02:13.190> add<00:02:13.700> 10<00:02:14.950> okay<00:02:16.900> both<00:02:17.900> will<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I add 10 okay both will be on and if I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.470 
I add 10 okay both will be on and if I
take<00:02:20.000> one<00:02:20.240> away<00:02:21.520> only<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.060> will<00:02:23.240> be<00:02:23.360> on

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
take one away only the one will be on

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.440 
take one away only the one will be on
right<00:02:24.230> now<00:02:24.470> you're<00:02:24.710> not<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.180> limited<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
right now you're not just limited to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.890 
right now you're not just limited to
actually<00:02:26.930> using<00:02:27.730> those<00:02:28.730> variables<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.750> can

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
actually using those variables you can

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.930 
actually using those variables you can
for<00:02:30.110> example<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:30.680> over<00:02:30.890> here<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:31.400> actually

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
for example see over here I'm actually

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.000 
for example see over here I'm actually
using<00:02:32.210> coordinates<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.500> you'll<00:02:33.650> see<00:02:33.860> over

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
using coordinates so you'll see over

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.620 
using coordinates so you'll see over
there<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.600> over<00:02:35.600> here<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.410> have<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.800> blue<00:02:37.280> block

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
there and over here I have a blue block

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.530 
there and over here I have a blue block
so<00:02:38.630> what<00:02:38.900> I've<00:02:38.990> set<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.740> if<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.430> am<00:02:41.240> in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
so what I've set up is that if I am in

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.470 
so what I've set up is that if I am in
one<00:02:42.410> radius<00:02:42.890> from<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.310> blue<00:02:43.520> block<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.090> my

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
one radius from that blue block and my

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.510 
one radius from that blue block and my
score<00:02:45.190> food<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.550> dummy<00:02:46.820> is<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> minimum<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.870> ten

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
score food for dummy is a minimum of ten

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.040 
score food for dummy is a minimum of ten
okay<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.700> need<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.030> go<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.270> get<00:02:50.390> myself<00:02:50.690> some

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
okay so I need to go and get myself some

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.310 
okay so I need to go and get myself some
more<00:02:51.200> points<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.660> am<00:02:53.960> in<00:02:56.320> adventure

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
mode the light will go on so if I if I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.620 
mode the light will go on so if I if I
now<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.530> turn<00:03:00.740> on<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.070> clock<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:02.330> turn<00:03:02.540> on

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the clock if I now stand on this you'll

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.300 
the clock if I now stand on this you'll
see<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.840> light<00:03:05.990> won't<00:03:06.260> go<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:07.280> for

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
see the light won't go on because for

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.980 
see the light won't go on because for

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
one I'm not in adventure mode and for

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.210

you'll now see that the light still

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.090 
you'll now see that the light still
doesn't<00:03:20.360> go<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.660> because<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.320> need<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.890> in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
doesn't go on because I need to be in

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.480 
doesn't go on because I need to be in
game<00:03:22.580> mode<00:03:23.120> -<00:03:24.280> okay

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
game mode - okay

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.210 
game mode - okay
the<00:03:25.940> moment<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.510> walk<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.930> there<00:03:27.290> we<00:03:27.410> go<00:03:27.590> see

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
the moment and I walk on there we go see

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.550 
the moment and I walk on there we go see
right<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.490> this<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:32.000> using<00:03:32.560> coordinates

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
right so this is now using coordinates

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.600 
right so this is now using coordinates
plus<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.400> dummy<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.600> school<00:03:35.960> plus<00:03:36.610> my
