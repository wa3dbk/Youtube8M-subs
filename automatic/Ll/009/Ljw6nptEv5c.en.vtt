00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
this is this is a great result of course

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.549 
this is this is a great result of course
for<00:01:01.440> somebody<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.160> young<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.149> rule<00:01:03.480> still<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
for somebody as young as rule still is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.429 
for somebody as young as rule still is
so<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.909> doesn't<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.659> champion<00:01:07.260> this

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so if it doesn't get will champion this

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.969 
so if it doesn't get will champion this
timing<00:01:08.189> he<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.909> enough<00:01:09.299> chances

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
timing he will get enough chances

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.609 
timing he will get enough chances
why<00:01:12.700> was<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.119> move<00:01:13.330> in<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.689> position<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
why was to move in this position and the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.179 
why was to move in this position and the
bullet<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.189> best<00:01:15.400> move<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.180> play

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
bullet and the best move is to play

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.030 
bullet and the best move is to play
39:34<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.640> this<00:01:19.000> looks<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.110> very<00:01:20.470> awkward

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
39:34 and this looks like a very awkward

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.429 
39:34 and this looks like a very awkward
position<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:22.299> white<00:01:22.509> because<00:01:23.020> since<00:01:23.259> the

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
position for white because since the

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.840 
position for white because since the
beginning<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.310> game<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:25.030> left<00:01:25.390> wing<00:01:25.930> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
beginning of the game the left wing of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
beginning of the game the left wing of
Joe<00:01:27.880> Arthur<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.830> loaded<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:30.039> pieces<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Joe Arthur is loaded with pieces and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840 
Joe Arthur is loaded with pieces and
doesn't<00:01:33.850> look<00:01:34.030> too<00:01:34.299> nice<00:01:34.630> but<00:01:35.409> sometimes<00:01:36.369> this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
doesn't look too nice but sometimes this

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.190 
doesn't look too nice but sometimes this
can<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.710> played<00:01:39.539> but<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.689> position<00:01:41.110> is

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
can can be played but the position is

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
can can be played but the position is
also<00:01:41.610> split<00:01:42.610> cos<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:44.409> both<00:01:45.069> wings<00:01:45.399> White<00:01:45.640> has<00:01:45.880> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
also split cos at both wings White has a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.930 
also split cos at both wings White has a
construction<00:01:46.960> but<00:01:47.229> in<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.800> center<00:01:48.069> is<00:01:48.280> empty

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
construction but in the center is empty

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
construction but in the center is empty
so<00:01:49.390> black<00:01:50.170> try<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.940> take<00:01:51.940> advantage<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.780> that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
so black try to take advantage of that

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.609 
so black try to take advantage of that
and<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.380> game<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:55.299> succeeded<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:56.229> this

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
and in the game this succeeded but this

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.039 
and in the game this succeeded but this
is<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.830> better<00:01:57.310> move<00:01:57.670> if<00:01:58.000> black<00:01:58.450> plays<00:01:58.750> like

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
is a better move if black plays like

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.340 
is a better move if black plays like
this<00:01:59.409> white<00:01:59.950> goes<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:01.209> this<00:02:01.539> and<00:02:01.929> making<00:02:02.140> a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
this white goes like this and making a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:11.910 
this white goes like this and making a
strange<00:02:03.100> kind<00:02:03.429> of<00:02:03.729> an<00:02:03.909> exchange

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.690 

and<00:02:12.550> white<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.210> going<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.960> square<00:02:14.500> six

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700 

we<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.390> position<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.200> very<00:02:19.410> hard

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
we have a position that it's very hard

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.449 
we have a position that it's very hard
to<00:02:19.800> judge<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.990> game<00:02:22.230> why<00:02:22.650> went<00:02:22.950> wrong<00:02:23.250> he

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
to judge in the game why went wrong he

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.920
