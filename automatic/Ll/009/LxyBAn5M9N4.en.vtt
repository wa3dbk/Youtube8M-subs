00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
I don't want to just take my word for

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.150 
I don't want to just take my word for
how<00:00:02.879> good<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.179> platform<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.859> so<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> few<00:00:05.100> weeks

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
how good this platform is so a few weeks

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.750 
how good this platform is so a few weeks
ago<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.850> called<00:00:06.359> up<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.629> handful<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.020> companies

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
ago we called up a handful of companies

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
ago we called up a handful of companies
and<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:08.880> asked<00:00:09.210> them<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.630> they<00:00:10.110> would<00:00:10.260> send<00:00:10.620> out

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
and we asked them if they would send out

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.990 
and we asked them if they would send out
a<00:00:11.190> couple<00:00:12.090> engineers<00:00:12.599> each<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.849> they

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a couple engineers each to see what they

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990 
a couple engineers each to see what they
could<00:00:15.030> accomplish<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.870> two<00:00:16.289> weeks<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.980> an<00:00:17.490> SDK

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
could accomplish in two weeks are an SDK

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.660 
could accomplish in two weeks are an SDK
that<00:00:18.480> they'd<00:00:18.660> never<00:00:18.869> seen<00:00:19.289> before<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.949> fact

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that they'd never seen before in fact

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.349 
that they'd never seen before in fact
most<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.720> them<00:00:21.930> had<00:00:22.470> never<00:00:22.800> touched<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.430> Mac<00:00:23.730> for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
most of them had never touched a Mac for

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.870 
most of them had never touched a Mac for
development<00:00:24.840> before<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:26.340> did<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.849> what

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
development before and they did and what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.919 
development before and they did and what
they<00:00:27.420> accomplished<00:00:27.990> blew<00:00:28.859> me<00:00:29.099> away<00:00:29.779> it's<00:00:30.779> just

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
they accomplished blew me away it's just

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.900 
they accomplished blew me away it's just
fantastic<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.949> instead<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> having<00:00:32.820> me

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
fantastic and so instead of having me

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.000 
fantastic and so instead of having me
talk<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.540> through<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.960> I've<00:00:34.559> asked<00:00:34.920> the

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
weeks we wanted to do something that

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.649 
weeks we wanted to do something that
took<00:01:22.670> advantage<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.210> lot<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:23.539> different

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
took advantage of a lot of the different

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.480 
took advantage of a lot of the different
features<00:01:23.990> of<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.439> device<00:01:24.740> I'm<00:01:25.250> everything

from the touch screen to the
accelerometer<00:01:27.319> we<00:01:27.920> wanted<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.189> have<00:01:28.399> video

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
accelerometer we wanted to have video

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.940 
accelerometer we wanted to have video
and<00:01:29.299> audio<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.380> want<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.560> have<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.709> game<00:01:30.829> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
and audio you want to have a game that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.770 
and audio you want to have a game that
described<00:01:31.340> all<00:01:31.549> of<00:01:31.579> them<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.539> game<00:01:32.659> that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
described all of them so the game that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.760 
described all of them so the game that
we<00:01:32.840> chose<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.289> game<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.469> we<00:01:33.619> have<00:01:33.740> a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
we chose is a game that we have a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.830 
we chose is a game that we have a
production<00:01:34.069> called<00:01:34.280> spore<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.569> idea<00:01:35.780> of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
production called spore and the idea of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.599 
production called spore and the idea of
spores<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.469> about<00:01:36.619> taking<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:37.069> microorganism

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
spores it's about taking a microorganism

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.699 
spores it's about taking a microorganism
from<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.329> primordial<00:01:38.719> soup<00:01:39.229> at<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.439> bottom

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
from the primordial soup at the bottom

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.559 
from the primordial soup at the bottom
of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.890> ocean<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.429> helping<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.090> evolve<00:01:41.359> and

accelerometer<00:01:53.060> tilted<00:01:53.780> right<00:01:53.989> and<00:01:54.140> last<00:01:54.319> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
accelerometer tilted right and last you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.749 
accelerometer tilted right and last you
get<00:01:54.709> some<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.009> motion<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.489> you<00:01:55.549> saw

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
get some of that motion that you saw

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.839 
get some of that motion that you saw
earlier<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.179> previous<00:01:56.450> demo<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:58.340> basic

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
earlier in that previous demo the basic

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.969 
earlier in that previous demo the basic
goal<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.420> game<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.629> to<00:01:59.810> take<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.649> spore

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
goal of the game is to take the spore

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.410 
goal of the game is to take the spore
and<00:02:01.129> eat<00:02:01.250> anything<00:02:01.459> smaller<00:02:01.909> than<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.239> and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and eat anything smaller than you and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.880 
and eat anything smaller than you and
avoid<00:02:02.599> anything<00:02:02.869> larger<00:02:03.349> than<00:02:03.379> you<00:02:05.709> if<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:06.770> do

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
avoid anything larger than you if you do

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.199 
avoid anything larger than you if you do
a<00:02:06.920> good<00:02:07.009> job<00:02:07.069> of<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.459> you're<00:02:07.670> rewarded<00:02:08.090> by

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
a good job of that you're rewarded by

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.639 
a good job of that you're rewarded by
what<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.539> call<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.810> evolution<00:02:09.259> editor<00:02:09.530> and

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
what we call the evolution editor and

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.110 
what we call the evolution editor and
the<00:02:09.709> evolution<00:02:09.920> editor<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.579> a<00:02:10.610> great<00:02:10.879> place

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the evolution editor is a great place

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.640 
the evolution editor is a great place
for<00:02:11.329> us<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.720> take<00:02:11.810> advantage<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.379> lot<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.590> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
for us to take advantage of a lot of the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.259 
for us to take advantage of a lot of the
touchscreen<00:02:13.099> capabilities<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.910> device

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
touchscreen capabilities of this device

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.460 
touchscreen capabilities of this device
we've<00:02:14.870> gone<00:02:14.989> from<00:02:15.110> sort<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.379> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
we've gone from sort of the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.780 
we've gone from sort of the
accelerometer<00:02:16.010> now<00:02:16.190> we're<00:02:16.340> playing<00:02:16.519> with<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
accelerometer now we're playing with the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.479 
accelerometer now we're playing with the
touch<00:02:17.440> what's<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.530> great<00:02:18.680> about<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.250> it

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
touch what's so great about this is it

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.979 
touch what's so great about this is it
allows<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.940> customize<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.600> game<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.840> two

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
allows you to customize the game in two

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.390 
allows you to customize the game in two
different<00:02:21.139> ways<00:02:21.380> first<00:02:21.829> we're<00:02:22.250> going<00:02:22.340> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
different ways first we're going to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.890 
different ways first we're going to
customize<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> gameplay<00:02:23.329> a<00:02:23.359> little<00:02:23.630> bit<00:02:23.750> so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
customize the gameplay a little bit so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.120 
customize the gameplay a little bit so
John's<00:02:24.200> going<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.440> go<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.799> using<00:02:25.069> his

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
John's going to go in here and using his

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.080 
John's going to go in here and using his
finger<00:02:25.370> he's<00:02:25.489> just<00:02:25.609> going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> go<00:02:25.880> ahead<00:02:25.940> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
finger he's just going to go ahead and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.180 
finger he's just going to go ahead and
touch<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.690> offensive<00:02:27.049> tract<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.709> he's<00:02:28.099> going

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
touch the offensive tract and he's going

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.680 
touch the offensive tract and he's going
to<00:02:28.250> add<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.579> a<00:02:28.639> pair<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:28.880> formidable-looking

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.319 
to add in a pair of formidable-looking
mandibles<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.620> front<00:02:30.799> of<00:02:30.859> our<00:02:30.950> sport

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
mandibles here on the front of our sport

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.759 
mandibles here on the front of our sport
so<00:02:32.329> you<00:02:32.389> see<00:02:32.540> those<00:02:32.690> appear<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.109> front<00:02:33.349> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
so you see those appear on the front the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.569 
so you see those appear on the front the
next<00:02:33.950> thing<00:02:34.010> we're<00:02:34.160> going<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.489> we're

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
next thing we're going to do is we're

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:35.530 
next thing we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> play<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> little<00:02:35.209> bit<00:02:35.329> of<00:02:35.389> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
going to play with a little bit of a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.940 
going to play with a little bit of a
creative<00:02:35.959> personalization<00:02:36.650> here<00:02:36.769> now<00:02:36.829> this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
creative personalization here now this

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.680 
creative personalization here now this
part<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.340> more<00:02:37.700> about<00:02:37.819> making<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> sport<00:02:38.540> look

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
part is more about making the sport look

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.970 
part is more about making the sport look
cool<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.019> interesting<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.680> less<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:39.889> do

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
cool and interesting and it's less to do

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.379 
cool and interesting and it's less to do
with<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.160> gameplay<00:02:40.549> but<00:02:41.000> he's<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.329> go

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
with the gameplay but he's going to go

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.460 
with the gameplay but he's going to go
ahead<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.540> use<00:02:41.690> his<00:02:41.840> finger<00:02:42.109> and<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:42.260> start

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
ahead and use his finger and just start

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.629 
ahead and use his finger and just start
moving<00:02:42.769> stuff<00:02:42.889> around<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.430> think<00:02:43.489> he's

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
moving stuff around so I think he's

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.949 
moving stuff around so I think he's
going<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> move<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.060> eyes<00:02:44.180> forward<00:02:44.599> here<00:02:44.840> and

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
going to move the eyes forward here and

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.690 
going to move the eyes forward here and
he's<00:02:45.349> just<00:02:45.560> touching<00:02:45.919> and<00:02:46.040> moving<00:02:46.069> these<00:02:46.400> four

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
he's just touching and moving these four

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.280 
he's just touching and moving these four
so<00:02:46.880> imagine<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:47.930> we've<00:02:48.079> done<00:02:48.109> in

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
so imagine this is all we've done in

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.870 
so imagine this is all we've done in
about<00:02:48.380> two<00:02:48.739> weeks<00:02:48.769> but<00:02:49.160> we<00:02:49.280> had<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> lot<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.639> time

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
about two weeks but we had a lot of time

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.430 
about two weeks but we had a lot of time
you<00:02:50.060> could<00:02:50.180> imagine<00:02:50.389> us<00:02:50.660> stretching<00:02:51.079> this<00:02:51.200> for

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
you could imagine us stretching this for

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.259 
you could imagine us stretching this for
out<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.739> adding<00:02:52.010> collars<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.669> really<00:02:53.120> making

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
out and adding collars and really making

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.000 
out and adding collars and really making
this<00:02:53.389> like<00:02:53.599> almost<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.230> play<00:02:54.470> area<00:02:54.650> two

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
this like almost like a play area two

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.129 
this like almost like a play area two
people<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.489> personalize<00:02:55.970> their<00:02:56.180> spores<00:02:56.480> let's

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
people to personalize their spores let's

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.120 
people to personalize their spores let's
go<00:02:57.200> ahead<00:02:57.319> bring<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.560> support<00:02:57.829> back<00:02:57.950> into

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
go ahead bring that support back into

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.309 
go ahead bring that support back into
the<00:02:58.220> game

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
the game

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.110 
the game
now<00:03:00.920> talk<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.159> little<00:03:01.280> about<00:03:01.400> develop-<00:03:01.849> notice

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
now talk a little about develop- notice

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.300 
now talk a little about develop- notice
we're<00:03:02.209> moving<00:03:02.420> from<00:03:02.510> level<00:03:02.840> 15<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.650> level<00:03:03.859> 16

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
we're moving from level 15 to level 16

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.459 
we're moving from level 15 to level 16
and<00:03:05.180> when<00:03:05.389> we<00:03:05.480> first<00:03:05.689> came<00:03:05.810> we<00:03:05.870> sat<00:03:06.260> down<00:03:06.290> and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:06.469 
and when we first came we sat down and

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.780 
and when we first came we sat down and
started<00:03:06.829> working<00:03:06.920> with<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.280> framework<00:03:07.639> it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
started working with the framework it

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.280 
started working with the framework it
took<00:03:07.939> us<00:03:08.030> about<00:03:08.180> two<00:03:08.239> days<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:08.959> cocoa

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
took us about two days to get cocoa

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.080 
took us about two days to get cocoa
touch<00:03:09.469> up<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:09.859> running<00:03:10.129> once<00:03:10.579> we<00:03:10.730> had<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:10.879> up

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
touch up and running once we had that up

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.339 
touch up and running once we had that up
and<00:03:11.180> running<00:03:11.269> we<00:03:11.749> were<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:11.930> able<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.200> bring

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
and running we were then able to bring

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.280 
and running we were then able to bring
in<00:03:12.439> our<00:03:12.530> entire<00:03:12.859> game<00:03:13.519> development<00:03:13.879> and<00:03:14.290> got

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
in our entire game development and got

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.390 
in our entire game development and got
the<00:03:15.409> whole<00:03:15.560> game<00:03:15.739> up<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:15.980> running<00:03:16.189> so<00:03:16.280> we're

these different kinds of spores and
experimenting<00:03:25.849> with<00:03:25.879> what<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.150> thought<00:03:26.329> what

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
experimenting with what we thought what

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.640

in<00:03:30.560> fact<00:03:30.769> accelerometer<00:03:31.400> was<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:31.609> comfortably

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
in fact accelerometer was so comfortably

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
in fact accelerometer was so comfortably
are<00:03:32.060> showing<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:32.389> a<00:03:32.450> bunch<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.689> Apple

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
are showing it to a bunch of Apple

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.539 
are showing it to a bunch of Apple
employees<00:03:33.409> so<00:03:33.829> they<00:03:33.919> could<00:03:34.069> get<00:03:34.159> a<00:03:34.219> sense<00:03:34.459> of

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
employees so they could get a sense of

and lastly we want to experiment the
video<00:03:38.449> capability<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.079> we<00:03:39.139> threw<00:03:39.319> in<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.439> little

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
video capability so we threw in a little

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.990 
video capability so we threw in a little
cutscene<00:03:39.919> here<00:03:40.129> at<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> end<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.819> show

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
cutscene here at the end just to show

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.159 
cutscene here at the end just to show
