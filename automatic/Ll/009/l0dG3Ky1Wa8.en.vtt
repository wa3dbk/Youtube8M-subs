the heat and especially over the thread
but<00:03:26.910> stress<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.450> always<00:03:27.900> traveling<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
but stress is always traveling to the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.390 
but stress is always traveling to the
place<00:03:29.610> with<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> lowest<00:03:30.209> temperature<00:03:30.900> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the lowest temperature is probably to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.000
