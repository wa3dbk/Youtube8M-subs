00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
round of 16 of the Korean Air OSL and

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
round of 16 of the Korean Air OSL and
this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.089> Juan<00:00:15.809> Roe<00:00:16.049> vs.<00:00:16.590> IVA<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
this is going to be Juan Roe vs. IVA and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.099 
this is going to be Juan Roe vs. IVA and
this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:18.060> game<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.750> mean<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this is this game it I mean it's the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
this is this game it I mean it's the
last<00:00:19.289> game<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.859> makes<00:00:20.039> sense<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
last game so it makes sense that it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.830 
last game so it makes sense that it
would<00:00:20.550> happen<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.939> way<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.600> game<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
would happen this way but this game is

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.640 
would happen this way but this game is
gonna<00:00:22.109> determine<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.850> fate<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.109> group

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
gonna determine the fate of the group

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.390 
gonna determine the fate of the group
swimming<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.880> fate<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> group<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
swimming the fate of the group and and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.830 
swimming the fate of the group and and
yeah<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> mean<00:00:29.910> that's<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.660> these

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
yeah so I mean that's actually all these

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.330 
yeah so I mean that's actually all these
groups<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.230> coming<00:00:31.470> down<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> last<00:00:31.830> game

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
groups are coming down to the last game

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
groups are coming down to the last game
to<00:00:33.030> determine<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.660> happens<00:00:34.020> come<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> think

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to determine what happens come to think

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
to determine what happens come to think
of<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.860> sometimes<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.030> game<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of it so sometimes the game is the the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.830 
of it so sometimes the game is the the
group<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.200> already<00:00:37.440> decided<00:00:37.920> by<00:00:38.040> Game<00:00:38.280> six

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
group is already decided by Game six

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
group is already decided by Game six
there's<00:00:39.840> nothing<00:00:40.140> else<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.680> happen<00:00:40.860> but

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
there's nothing else that can happen but

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's nothing else that can happen but
in<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.270> case<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> come<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
in this case it is going to come down to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
in this case it is going to come down to
the<00:00:44.789> wire<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> reason<00:00:45.420> why<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the wire and the reason why is this is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.660 
the wire and the reason why is this is
Cal<00:00:46.800> flash<00:00:47.309> hiva<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.969> Quan<00:00:48.360> rose<00:00:48.600> group<00:00:48.960> okay

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Cal and flash each have a score of 2 and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.110 
Cal and flash each have a score of 2 and
one<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.020> group<00:00:55.230> hyah<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.969> one

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
one in the group hyah has one and one

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
one in the group hyah has one and one
and<00:00:57.149> Cano<00:00:57.600> has<00:00:57.870> owned<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and Cano has owned two so what that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.750 
and Cano has owned two so what that
means<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.609> if<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.410> 0<00:01:01.590> wins<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.430> game

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
means is that if I of 0 wins this game

hyah we'll all have to do a threeway
tiebreaker<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.810> who<00:01:09.990> advances<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:10.740> the

tiebreaker to see who advances from the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.030 
tiebreaker to see who advances from the
group<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:12.350> Kwan<00:01:13.350> row<00:01:13.710> wins<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.740> hyah<00:01:16.740> and

callum fox i won and so callum flash

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
callum fox i won and so callum flash
will<00:01:22.320> automatically<00:01:22.799> advance<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:24.240> very

then come send with real a tiebreaker
wouldn't<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.580> be<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.759> chance<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.119> Hiva<00:01:53.330> somehow

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
wouldn't it be a chance of Hiva somehow

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
hard to tell the difference between the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.370 
hard to tell the difference between the
unit<00:02:37.880> some<00:02:38.090> time<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.630> hopefully<00:02:39.290> goes<00:02:39.680> ok<00:02:41.380> yeah

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
unit some time so hopefully goes ok yeah

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.740 
unit some time so hopefully goes ok yeah
this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.709> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
this is a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.380 
this is a
kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.170> interesting<00:02:44.350> map<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.370> well<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:46.240> a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
kind of interesting map as well it's a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.090 
kind of interesting map as well it's a
four<00:02:46.600> player<00:02:46.780> map<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.380> obviously<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.950> see

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
four player map so obviously you see

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.960 
four player map so obviously you see
both<00:02:48.250> players<00:02:50.070> heading<00:02:51.070> there<00:02:51.310> their

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
both players heading there their

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.630 
both players heading there their
overlords<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.890> opposite<00:02:53.890> corner<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.460> no

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
overlords to the opposite corner so no

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.070 
overlords to the opposite corner so no
one<00:02:54.820> is<00:02:54.940> going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> get<00:02:55.270> asked<00:02:55.540> out<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
one is going to get asked out in and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.370 
one is going to get asked out in and
it's<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.320> very<00:02:56.350> long<00:02:56.890> distance<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:57.970> well<00:02:58.450> so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
it's a very long distance as well so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.870 
it's a very long distance as well so
it'll<00:03:00.010> be<00:03:00.040> interesting<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:00.580> how<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.790> works

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
it'll be interesting to see how it works

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.130 
it'll be interesting to see how it works
because<00:03:01.209> neither<00:03:01.390> player<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.810> going<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.020> have

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
because neither player is going to have

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.540 
because neither player is going to have
any<00:03:02.320> good<00:03:02.500> information<00:03:03.160> sometimes<00:03:05.280> yeah<00:03:06.280> I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
mean sometimes well before player map

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.010 
mean sometimes well before player map
they'll<00:03:09.790> send<00:03:10.030> their<00:03:10.180> overlords<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> rock

I've been putting down a gas before pool
very<00:03:36.820> very<00:03:37.209> interesting<00:03:37.720> here<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:39.580> that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
very very interesting here what that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.600 
very very interesting here what that
means<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.150> well<00:03:40.600> either<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.320> he<00:03:41.980> could<00:03:42.190> go<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.580> I

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
means is well either a he could go for I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.460 
means is well either a he could go for I
guess<00:03:42.970> speed<00:03:43.239> or<00:03:43.420> something<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:43.870> but

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
guess speed or something like that but

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.100 
guess speed or something like that but
it<00:03:44.590> probably<00:03:44.830> means<00:03:45.070> he's<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.489> try<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.110> go

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
it probably means he's gonna try to go

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.210 
it probably means he's gonna try to go
for<00:03:47.320> a<00:03:47.380> very<00:03:47.590> quick<00:03:47.739> layer<00:03:49.860> try<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:50.950> go<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.070> a

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.960 
300 mils in the bank what's he gonna do
oh<00:03:58.930> he's<00:03:59.200> got<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> plan<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.799> land<00:04:00.160> an<00:04:00.430> extractor

oh he's got a plan to land an extractor

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.729 
oh he's got a plan to land an extractor
perfect<00:04:01.390> so<00:04:01.540> he's<00:04:01.780> actually<00:04:02.110> not<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.680> be

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
perfect so he's actually not going to be

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.800 
perfect so he's actually not going to be
too<00:04:03.489> bad<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.700> shape<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:04.090> pulls<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.720> bit

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
too bad a shape is pulls a little bit

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.259 
too bad a shape is pulls a little bit
behind<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.290> that's<00:04:05.470> actually<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.799> good<00:04:06.010> thing

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
behind but that's actually a good thing

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.460 
behind but that's actually a good thing
for<00:04:07.269> your<00:04:07.390> pool<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.690> be<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:07.989> behind<00:04:08.200> is

gasps Allah behind as well hi Val
already<00:04:10.720> Mining<00:04:11.049> gas<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.440> basically<00:04:11.890> what

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
already Mining gas so basically what

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.770 
already Mining gas so basically what
it's<00:04:12.220> going<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.370> come<00:04:12.519> down<00:04:12.579> to<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.940> when<00:04:13.120> when

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
it's going to come down to is when when

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.920 
it's going to come down to is when when
it<00:04:14.290> gets<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.100> spires<00:04:15.610> I<00:04:16.060> was<00:04:16.600> gonna<00:04:16.750> have

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
it gets to the spires I was gonna have

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.719 
it gets to the spires I was gonna have
more<00:04:17.140> gas<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.650> bank<00:04:17.859> he's<00:04:18.220> mining<00:04:18.579> all

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
more gas in the bank he's mining all

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.120 
more gas in the bank he's mining all
this<00:04:18.880> gas<00:04:19.060> right<00:04:19.359> now<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.769> he's<00:04:20.890> gonna<00:04:21.010> have

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
this gas right now so he's gonna have

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.640 
this gas right now so he's gonna have
more<00:04:21.280> gas<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.700> bank<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.690> make<00:04:23.169> more<00:04:23.320> muted

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
more gas in the bank to make more muted

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.960 
more gas in the bank to make more muted
early<00:04:23.890> on<00:04:24.010> basically<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.520> mean<00:04:24.669> look<00:04:24.760> at<00:04:24.850> this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
early on basically I mean look at this

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.030 
early on basically I mean look at this
you<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.270> see<00:04:25.450> first<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.500> all<00:04:26.590> he's<00:04:26.740> gonna<00:04:26.860> have

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
you can see first of all he's gonna have

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.580 
you can see first of all he's gonna have
enough<00:04:27.220> for<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.400> layer<00:04:27.640> as<00:04:27.850> soon<00:04:28.450> as<00:04:28.750> that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
enough for a layer as soon as that

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.400 
enough for a layer as soon as that
his<00:04:29.710> crime<00:04:29.920> he's<00:04:30.220> gonna<00:04:30.340> plant<00:04:30.640> on<00:04:30.790> layer<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
his crime he's gonna plant on layer and

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.660 
his crime he's gonna plant on layer and
quadrant<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.440> mean<00:04:32.560> time<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:32.950> going<00:04:33.460> for<00:04:33.610> an

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
quadrant I mean time that's going for an

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.300 
quadrant I mean time that's going for an
expansion<00:04:34.150> now<00:04:34.420> as<00:04:34.570> well<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.140> really<00:04:36.100> this

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
expansion now as well and really this

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.890 
expansion now as well and really this
might<00:04:36.610> work<00:04:36.760> out<00:04:36.970> pretty<00:04:37.300> well<00:04:37.420> for<00:04:37.600> him

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
might work out pretty well for him

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.480 
might work out pretty well for him
because<00:04:38.020> he<00:04:38.380> there's<00:04:38.620> no<00:04:38.800> way<00:04:38.920> he's<00:04:39.070> gonna<00:04:39.190> get

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
because he there's no way he's gonna get

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.160 
because he there's no way he's gonna get
any<00:04:39.670> pressure<00:04:40.030> from<00:04:40.830> IVA<00:04:41.830> IVA<00:04:42.370> has<00:04:43.240> when<00:04:44.050> he's

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
any pressure from IVA IVA has when he's

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.470 
any pressure from IVA IVA has when he's
gonna<00:04:44.320> send<00:04:44.560> out<00:04:44.620> some<00:04:44.680> zerglings<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:45.520> he's

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
gonna send out some zerglings but he's

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.700 
gonna send out some zerglings but he's
not<00:04:46.660> able<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.900> make<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.080> ton<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.410> zerglings

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
not able to make a ton of zerglings

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.840 
not able to make a ton of zerglings
right<00:04:48.160> away<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:50.380> because<00:04:50.490> he's<00:04:51.490> gone<00:04:51.670> for

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
right away it's because he's gone for

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.220 
right away it's because he's gone for
that<00:04:51.910> layer<00:04:52.180> very<00:04:52.420> quickly<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.900> spent

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
that layer very quickly so that spent

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.950 
that layer very quickly so that spent
some<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.410> his<00:04:53.560> money<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.450> anyway<00:04:55.450> so<00:04:55.510> nice<00:04:55.750> got

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
some of his money and anyway so nice got

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.870 
some of his money and anyway so nice got
the<00:04:56.080> gas<00:04:56.260> coming<00:04:56.500> in<00:04:56.710> let's<00:04:57.280> see<00:04:57.490> I'm<00:04:57.760> gonna

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
the gas coming in let's see I'm gonna

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.400 
the gas coming in let's see I'm gonna
try<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.270> keep<00:04:58.360> an<00:04:58.510> eye<00:04:58.600> on<00:04:58.660> high<00:04:58.840> vis<00:04:59.020> gas<00:04:59.200> to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
try and keep an eye on high vis gas to

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.100 
try and keep an eye on high vis gas to
see<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.680> he<00:04:59.770> makes<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.660> metabolic<00:05:01.660> boost<00:05:01.840> but<00:05:02.080> I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
see if he makes a metabolic boost but I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.590 
see if he makes a metabolic boost but I
don't<00:05:02.470> think<00:05:02.680> he<00:05:02.890> is<00:05:03.220> unless<00:05:04.210> he<00:05:04.360> made<00:05:04.510> it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
don't think he is unless he made it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.440 
don't think he is unless he made it
earlier<00:05:06.930> see<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:07.990> corner<00:05:08.290> does<00:05:09.240> Manos<00:05:10.240> just

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
earlier see the corner does Manos just

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.720 
earlier see the corner does Manos just
reached<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.720> hundred<00:05:11.020> gas<00:05:11.170> let's<00:05:12.070> see<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.580> he

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
reached a hundred gas let's see is he

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.830 
reached a hundred gas let's see is he
gonna<00:05:12.850> see<00:05:13.390> you<00:05:13.480> till<00:05:13.570> our<00:05:15.030> horses<00:05:16.030> lair<00:05:16.360> what

you can see at the bottom right hyva

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.080 
you can see at the bottom right hyva
building<00:05:23.560> up<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.740> lot<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.040> gas<00:05:24.430> right<00:05:24.460> now<00:05:24.880> so

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
building up a lot of gas right now so

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.330 
building up a lot of gas right now so
once<00:05:25.360> has<00:05:25.990> spire<00:05:26.410> well<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.010> gonna<00:05:27.160> be<00:05:27.310> a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
once has spire well it's gonna be a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.460 
once has spire well it's gonna be a
while<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:27.790> if<00:05:27.850> you<00:05:27.940> get<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.840> spire<00:05:29.110> point

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
while but if you get to the spire point

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.020 
while but if you get to the spire point
in<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.620> game<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.980> he's<00:05:30.130> gonna<00:05:30.220> have<00:05:30.430> extra

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
in the game and he's gonna have extra

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.410 
in the game and he's gonna have extra
gas<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.480> the<00:05:31.540> bank<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.830> use<00:05:32.980> on<00:05:33.160> nudism<00:05:33.490> anyway

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
gas in the bank to use on nudism anyway

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.320 
gas in the bank to use on nudism anyway
so<00:05:34.990> but<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:35.500> cuanto<00:05:36.400> i<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.670> has<00:05:36.790> an<00:05:36.910> Avenger

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
so but but cuanto i think has an Avenger

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.660 
so but but cuanto i think has an Avenger
because<00:05:37.600> now<00:05:37.810> he's<00:05:38.470> a<00:05:38.530> little<00:05:38.890> bit<00:05:38.980> behind<00:05:39.130> and

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
because now he's a little bit behind and

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
because now he's a little bit behind and
all<00:05:39.760> of<00:05:39.850> his<00:05:39.910> tech<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.270> everything<00:05:40.540> like<00:05:40.630> that

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
all of his tech and everything like that

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.480 
all of his tech and everything like that
but<00:05:40.840> he's<00:05:41.050> got<00:05:41.170> an<00:05:41.290> expansion<00:05:41.920> he's<00:05:42.010> got<00:05:42.190> extra

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
but he's got an expansion he's got extra

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.390 
but he's got an expansion he's got extra
drones<00:05:42.820> as<00:05:43.030> well<00:05:43.270> i<00:05:43.300> believe<00:05:43.450> oh<00:05:44.400> well

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
drones as well i believe oh well

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.160 
drones as well i believe oh well
actually<00:05:45.670> it<00:05:45.880> looks<00:05:46.030> like<00:05:46.180> somehow<00:05:46.600> hiva<00:05:46.960> is

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
actually it looks like somehow hiva is

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.790 
actually it looks like somehow hiva is
ahead<00:05:47.440> on<00:05:47.620> supplies<00:05:49.200> which<00:05:50.200> is<00:05:50.320> interesting

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
ahead on supplies which is interesting

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.320 
ahead on supplies which is interesting
piece<00:05:51.040> well<00:05:51.670> i<00:05:51.700> guess<00:05:51.910> they're<00:05:52.060> not<00:05:52.180> eating

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
piece well i guess they're not eating

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.930 
piece well i guess they're not eating
now<00:05:52.540> but<00:05:52.780> anyway<00:05:53.410> but<00:05:53.980> cuanto<00:05:54.340> has<00:05:54.490> this<00:05:54.610> extra

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
now but anyway but cuanto has this extra

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.780 
now but anyway but cuanto has this extra
hatchery<00:05:55.270> up<00:05:55.360> now<00:05:55.510> just<00:05:55.870> pop<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:56.470> he<00:05:57.400> is<00:05:57.610> in

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
hatchery up now just pop so he is in

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.790 
hatchery up now just pop so he is in
really<00:05:58.150> good<00:05:58.360> shape<00:05:58.420> on<00:05:58.870> that

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
really good shape on that

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
really good shape on that
somehow<00:06:01.800> they<00:06:01.920> evened<00:06:02.190> out<00:06:02.250> in<00:06:02.370> gas<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:02.790> i

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
somehow they evened out in gas so i

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.300 
somehow they evened out in gas so i
think<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:03.150> means<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.600> hot<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:04.050> hiva<00:06:04.350> got

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
think that means that hot that hiva got

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.880 
think that means that hot that hiva got
zerglings<00:06:06.020> which<00:06:07.020> is<00:06:07.170> interesting<00:06:07.650> that<00:06:07.680> well

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
zerglings which is interesting that well

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.140 
zerglings which is interesting that well
we<00:06:08.010> probably<00:06:08.160> both<00:06:08.490> got<00:06:08.730> it<00:06:08.850> yeah<00:06:08.970> they're

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
we probably both got it yeah they're

we probably both got it yeah they're
near<00:06:09.360> my<00:06:09.470> speed<00:06:10.470> upgrade<00:06:10.740> zerglings

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
near my speed upgrade zerglings
