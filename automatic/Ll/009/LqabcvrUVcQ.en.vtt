00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
while on the G pad 10.1 you really do

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
back is a little unfortunate especially

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.249 
back is a little unfortunate especially
on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> 10.1<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.390> budget<00:01:54.659> tablets<00:01:54.930> they

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on the 10.1 but for budget tablets they

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:07.889 
on the 10.1 but for budget tablets they
actually<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:55.799> sound<00:01:56.219> half-bad

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.749 

now<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.959> displays<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:09.560> obviously<00:02:10.399> different

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
now the displays are obviously different

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.150 
now the displays are obviously different
sizes<00:02:11.209> with<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> 7-inch<00:02:12.080> screen<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.739> G<00:02:12.920> pad

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
10.1 respectively but even though

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.740

they're<00:02:19.489> different<00:02:19.700> screen<00:02:20.120> sizes<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
they're different screen sizes the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.410 
they're different screen sizes the
resolution<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.500> exactly<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> same<00:02:22.580> with<00:02:22.880> 1280

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.949

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.630 
by 800 pixels on both so not a very high
resolution<00:02:27.260> meaning<00:02:28.010> you'll<00:02:28.220> be<00:02:28.340> able<00:02:28.550> to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
resolution meaning you'll be able to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.479 
resolution meaning you'll be able to
spot<00:02:28.880> pixels<00:02:29.420> pretty<00:02:29.690> easily<00:02:30.340> especially<00:02:31.340> on

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
spot pixels pretty easily especially on

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.910 
spot pixels pretty easily especially on
the<00:02:31.670> 10.1<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:32.810> again<00:02:33.110> these<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:33.590> pretty

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the 10.1 but again these are pretty

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.400 
the 10.1 but again these are pretty
mid-range<00:02:34.430> tablets<00:02:35.019> outside<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.260> low

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.199 
mid-range tablets outside of the low

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.300 
resolution however these screens aren't
half-bad<00:02:38.510> they've<00:02:39.410> got<00:02:39.680> pretty<00:02:39.860> decent

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
half-bad they've got pretty decent

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.309

looking<00:02:40.549> colors<00:02:40.910> viewing<00:02:41.480> angles<00:02:41.840> are<00:02:42.019> pretty

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
looking colors viewing angles are pretty

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.259 
looking colors viewing angles are pretty
good<00:02:42.500> too<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.069> they<00:02:43.220> get<00:02:43.400> plenty<00:02:43.670> bright<00:02:44.030> so

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
good too and they get plenty bright so

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.309 
good too and they get plenty bright so
there's<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:44.569> much<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.870> complain<00:02:45.230> about

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
there's not much to complain about

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.340 
there's not much to complain about
outside<00:02:46.069> of<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.489> resolution<00:02:47.150> also<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.110> same

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
outside of the resolution also the same

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
on both are the internal specs because

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.479

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
an issue and they both played games just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.910 
an issue and they both played games just
fine<00:03:23.060> whether<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.630> was<00:03:23.780> simplistic<00:03:24.260> game<00:03:24.620> or

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
really not much to be worried about as

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.640 
really not much to be worried about as

on<00:03:46.700> either<00:03:46.910> one<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.420> it's<00:03:47.540> pretty<00:03:47.780> basic<00:03:47.989> just

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
