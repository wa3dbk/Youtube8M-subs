00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
there'd be a more story behind it but

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
there'd be a more story behind it but

user or something but he said that the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.490 
user or something but he said that the
best<00:02:44.550> thing<00:02:44.640> about<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.150> nothing<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.170> even

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
best thing about is nothing is even

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.250
