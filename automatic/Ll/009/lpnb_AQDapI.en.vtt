that didn't happen and anyways i'm going

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.820 
that didn't happen and anyways i'm going
to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> showing<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.330> mage<00:00:27.510> guide<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.170> guess

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to be showing you the mage guide I guess

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.120 
to be showing you the mage guide I guess
it's<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.670> best<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.750> i<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.470> tried<00:00:31.800> both

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
it's the best because i have tried both

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240 
it's the best because i have tried both
melee<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> range<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.649> i<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.920> 99

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
melee and range as you can see i get 99

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.090 
melee and range as you can see i get 99
range<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> still<00:00:37.110> work<00:00:37.290> pretty<00:00:37.500> fast<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
range so it still work pretty fast but

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.970 
range so it still work pretty fast but
the<00:00:38.579> melee<00:00:38.910> guide<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> best

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the melee guide way it's not the best

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.130 
the melee guide way it's not the best
and<00:00:41.460> especially<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> armor

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and especially because of the armor

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
and especially because of the armor
anyways<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.520> into<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.030> i
