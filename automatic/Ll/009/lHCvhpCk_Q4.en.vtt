00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
avoid who wander around aimlessly and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.960 
avoid who wander around aimlessly and
through<00:00:43.140> walls<00:00:43.470> but<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.309> bigger<00:00:44.489> threat<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
through walls but the bigger threat is

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.549 
through walls but the bigger threat is
the<00:00:45.180> scrolling<00:00:45.450> screen<00:00:45.900> which<00:00:46.080> traps<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the scrolling screen which traps you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.540 
the scrolling screen which traps you
behind<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.010> walls

behind the walls

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.280 
behind the walls
I<00:00:47.580> guess<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> wall<00:00:48.180> behind<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> caving<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
I guess the wall behind you is caving in

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.009 
I guess the wall behind you is caving in
I<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.879> avoid<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> inevitability

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
I don't know to avoid the inevitability

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.600 
I don't know to avoid the inevitability
of<00:00:52.050> getting<00:00:52.470> trapped<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> dead<00:00:53.159> end<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
of getting trapped at a dead end you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.149 
of getting trapped at a dead end you
have<00:00:54.089> a<00:00:54.120> powerup<00:00:54.600> called<00:00:55.019> a<00:00:55.199> make<00:00:55.409> break<00:00:55.800> which

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
have a powerup called a make break which

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.770 
have a powerup called a make break which
allows<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> open<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.210> hole<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> wall

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
allows you to open up a hole in the wall

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
allows you to open up a hole in the wall
to<00:00:57.960> slip<00:00:58.199> through<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:59.159> create<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.550> new<00:00:59.730> piece<00:00:59.909> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
to slip through or create a new piece of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.910 
to slip through or create a new piece of
wall<00:01:00.269> giving<00:01:00.659> you<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> ability<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.350> make<00:01:01.650> or

wall giving you the ability to make or

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
wall giving you the ability to make or
break<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> block<00:01:02.610> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> move<00:01:03.870> against<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
break a block if you move against the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
break a block if you move against the
wall<00:01:04.559> while<00:01:04.739> pressing<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> fire<00:01:05.460> button<00:01:05.729> to

wall while pressing the fire button to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
wall while pressing the fire button to
activate<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.600> you'll<00:01:07.170> break<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> if

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
activate this you'll break it and if

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800 
activate this you'll break it and if
you're<00:01:08.250> against<00:01:08.580> thin<00:01:08.820> air<00:01:09.030> it'll<00:01:09.540> create<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you're against thin air it'll create a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
you're against thin air it'll create a
block<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.620> never<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.460> mean<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> can

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
block which I never use I mean you can

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.230 
block which I never use I mean you can
use<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.110> block<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> zombie<00:01:13.800> at<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.010> emergency

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
use it to block a zombie at an emergency

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
use it to block a zombie at an emergency
but<00:01:15.240> otherwise<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.500> increase

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
but otherwise it's just gonna increase

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
but otherwise it's just gonna increase
your<00:01:17.100> chances<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> being<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:17.909> -<00:01:18.060> due<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
your chances of being in - due to the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.020 
your chances of being in - due to the
time<00:01:18.990> limit<00:01:19.130> there's<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> time<00:01:20.820> for

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
time limit there's not a lot of time for

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
time limit there's not a lot of time for
rational<00:01:21.390> solutions<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
rational solutions like this so you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
rational solutions like this so you
pretty<00:01:23.640> much<00:01:23.760> want<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.150> use<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> make

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
pretty much want to use all you make

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
pretty much want to use all you make
breaks<00:01:25.260> solely<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.980> breaking<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:27.060> especially

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
breaks solely for breaking it especially

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450 
breaks solely for breaking it especially
since<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.870> a<00:01:27.900> limited<00:01:28.230> quantity<00:01:28.460> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
since you have a limited quantity you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520 
since you have a limited quantity you
start<00:01:29.730> out<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.510> but<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.230> can<00:01:31.320> pick

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
start out with only one but you can pick

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.060 
up the pace from level to level by the
4th<00:01:54.030> level<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.840> fucking<00:01:55.170> fast<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.800> be

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
4th level it's really fucking fast so be

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
4th level it's really fucking fast so be
on<00:01:56.160> your<00:01:56.310> toes<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.610> adjustments<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> mazes

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
on your toes for adjustments the mazes

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
on your toes for adjustments the mazes
are<00:01:58.830> always<00:01:59.130> randomly<00:01:59.610> generated<00:02:00.120> -<00:02:00.300> so<00:02:00.720> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
are always randomly generated - so you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
are always randomly generated - so you
can't<00:02:01.110> master<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.710> best<00:02:01.920> paths<00:02:02.160> possible

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
can't master the best paths possible

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.960 
can't master the best paths possible
it's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.330> new<00:02:03.420> experience<00:02:03.810> every<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.970> one

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
it's a new experience every time one

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.370 
it's a new experience every time one

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
thing that sucks though is getting

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.169
