00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
I never thought the entry conditions

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.469 
I never thought the entry conditions
down<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:48.470> would<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.860> important<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.300> four

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
down here would be so important so four

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.820 
down here would be so important so four
and<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> half<00:01:50.630> inches<00:01:51.020> in<00:01:51.080> very<00:01:51.470> very<00:01:51.619> small

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
and a half inches in very very small

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.359 
and a half inches in very very small
amount<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:54.259> morning<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:54.920> wasn't

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
amount and this morning it wasn't

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.810 
amount and this morning it wasn't
reaching<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.090> top<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:58.100> be<00:01:58.190> honest<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.640> that

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
reaching the top so to be honest on that

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.660 
reaching the top so to be honest on that
and<00:01:59.780> I<00:02:00.320> think<00:02:00.649> what<00:02:00.830> happened<00:02:01.190> overnight

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and I think what happened overnight

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.490 
and I think what happened overnight
is<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:04.429> gone<00:02:04.640> little<00:02:04.849> air<00:02:05.030> lock<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.319> just

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
is it gone little air lock so I just

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.120 
is it gone little air lock so I just
opened<00:02:06.890> hope<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:11.230> not<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
opened hope like that not like that and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.400 
opened hope like that not like that and
nothing<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.790> will<00:02:14.270> just<00:02:14.480> depend<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:15.430> how<00:02:17.410> we

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
nothing that will just depend on how we

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.930 
nothing that will just depend on how we
set<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:19.069> entry<00:02:20.080> conditions<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.940> this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
set up your entry conditions here this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.059 
set up your entry conditions here this
is<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.240> heard<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:23.599> one<00:02:23.780> hand<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.349> join<00:02:24.950> up

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
is we heard with one hand to do join up

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.699 
is we heard with one hand to do join up
test<00:02:25.310> shoots<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.870> here<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.110> go<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.470> gone

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
for me fascinating but maybe and this I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.830 
for me fascinating but maybe and this I
think<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:54.099> has<00:02:54.220> super<00:02:54.849> potential<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
think it has super potential just to

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.229 
think it has super potential just to
learn<00:02:56.019> more<00:02:56.319> about<00:02:56.709> why<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.849> doing<00:02:58.090> this

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
learn more about why it's doing this

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.960 
learn more about why it's doing this
there's<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.290> other<00:02:59.410> one

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
there's the other one

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.500 
there's the other one
well<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.000> got<00:03:01.209> for<00:03:01.620> overnight<00:03:02.620> now<00:03:03.510> just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
well I got for overnight now just

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.289 
well I got for overnight now just
because<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> set<00:03:05.080> up<00:03:05.310> purposefully<00:03:06.310> wrong<00:03:06.519> and

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
because I set up purposefully wrong and

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.059 
because I set up purposefully wrong and
it's<00:03:07.420> still<00:03:07.569> still<00:03:08.290> pumping<00:03:08.530> water<00:03:08.739> along

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
it's still still pumping water along

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.880 
it's still still pumping water along
here<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.880> will<00:03:10.030> stop<00:03:10.239> doing<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.860> a

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
here it will stop doing that for a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.580 
here it will stop doing that for a
minute<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:12.430> pump<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.790> water<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:14.410> can

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
minute and then pump of water you can

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.539 
minute and then pump of water you can
see<00:03:14.769> oh<00:03:17.880> it'll<00:03:18.880> induce<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.540> mess<00:03:20.130> anyway<00:03:21.130> that's

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
see oh it'll induce a mess anyway that's

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.180 
see oh it'll induce a mess anyway that's
it<00:03:21.670> thanks<00:03:22.030> bye
