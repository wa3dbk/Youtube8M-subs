00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
just have a little orange lesson here to

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.780

drinking so much more water and I think

drinking so much more water and I think
limiting<00:04:35.580> those<00:04:35.820> all<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.570> artificial

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
limiting those all that artificial

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.780 
limiting those all that artificial
sweeteners<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.130> diet<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.670> is

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
sweeteners that are in the diet so it is

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
it but it definitely made a difference I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.520 
it but it definitely made a difference I
know<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.030> some<00:04:42.330> people<00:04:42.360> crave<00:04:42.870> more<00:04:43.110> sweets

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
know that some people crave more sweets

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.250 
know that some people crave more sweets
when<00:04:44.280> they're<00:04:44.460> drinking<00:04:44.670> diet<00:04:45.090> drinks<00:04:45.630> so

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
when they're drinking diet drinks so

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.050 
when they're drinking diet drinks so
that<00:04:46.440> could<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.650> part<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.430> may<00:04:47.610> make<00:04:47.910> you

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
that could be part of it it may make you

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.510 
that could be part of it it may make you
hungrier<00:04:48.650> but<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.680> know<00:04:49.800> it's<00:04:50.220> made<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> big

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
hungrier but I know it's made a big

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.600 
hungrier but I know it's made a big
difference<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.510> me<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.930> now<00:04:52.200> I<00:04:52.590> mean<00:04:53.040> I<00:04:53.220> may

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
difference for me and now I mean I may

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.640 
difference for me and now I mean I may
have<00:04:53.850> one<00:04:54.300> diet<00:04:54.630> drink<00:04:54.930> every<00:04:55.200> couple<00:04:55.410> weeks

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
have one diet drink every couple weeks

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.890 
have one diet drink every couple weeks

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
but I don't miss it it's just I'm kind

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.100 
but I don't miss it it's just I'm kind
of<00:04:57.930> over<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.230> um<00:04:58.830> as<00:04:59.580> far<00:04:59.910> as<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.090> alcohol<00:05:00.510> you

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
of over it um as far as the alcohol you

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.330 
of over it um as far as the alcohol you
know<00:05:01.140> you<00:05:01.320> get<00:05:01.560> used<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.010> glass<00:05:02.280> of

know you get used to have a glass of

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.860 
know you get used to have a glass of
wine<00:05:02.520> every<00:05:02.820> night<00:05:03.030> but<00:05:03.300> one<00:05:03.480> glass<00:05:03.660> of<00:05:03.690> wine

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
wine every night but one glass of wine

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.280 
wine every night but one glass of wine
is<00:05:04.200> 150<00:05:05.040> calories<00:05:05.450> think<00:05:06.450> about<00:05:06.720> how<00:05:07.260> that

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
is 150 calories think about how that

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.170 
is 150 calories think about how that
adds<00:05:07.650> up<00:05:07.920> and<00:05:08.160> then<00:05:08.310> you<00:05:08.430> start<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.790> cut<00:05:09.030> that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
adds up and then you start to cut that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.270 
adds up and then you start to cut that
out<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.720> know<00:05:09.900> maybe<00:05:10.110> maybe<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.920> only<00:05:11.040> have<00:05:11.250> a

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
out you know maybe maybe you only have a

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.710 
out you know maybe maybe you only have a
drink<00:05:11.580> two<00:05:11.820> or<00:05:11.850> three<00:05:12.090> times<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.420> week<00:05:12.450> as

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
drink two or three times a week as

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.500 
drink two or three times a week as
opposed<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.200> every<00:05:13.560> night<00:05:13.710> having<00:05:14.100> something

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
opposed to every night having something

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.610 
opposed to every night having something
that's<00:05:15.510> really<00:05:15.900> going<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.140> cut<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.380> lot<00:05:16.530> of

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
that's really going to cut a lot of

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.950 
that's really going to cut a lot of
calories<00:05:16.830> out<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:18.330> just<00:05:18.480> don't<00:05:18.600> need<00:05:18.900> it

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
calories out and you just don't need it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.080 
calories out and you just don't need it
you<00:05:19.380> know<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:19.920> that's<00:05:20.070> kind<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.310> my<00:05:20.490> thinking

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
you know so that's kind of my thinking

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.030 
you know so that's kind of my thinking
on<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.750> it's<00:05:21.990> like<00:05:22.260> said<00:05:22.500> that's<00:05:22.800> work

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
on that and it's like said that's work

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.950 
on that and it's like said that's work
for<00:05:23.310> me<00:05:23.400> it's<00:05:23.580> been<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.790> great<00:05:24.300> part<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:24.870> this

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
for me it's been a great part of this

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.390 
for me it's been a great part of this
year<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.440> think's<00:05:25.710> really<00:05:25.800> contributed

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
year that I think's really contributed

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.280 
year that I think's really contributed
to<00:05:26.520> being<00:05:26.700> able<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.910> maintain<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.690> healthy

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
to being able to maintain a healthy

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.040 
to being able to maintain a healthy
weight<00:05:28.320> my<00:05:29.010> last<00:05:29.310> thing<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.880> changing<00:05:30.660> up<00:05:30.870> the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
weight my last thing is changing up the

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.780 
weight my last thing is changing up the
exercise<00:05:31.560> routine<00:05:31.980> if<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.550> don't<00:05:32.700> exercise

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
exercise routine if you don't exercise

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.850 
exercise routine if you don't exercise
at<00:05:33.240> all<00:05:33.330> definitely<00:05:34.200> getting<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.620> jam<00:05:34.830> and

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
at all definitely getting the jam and

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.560 
at all definitely getting the jam and
sore<00:05:35.160> exercising<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:35.880> that<00:05:36.180> would<00:05:36.270> be<00:05:36.360> great

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
sore exercising and that would be great

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.830 
sore exercising and that would be great
but<00:05:37.160> for<00:05:38.160> me<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.640> know<00:05:38.700> I've<00:05:38.970> been<00:05:39.000> exercising
