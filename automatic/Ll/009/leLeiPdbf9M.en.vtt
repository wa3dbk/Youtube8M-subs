go check them out absolutely beast but

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
go check them out absolutely beast but
anyways<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> game<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.820> were<00:00:35.910> watching

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
anyways the game put you were watching

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.350 
anyways the game put you were watching
in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> background<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.739> world's<00:00:38.160> highest

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
in the background is the world's highest

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.619 
in the background is the world's highest
73<00:00:39.360> gunstreak<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> essay<00:00:40.950> 805<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
73 gunstreak with the essay 805 and the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
73 gunstreak with the essay 805 and the
reason<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.930> find<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.710> impressive<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
reason I find it so impressive is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
reason I find it so impressive is
because<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.420> essay<00:00:45.690> 205<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
because it's the essay 205 and if you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
because it's the essay 205 and if you
guys<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.579> quite<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
guys don't know this gonna has quite a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.569 
guys don't know this gonna has quite a
high<00:00:48.690> amount<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> recoil<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.039> opinion<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
high amount of recoil in my opinion it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
high amount of recoil in my opinion it
almost<00:00:51.000> calls<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> need<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> grip<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> he

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
almost calls for the need of grip and he

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
almost calls for the need of grip and he
wasn't<00:00:53.850> using<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.660> game<00:00:54.899> play

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
wasn't using it in this game play

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
wasn't using it in this game play
obviously<00:00:55.620> he<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.860> using<00:00:56.070> red<00:00:56.370> dot<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
obviously he was using red dot and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
obviously he was using red dot and
extended<00:00:57.329> mag<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> nonetheless<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.680> still

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
extended mag and nonetheless he still

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
extended mag and nonetheless he still
got<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> 73<00:00:59.760> gunstreak<00:01:00.149> yes<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.690> strike<00:01:01.050> zone

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
got the 73 gunstreak yes on strike zone

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
got the 73 gunstreak yes on strike zone
but<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.770> i<00:01:01.920> said<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.340> gun<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
but like i said this gun is not the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.600 
but like i said this gun is not the
easiest<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.320> pretty<00:01:04.559> impressive<00:01:05.369> but

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
easiest to use so pretty impressive but

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
easiest to use so pretty impressive but
obviously<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.570> dead<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> perk

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
obviously it was using dead I the perk

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
obviously it was using dead I the perk
which<00:01:07.799> helps<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.240> compensates

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
which helps out you know it compensates

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.240 
which helps out you know it compensates
for<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> recoil<00:01:10.500> because<00:01:10.680> he<00:01:10.950> killed<00:01:11.189> people

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
for the recoil because he killed people

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
for the recoil because he killed people
in<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.729> bullets<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> time<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> recoil

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in two bullets so by the time the recoil

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690 
in two bullets so by the time the recoil
is<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.220> probably<00:01:14.400> already

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
is going up they're probably already

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
is going up they're probably already
dead<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.080> pretty<00:01:16.320> smart<00:01:16.619> load<00:01:16.860> out

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
dead so that's a pretty smart load out

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.179 
dead so that's a pretty smart load out
there<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.640> anyways<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.500> guys<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.950> end

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there but anyways so if you guys do end

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
there but anyways so if you guys do end
