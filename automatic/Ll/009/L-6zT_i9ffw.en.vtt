00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 physics inside has nothing casual 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.109
 but it is a symbol of the best ship the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.929
 Prince's world has a strength 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.630
 aerial with tayfun aircraft is very large 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 the tie you make this eurofighter plane that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.190
 it's called that it developed between four 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 countries for decades and that newly 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.640
 now it is fully operational in the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.990
 European Union 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 england of a certain amount these 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 planes and shawls very pictures 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 important malvinas in our 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 moment when a group of tornado 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.340
 then he replaced it with the iphones of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.510
 new and those planes are totally 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.510
 unbalancing there is nothing 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 6 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.540
 in life 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.180
 a fighter plane that we are taught and 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.699
 we see from within is one of the most 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.470
 most modern aircraft in the world 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.750
 currently and the truth that is 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.570
 awesome nothing avionics is a jump 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.210
 generational the eurofighter is not only 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.200
 the most modern and most technological aircraft 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 that the European industry has never done 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.970
 It is also a plane that we have designed 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.440
 the pilots for other pilots the way 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.020
 that we interact with the plane 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.610
 it's through a keyboard that carries 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.229
 Built-in cabinet three screens to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.550
 color the cerac display which is a 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.020
 projector that presents the images 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.690
 in infinity so that we do not have to 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.100
 adjust the eyes various controls in 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.250
 the joystick and on the lever 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.509
 gases and also controls the voice 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 flight controls of the plane have also 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.410
 been designed with a concept that 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.090
 called carefree handling that is 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.530
 basically that the pilot does not have to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
 take into account any limitations of the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.860
 plane he simply worries the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.899
 combat and the maneuvers that you have to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.850
 make moves the plane and the plane gets 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.440
 limits itself to prevent 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.270
 never exceed the limits of the plane 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
 we do not reach dangerous limits so much 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.910
 for the plane as for own 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.910
 pilot's physiology
