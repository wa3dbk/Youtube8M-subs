stock mini cooper s and it was fun a lot
of<00:01:50.990> fun<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.850> car<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.119> think<00:01:53.329> when<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:53.959> had

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
of fun and that car I think when I had

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.840 
of fun and that car I think when I had
it<00:01:54.499> had<00:01:54.679> like<00:01:54.859> a<00:01:54.889> hundred<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.459> sixty-eight

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
it had like a hundred and sixty-eight

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.359 
it had like a hundred and sixty-eight
horsepower<00:01:56.509> or<00:01:56.659> something<00:01:56.990> like<00:01:57.109> that<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.829> GP

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
horsepower or something like that the GP

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.239 
horsepower or something like that the GP
had<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.729> think<00:01:59.060> 210<00:01:59.749> horsepower<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.619> they<00:02:01.009> got

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
had I think 210 horsepower and they got

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.459 
had I think 210 horsepower and they got
about<00:02:01.520> 200<00:02:02.090> pounds<00:02:02.479> out<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.990> yeah

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
about 200 pounds out of it yeah

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.410 
about 200 pounds out of it yeah
and<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.039> kept<00:02:04.279> thinking<00:02:04.369> about<00:02:04.670> my<00:02:04.849> car

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and so I just kept thinking about my car

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.070 
and so I just kept thinking about my car
with<00:02:05.719> another<00:02:06.020> 50<00:02:06.709> horsepower<00:02:07.179> -<00:02:08.179> 200<00:02:08.630> pounds

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
with another 50 horsepower - 200 pounds

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.960 
with another 50 horsepower - 200 pounds
and<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.259> thought<00:02:09.440> my<00:02:09.679> car<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:09.979> fun<00:02:10.429> where<00:02:10.910> it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
and I thought my car was fun where it

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.720 
and I thought my car was fun where it
was<00:02:11.090> at<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.840> weight<00:02:12.080> horsepower<00:02:12.800> back<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.490> I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
was at the weight horsepower back then I

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.450 
was at the weight horsepower back then I
can't<00:02:14.420> imagine<00:02:14.540> how<00:02:14.900> much<00:02:15.020> fun<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.290> GP<00:02:15.830> would

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
can't imagine how much fun that GP would

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.650 
can't imagine how much fun that GP would
be<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.880> see<00:02:17.210> them<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.450> eBay<00:02:17.810> everyone

and it is it feels heavy and big for a
mini<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.880> still<00:02:57.000> they're<00:02:57.120> gonna<00:02:57.210> try<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
mini but still they're gonna try to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
spice it up with a jcw package which

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.560 
spice it up with a jcw package which
should<00:02:59.580> because<00:02:59.820> it's<00:03:00.030> gonna<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> same

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
should because it's gonna be the same

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.350 
should because it's gonna be the same
jcw<00:03:01.290> engine<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.640> believe<00:03:02.850> so

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
jcw engine that's in this I believe so

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.630 
jcw engine that's in this I believe so
so<00:03:03.570> that's<00:03:04.020> why<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> fun<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.190> they<00:03:05.370> went

so that's why this is fun and they went
they<00:03:06.180> went<00:03:06.420> from<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:08.300> supercharger<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.450> a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
they went from a supercharger to a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.420 
they went from a supercharger to a
turbocharger<00:03:10.350> right<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.100> terms<00:03:11.220> of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
turbocharger right on this in terms of

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.860 
turbocharger right on this in terms of
doors<00:03:11.700> power<00:03:11.910> what<00:03:12.120> kind<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.300> power<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> said

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
doors power what kind of power you said

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.540 
doors power what kind of power you said
this<00:03:12.990> with<00:03:13.140> me<00:03:13.200> hundred<00:03:13.590> seven<00:03:14.040> horsepower

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
this with me hundred seven horsepower

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.480 
this with me hundred seven horsepower
and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.720> 11<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.440> over<00:03:17.190> pull<00:03:17.340> over

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
and then you get to 11 on over pull over

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.340 
and then you get to 11 on over pull over
boost<00:03:17.820> it's<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.510> four<00:03:18.750> horsepower<00:03:19.020> makes

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
boost it's that four horsepower makes

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.740 
is a room inside yeah and and I do not
know<00:05:04.590> how<00:05:04.770> many<00:05:04.830> engineers<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:05.879> it<00:05:06.060> but<00:05:06.599> they

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
know how many engineers do it but they

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.980 
know how many engineers do it but they
put<00:05:06.779> more<00:05:07.259> room<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:08.069> little<00:05:08.370> tiny<00:05:08.639> car<00:05:09.029> than

put more room in a little tiny car than
you<00:05:10.169> can<00:05:10.349> imagine<00:05:10.439> the<00:05:10.949> difference<00:05:11.159> from<00:05:11.580> the

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
you can imagine the difference from the

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.339 
you can imagine the difference from the
S<00:05:12.029> to<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.449> JCW

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
S to the JCW

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.080 
S to the JCW
is<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:15.139> think<00:05:16.139> about<00:05:16.319> six<00:05:16.740> grand<00:05:16.919> yeah<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:17.849> for

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
is I think about six grand yeah and for

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.080 
is I think about six grand yeah and for
that<00:05:18.210> you<00:05:18.419> get<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:19.099> upgraded<00:05:20.099> engine<00:05:20.580> you<00:05:20.939> get

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
that you get the upgraded engine you get

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.570 
that you get the upgraded engine you get
upgraded<00:05:21.539> suspension<00:05:21.919> upgraded<00:05:22.919> brakes<00:05:23.219> and

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
upgraded suspension upgraded brakes and

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.580 
upgraded suspension upgraded brakes and
then<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> interior<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.930> get<00:05:25.259> all<00:05:25.439> the

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
then the interior you get all the

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
election you know all the electronics

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.689 
election you know all the electronics
bells<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.779> whistles<00:05:28.139> that's<00:05:28.590> very<00:05:29.310> small
