00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700 
really did enjoy doing that show I
really<00:01:39.060> did<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.049> me<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.650> general

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
really did but I think for me in general

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.179 
really did but I think for me in general
I<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.490> maybe<00:01:42.000> doing<00:01:42.360> four<00:01:42.720> days<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> week

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
I think maybe doing four days a week

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
I think maybe doing four days a week
it's<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.460> too<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.299> your<00:01:45.420> sub<00:01:45.659> boxes

it's just too much for your sub boxes

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.270 
it's just too much for your sub boxes
maybe<00:01:46.320> maybe<00:01:46.890> i'll<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.520> switch<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280
