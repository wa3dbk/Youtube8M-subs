download<00:02:14.470> let's<00:02:15.430> say<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.819> I'm<00:02:15.940> going<00:02:15.970> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300

download let's say that I'm going to
Louisiana<00:02:16.480> tomorrow<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.590> need<00:02:17.650> the

Louisiana tomorrow and I need the
approach<00:02:18.160> plates

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
approach plates

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.949

now<00:02:19.720> click<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.170> Louisiana<00:02:20.650> button<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.750> say

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
now click the Louisiana button and I say

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.350 
now click the Louisiana button and I say
download<00:02:23.620> linked<00:02:24.220> file<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.940> says<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
download linked file and it says that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.260 
download linked file and it says that
it's<00:02:28.480> started<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.489> can<00:02:30.670> come<00:02:30.880> back<00:02:30.970> over

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's started and I can come back over

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.520 
it's started and I can come back over
here<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.569> see<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.810> indeed<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:33.550> has<00:02:33.760> started

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
here and see that indeed it has started

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.510 
here and see that indeed it has started
and<00:02:35.530> I'm<00:02:35.620> gonna<00:02:35.739> go<00:02:35.830> ahead<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:35.980> cancel<00:02:36.250> that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
and I'm gonna go ahead and cancel that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.729 
and I'm gonna go ahead and cancel that
so<00:02:36.700> it'll<00:02:36.790> take<00:02:37.000> quite<00:02:37.209> some<00:02:37.420> time<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:38.560> does

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
so it'll take quite some time it does

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.290 
so it'll take quite some time it does
take<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> while<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.220> download<00:02:39.459> these<00:02:40.000> things

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
take a while to download these things

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.180 
take a while to download these things
but<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.630> guess<00:02:40.840> compared<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.590> getting<00:02:41.920> them<00:02:42.069> in

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
but I guess compared to getting them in

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.740 
but I guess compared to getting them in
the<00:02:42.280> mail<00:02:42.459> or<00:02:42.670> having<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.030> drive<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the mail or having to drive to the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.900 
the mail or having to drive to the
airport<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.290> pick<00:02:44.320> up<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.680> copy<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
airport to pick up a copy the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.530 
airport to pick up a copy the
convenience<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.750> somewhat<00:02:47.680> mitigated<00:02:48.540> over

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
convenience is somewhat mitigated over

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.060 
convenience is somewhat mitigated over

here to the left again I can see the

plates in one single document the the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.900 
plates in one single document the the
downside<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.310> takes<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.610> lot<00:03:09.760> longer

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
downside is that it takes a lot longer

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.000 
downside is that it takes a lot longer
download<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.540> single<00:03:10.810> document<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.440> once<00:03:11.860> I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
download that single document but once I

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.729 
download that single document but once I
have<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.900> these<00:03:14.200> states<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> a

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
have it I have all of these states in a

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.800 
have it I have all of these states in a
single<00:03:15.040> PDF<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:18.070> first<00:03:18.310> thing<00:03:18.549> that'll<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.660> is

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
single PDF the first thing that'll do is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.030 
single PDF the first thing that'll do is
come<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.230> last<00:03:20.380> page<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.709> you're

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.910 
come to the last page that you're
editing<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:23.079> this<00:03:23.200> case<00:03:23.470> it's<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
editing and in this case it's the

the<00:04:00.180> Palmetto<00:04:01.180> or<00:04:01.720> where<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.200> Palmetto<00:04:02.590> are

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
the Palmetto or where the Palmetto are

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.890 
the Palmetto or where the Palmetto are
be<00:04:03.010> flying<00:04:03.280> yesterday<00:04:03.579> was<00:04:04.060> which<00:04:04.329> was<00:04:04.600> at

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
be flying yesterday was which was at

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.599 
be flying yesterday was which was at
cake<00:04:05.500> hub<00:04:05.970> that's<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.209> Columbia<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.340> here's

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
cake hub that's in Columbia and here's

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.890 
cake hub that's in Columbia and here's
the<00:04:09.790> approach<00:04:10.090> plate<00:04:10.359> for<00:04:10.690> for<00:04:11.230> Columbia<00:04:12.010> Cub

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the approach plate for for Columbia Cub

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.150 
the approach plate for for Columbia Cub
and<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.320> they<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.829> approach

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
and I can see they have to approach

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.469 
and I can see they have to approach
plates<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:17.169> I'll<00:04:17.320> choose<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.739> GPS<00:04:18.160> 431<00:04:18.760> and

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
plates and I'll choose the GPS 431 and

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.649 
plates and I'll choose the GPS 431 and
here<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.459> as<00:04:21.459> it<00:04:21.729> comes<00:04:21.909> up<00:04:22.120> it's<00:04:22.390> it's

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
here it is and as it comes up it's it's

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.630 
here it is and as it comes up it's it's
largely<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.140> same<00:04:23.229> size<00:04:23.680> as<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.010> paper<00:04:24.310> plate

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
largely the same size as a paper plate

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.400 
largely the same size as a paper plate
and<00:04:24.880> it's<00:04:25.330> very<00:04:25.630> very<00:04:25.870> readable

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
and it's very very readable

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.570 
and it's very very readable
the<00:04:26.530> detail<00:04:26.890> is<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.540> excellent<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.690> crisp<00:04:29.580> if

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
the detail is is excellent and crisp if

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.390 
the detail is is excellent and crisp if

that small print I probably have a

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
full full plate size I'll just shrink it

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
Colombia I could go repeat the bookmark

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.870 
Colombia I could go repeat the bookmark
sequence<00:05:10.750> but<00:05:11.680> now<00:05:11.800> I'm<00:05:11.950> largely<00:05:12.250> in<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.460> PDF

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
sequence but now I'm largely in the PDF

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.180

I<00:05:13.210> can<00:05:13.450> just<00:05:13.870> use<00:05:14.230> this<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.650> slide<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.100> next

I can just use this to slide to the next

next<00:05:19.750> page<00:05:19.960> after<00:05:20.230> that<00:05:20.380> I'll<00:05:21.160> get<00:05:21.460> into<00:05:21.820> the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
next page after that I'll get into the

the Conway Horry County Airport and if

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.070 
the Conway Horry County Airport and if
I'm<00:05:26.230> sure<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.800> Colombia<00:05:27.220> will<00:05:27.370> be<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:28.840> big

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
I'm sure that Colombia will be the big

I'm sure that Colombia will be the big

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
basically this is it this is how you use

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.260 
basically this is it this is how you use
the<00:05:33.910> iPad<00:05:34.330> as<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.980> an<00:05:35.980> EFP<00:05:36.400> for<00:05:36.850> instrument
