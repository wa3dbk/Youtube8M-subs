00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.200
 to me 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 welcome to a craft workshop 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.599
 in this opportunity we will develop the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.639
 manual work proposed in the election 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.639
 5 of the preschool and school level 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.930
 for this we need 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.340
 a coca leaf 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:32.439
 a pencil or scissors ruler of 30 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:36.399
 centimeters like mud down 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.600
 with stickers and other details to 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.410
 decorate 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.680
 a cardboard circle of 5 centimeters 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.310
 diameter 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.310
 on the sheet we will draw a line of 4 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.490
 centimeters to the edge of the sheet 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.610
 then we will divide the sheet into strips of 2 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.000
 centimeters 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.500
 and we will mark them approximately from 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 leave 14 strips 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.990
 then we proceed to cut them 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 and they will stay like that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.820
 at the top we will write the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.420
 phrase light for my life in letters for 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 Fill 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.000
 deliver the sheet to each child so that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 I can meet 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.890
 in rubber on the first strip of the sheet 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.650
 and in the unit 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.550
 to the contour 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.230
 at the end of the day 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.159
 you must 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.159
 also well 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.420
 and it will stay like that 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.940
 on how we will make each end of the strip 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.610
 and we will join them to the center of the circle 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:08.980
 and so that they have a more round shape 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 we will press lightly 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.530
 to decorate the children can use 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.230
 stickers of different shapes too 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.440
 they have micro-porous balls that 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 we paste with rubber 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.770
 or they can also use markers or 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.020
 creams to decorate subjective power 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.970
 finally cut a strip of 20 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.780
 centimeters by 2 centimeters wide 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.490
 in rubber the tips and paste them as if 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.490
 were some 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.110
 and it will fit you as follows 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.450
 another model that you can prepare is this 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.200
 where children will write the text and 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.209
 then they will cut the strips 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.550
 to decorate the girls could use 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.060
 colorful flowers and children stickers or 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.060
 balls 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.970
 this manual work will be very fun 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.250
 for children to let them decorate 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.280
 according to your creativity that god 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.280
 bless
