00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
to build and we'll try to do our best on

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.030 
to build and we'll try to do our best on
building<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.330> it<00:04:23.330> might<00:04:23.780> take<00:04:24.050> off<00:04:24.560> some<00:04:24.830> time

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
building it it might take off some time

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.830 
building it it might take off some time
from<00:04:25.250> our<00:04:25.430> let's<00:04:25.669> play<00:04:25.910> though

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
from our let's play though

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.520 
from our let's play though
but<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.410> think<00:04:27.710> it'll<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.980> worth<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.530> I

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
but I think it'll be worth it and I

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.760 
but I think it'll be worth it and I
think<00:04:31.100> that'll<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.720> video<00:04:33.290> isn't

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
think that'll be it for this video isn't

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.360 
think that'll be it for this video isn't
that<00:04:33.980> right<00:04:34.210> yeah<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.510> think<00:04:35.960> that's<00:04:36.370> horrible

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
that right yeah I think that's horrible

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.040
