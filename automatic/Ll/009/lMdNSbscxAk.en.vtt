this just looks really cool enlargement
enlargement<00:03:07.260> enlargement<00:03:07.709> enlargement<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.400> I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
enlargement enlargement enlargement as I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.660 
enlargement enlargement enlargement as I
said<00:03:08.879> before<00:03:08.909> these<00:03:09.450> are<00:03:09.690> supposedly<00:03:10.670> 16.2

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
said before these are supposedly 16.2

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.270 
said before these are supposedly 16.2
millimeters<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> think<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.920> tape<00:03:14.099> you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280

really<00:03:14.909> really<00:03:15.090> really<00:03:15.450> enlarging<00:03:16.940> honestly

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
really really really enlarging honestly

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.070 
really really really enlarging honestly
I<00:03:17.970> thought<00:03:18.120> they're<00:03:18.330> gonna<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> lot<00:03:19.019> more

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
I thought they're gonna be a lot more

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.619 
I thought they're gonna be a lot more
enlarging<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.099> get<00:03:20.310> these<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.790> 8<00:03:21.390> out

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
enlarging so I get these like it 8 out

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.080 
enlarging so I get these like it 8 out
of<00:03:21.690> 10<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.620> my<00:03:22.860> lenses<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.580> make<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:23.909> eyes

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
of 10 I like my lenses to make my eyes

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.649 
of 10 I like my lenses to make my eyes
look<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.830> dollish<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.340> even<00:03:27.060> alien<00:03:27.480> ish

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
look like dollish and even alien ish

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.150 
look like dollish and even alien ish
sometimes<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:29.400> my<00:03:29.430> lenses

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
sometimes like I like my lenses

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.980 
sometimes like I like my lenses
huge<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.360> as<00:03:31.570> big<00:03:31.630> as<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.290> can<00:03:32.470> get<00:03:32.650> them<00:03:32.770> um

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
huge like as big as you can get them um

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.010 
huge like as big as you can get them um

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
so probably like an 8 out of 10 for

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.930 
so probably like an 8 out of 10 for
enlargement<00:03:38.830> most<00:03:39.400> people<00:03:39.700> would<00:03:39.790> say

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
enlargement most people would say

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.610 
enlargement most people would say
probably<00:03:40.120> 10<00:03:40.510> 0<00:03:40.540> times<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.050> say<00:03:41.260> eight<00:03:41.440> out<00:03:41.590> of

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
probably 10 0 times I say eight out of

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.750 
probably 10 0 times I say eight out of
10<00:03:42.000> but<00:03:43.000> they<00:03:43.150> are<00:03:43.330> really<00:03:43.720> nice<00:03:44.110> like<00:03:44.760> they're
