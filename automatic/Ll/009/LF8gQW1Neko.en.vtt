 some ideas make-up the makeup of 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.670
 Mexican death I do not know 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.620

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.539
 too good at the base makeup was 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.010
 already planned for a little while and 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.690
 advance the date anyway for what 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.280
 is santa muerte she is going to be done 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.310
 also against the time level 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 scheduled for early September I have a little 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.500
 changed my style to make it there 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.420
 since I made pink I like 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.190
 not the pink I'm not very good there 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.570
 but I think it's good for your 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.820
 eyes to see something other than stuff 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.830
 weird skeletons of spiders and 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.240
 other dismal things on this chain 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.940
 I like all this stuff I 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.009
 do this for you I did not do this 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.110
 famous little tear that flows all over 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.180
 throughout the day you can see in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.860
 all pop art makeups 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.659
 because I had the pistachio 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.490
 all in all, to say that you see 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.140
 the one I make them your becker and if you 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.429

 provide you can leave me a little 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.610
 message in the comments 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.780
 I start makeup in colors in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.550
 using red it is criminal 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.929
 from lux london at the level of my 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.970
 eyebrows and adapting their structures 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.440
 with the shape that I like to give them 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.580
 plus the peculiarity of this red to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.409
 it is comfortable that he is completely 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.880
 maths it does not shine and that dry 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.350
 extremely fast what will be very 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.380
 useful for the details we will add 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.130
 about this product 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 I use a pink eye shadow 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.369
 fuchsia from make up academy that I 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.899
 has on all my 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.220
 eyebrows what will intensify the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.540
 color is well fixed the pigments 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.070
 then I choose the palette of 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.750
 correctors from peggy sage 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.310
 to correct the line of my eyebrows 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.049
 and in this way I perfect the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.970
 made which puts a lot more value 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.440
 the result with the body cream 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.299
 yellow from ford edge draws a 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.290
 first line of very thick eyeliner and 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.660
 very wide on the upper eyelid 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.370
 with a brush provided for this purpose as 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.079
 for the eyebrow in order to have a trace 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910
 much cleaner I rework the 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.620
 line with the corrector and to fix 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.060
 the color I apply the lighthouse line 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.410
 isolates himself as part of the same 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.340
 palette that I showed you all at 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.870
 start for the eyelid pattern 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.280
 lower I take the same type of 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.170
 cream and light blue hues this 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.239
 this time and I draw like small 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.799
 waves on the exteriors which in reality 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.500
 represent lashes trace so 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.640
 very exaggerated I admit it but I believe 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.709
 that now we are no longer at that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 near I fix with the color to date and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.319
 I take the opportunity to degrade to 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.969
 inside my eye 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.010
 go courage it's just a bad 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.840
 moment to pass we will apply on 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.609
 our mouth the famous lipstick 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.409
 that we previously used on our 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:14.030
 sources it is the result is special 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.799
 short as always I restructure the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 edges with my concealer and I'm using 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.379
 a pre-cut sponge to melt the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.060
 subject I then take care of points 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.769
 whites that I have on both sides 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.689
 opposite of my face and for that 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.519
 I use a brush with the round tip 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.590
 and if you do not have one, you can 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.480
 use an anti-trust account instead 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.400
 will do it a lot with my 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 eyeliner from sergio alvarez I will 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.579
 to mark several parts of my face 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.169
 starting with the eyebrow area I 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.389
 make a new line of eyeliner flush 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.799
 eyelashes over the first and I'm going 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.069
 contours and this one to do it 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.069
 stand out 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.669
 I add a black kohl pencil on the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.199
 mucosa located inside the eye 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.879
 as with the yellow eyeliner line I 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.469
 come outline and the blue motiv and I 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.019
 be careful what to show be end 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.489
 not to damage it 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:13.970
 and I make a last mark on the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:15.979
 nose when it comes to mud 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.690
 absolutely the same as for the eyes I 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.190
 trace the edges to the liner by cons I 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.359
 add an effect of umbro center for 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.460
 recall once again the theme of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.509
 pop art 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.039
 I take the body cream 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.509
 white from fardel to constitute 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.509
 an illusion of light on my lips 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.100
 and I apply my mascara only on 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.840
 the upper eyelashes to finally be in 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.110
 total fit with the movement 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.430
 american british 50s 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.960
 if pop art seduced then you can 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.930
