really cool awesome friends but it was
also<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.830> little<00:05:31.100> bit<00:05:31.190> isolating<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
also a little bit isolating so the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.450 
also a little bit isolating so the
internet<00:05:32.630> YouTube<00:05:33.140> or<00:05:33.440> like<00:05:33.860> social<00:05:34.220> media

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
internet YouTube or like social media

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
was this way for us or to connect so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.620 
was this way for us or to connect so
that<00:05:37.040> was<00:05:37.160> kind<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.400> like<00:05:37.550> always<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.910> goal<00:05:38.210> in

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
that was kind of like always a goal in

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.250 
that was kind of like always a goal in
helping<00:05:39.170> and<00:05:39.320> sharing<00:05:39.700> and<00:05:40.700> how<00:05:41.060> do<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.270> stay<00:05:41.870> so

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
helping and sharing and how do I stay so

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.200 
helping and sharing and how do I stay so
positive<00:05:42.290> it's<00:05:43.130> like<00:05:43.310> you're<00:05:43.460> always<00:05:43.670> coming

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
positive it's like you're always coming

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.780 
positive it's like you're always coming
back<00:05:44.420> to<00:05:44.630> making<00:05:44.990> sure<00:05:45.230> that<00:05:45.650> positivity<00:05:46.310> is

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
back to making sure that positivity is

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.270 
back to making sure that positivity is
your<00:05:47.060> focus<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:47.990> I<00:05:48.350> guess<00:05:48.830> that's<00:05:49.070> how<00:05:49.250> I

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
your focus and so I guess that's how I

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.090 
your focus and so I guess that's how I
say<00:05:49.700> stay<00:05:50.270> positive<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:50.930> stay<00:05:51.020> on<00:05:51.470> track<00:05:51.800> and

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
say stay positive and stay on track and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.370 
say stay positive and stay on track and
I<00:05:52.580> just<00:05:53.030> really<00:05:53.660> want<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.900> feel<00:05:54.050> good<00:05:54.080> to<00:05:54.350> know
