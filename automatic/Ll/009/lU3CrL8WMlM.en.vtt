00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.059
 do not 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 video of the channel of the roadman dic in my 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.480
 previous video I'm explaining how 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.910
 get a replacement for a nexus 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 5 good a nexus in this case use a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.950
 nexus 5 to replace it when we 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.349
 it comes by default in a bad state has 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.470
 something that in series will not touch and would not touch 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.739
 and that way well then in this video 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 I will explain how to proceed in the case 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.960
 of having to do with a product 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 apple or an iphone an ipad a computer 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 same as with the nexus if the face that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 has your device been produced by 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.930
 a fall to the ground by a blow or because 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.600
 it has wet for example these things do not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 they come under guarantee so neither 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.900
 bother trying to change it because 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.450
 you will only waste time will realize 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.530
 that is wet they will realize if they 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.770
 you have fallen the floor has a screen 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 crunch and that does not go into warranty enters 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 as a guarantee, what I have told you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.460
 previous times if the gps does not work 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 well or the coverage does not work well or 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.120
 has some small defect in the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.360
 screen that you see some light or 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.760
 dead pixels 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080
 things so it has not been produced by 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.580
 blame our 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.640
 in apple what I did because I 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.860
 also an iphone 5 is to call this 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.540
 first phone I have 2 I will leave you the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.000
 two phone numbers over here in the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 description of the video also so that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.510
 if one of the phones does not work 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.490
 because it is with the other they will tell you 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.650
 surely the serial number of the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.290
 product that you want to fall that you change 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.660
 and your paper and what is yours 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.400
 mail account with which you download 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.990
 appstore apps 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.450
 after asking what is it that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.570
 go to the device and such and recommend that 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 then almost always is what they recommend 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.740
 to try to solve the problem is 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.630
 that subtracts the phone from zero be 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.360
 put it in Haitian restore it not center 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.070
 backup and will try to see if 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 it works that way or if you already 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.570
 you know that all this is not going to be fixed 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.190
 in this way you have to say yes 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.590
 that you have already done everything you are told 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.940
 to get them to send us another 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.140
 substitution eye if you invent it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.790
 you send an iphone that for whatever 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.470
 they have any bullshit that does not come 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.990
 as a guarantee and you want them to be 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 in another new in quotes new 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.090
 They will check if, when 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.820
 iPhone arrives there fault that 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 you said is not the one that plays now they 're going 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.300
 to return the same iphone that you had 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.250
 so do not try to make the plane 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.160
 because no longer school are they not so 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.170
 splendid giving him 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.620
 there is a refuge and everyone is 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.840
 we should not look a little more imagine 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.510
 it will be because of the crisis but we're going on the skin 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 I doubt that you have crises were once 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.590
 you call the phone that I have already put you 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.720
 in video information and 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.050
 data of the device that you want to replace 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.320
 and they let you do two things two 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.930
 One way is that you go to look for the 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.350
 package the package is the iphone case 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.210
 and the dealer takes it look at him 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.640
 there in apple what are the days that 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.670
 five days later maybe they fix it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.280
 and they give it back to you but of course all those 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.470
 days you are without device there is another 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.440
 way that is the next ask you 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.780
 leave directly and another iphone is worth 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.390
 this is fine for me it cost me to do this 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.160
 29 euros exactly lost 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.480
 directly distributed did not bring me 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.990
 another iphone that full kaiser 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.250
 It cost me 29 euros at the time it was 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.080
 they carry your iphone and they are 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.300
 fixing weights 45 days maybe not 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 you have another phone to use and 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.070
 this way then directly when you 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.410
 you give the old one and they leave you the new one and not 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.450
 you are more practically a few minutes 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.810
 no device batches that turn it on and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.390
 start it then if you can I so 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.160
 least I did it like that to see 29 euros and nothing 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.260
 more comes to the middle divided with the other 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.330
 I gave him the old man and in the middle the new 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.570
 the dealer who comes and leaves you the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.030
 new already take the old and the same 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.800
 already takes the necessary things to paste 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.930
 in the package the stickers and all this 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.640
 does not have to accept anything then in that 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.620
 aspect is better than google more 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.900
 easy more comfortable 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.850
 What I do not like more than google 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.010
 is that the device that they leave you is not 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.190
 very new new in moves exactly is 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.800
 refurbished refurbished which is in theory 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.990
 because I asked 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.030
 Apple asks what it is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.650
 exactly an iphone refurbished what 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.720
 they told me on the phone that 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.060
 it has to be true esque 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.729
 refurbished is that they use the same 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.069
 screws that everything else that is 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.780
 new battery shell display but that 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.729
 the screws that can be used are 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.009
 they re-use does not have many 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.930
 screws there are no funds I say it be 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.400
 truth or lie I do not know but good 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.830
 that if it's just the screws is 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.509
 as if it was new in google instead 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.419
 they give you a completely new one with the 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.030
 box to the charger and everything here in apple what 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.400
 they bring you is simply the iphone you 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.050
 gives on an iphone very well trace a video 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.569
 on my channel where he taught an iphone that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
 the furby set and I came perfect and 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.740
 It was an iphone 5 black without minced or 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.810
 nothing almost impossible to achieve when 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.759
 you already place the order so that you 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.849
 replace before the 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.409
 dealer to change the phone and you 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.090
 they have withheld the money how much you 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.190
 stops exactly what it costs 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.780
 an iphone the iphone that you have sent and 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.969
 when the old device arrives and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.000
 they verify that the failure it has is 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:31.760
 due to a failure 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.180
 of series that you are not provoked you 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.590
 then in the guarantee is effective and you 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.900
 they return the money that they have withheld 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.960
 in the bank in this way is like 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.730
 we can ask for a replacement of a 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.350
 apple device that you have not 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.700
 bought in the apple store that 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.260
 you bought on mediamarkt or in 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.870
 any other store like that directly 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.780
 in hand, I imagine that they themselves 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.030
 they will process all these procedures in this way 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.240
 say it I for example bought a tomtom 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.040
 in the middle markt after a short time 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.380
 a few months ago it worked badly 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.860
 so I had to use the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.200
 warranty 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.030
 I went to the media markt and they told me 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.490
 they could be in charge of sending the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.130
 package and receive it and such but they were going 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.700
 to take like two weeks more if 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.340
 I did directly, then I do not know if 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.990
 with these apple nexus themes you can 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.430
 might as well tell you the same thing I 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.230
 tell us we can manage but 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.880
 but maybe it takes more weeks than if 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.590
 you do it yourself I have no idea but 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.360
 you can try it since you have bought 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.400
 a physical store if you do not want 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.190
 complicate that you already see that in the case of 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.880
 apple is making a phone call 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.860
 just go to the store 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.030
 you ask and if you are too lazy 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.450
 so you do it directly by phone 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.300
 I would do it that way and that's the way in 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.160
 that I made the change of an iphone 5 with 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.920
 some that will try for an iphone 5 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.170
 refurbished and it was all good 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.050
 correctly and I stayed pretty you know 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.360
 the fact so that's how they are made 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.190
 the changes in apple is worth if it is 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.800
 served the video or if you liked nothing 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.570
 leave a like to share it with your networks 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.370
 social and if you're not yet 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.370
 subscribe is worth a greeting 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.860
 to time
