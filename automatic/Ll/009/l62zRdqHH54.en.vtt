00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.000
 premise when he was a baby at the moment 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.770
 to fill the castle of grayskull that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 my unwary parents bought me 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.150
 for a christmas never goes through my head 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.580
 to start with the good ones rather than the i 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 man combed by raffaella carrÃ  

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.170
 I immediately threw myself on skeletor 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 antagonist decidedly cooler but that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 what does all this have to do with the moment 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 to introduce a cardboard in which good 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 which in the end win come 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.920
 cold sores have long been insults 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 while the bad guys are always beaten 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.769
 The unquestioned are delrio fato 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 protagonists 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 I put the wicked in the cartoons often 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.989
 like them more because maybe closer 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.489
 to us that of the Samaritans 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.739
 we don't even have the white of the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.739
 eyes we are talking about calendar man 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 fifth series of the machinery line of the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 time since in Italy we do the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 good things, however, the first ad 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 be transmitted in the beautiful country 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 the plot in a nutshell the princess 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 the heir to the throne calendar of the realm of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 2900 after Christ and in the future it was 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 usurped by the autumn dynasty 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.299
 headed by the fantastic one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.610
 amazing with 30 incomparable 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.950
 princess Monday who usurped the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.619
 throne by setting up a circus dwarf 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 that is his brother the little prince on Saturday 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 however, even the princess serves on Monday 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.909
 I'm cosmo peacock and so travels in the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.040
 time to find the bad bird that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.320
 what comes out of that where 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.390
 work tina and beppe an agency 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 investigative whose owner has a name 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 between the ridiculous and the ridiculous 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 lean arsenio as well as showing up on Sunday 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 with his time machine in the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.549
 basements of the same building 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.520
 there is a Monday base that is helped 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.079
 absolutely two other characters 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.700
 wonderful September and October two 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.860
 guys that we will find called in various 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 ways also in the other September series 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.659
 pseudo genius robot builder e 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.759
 October obese by the Herculean force that it is 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.350
 it will also deserve the October corner 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.070
 comic curtain in which it shows that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 what can he do 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.379
 compared to a common mortal in essence 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.819
 the dull dawn princess Sunday that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.350
 looks annoyingly like 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.020
 princess aurora away 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 how his paranormal powers manage to 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.280
 pick up the waves of the pub over a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.740
 device designed from September for 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.870
 find out I'm cosmo peacock who can't 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.460
 do the normal bird no travels in the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.770
 time and takes the shape of objects 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 more disparate than the shoe of 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
 cinderella and newton's apple the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.800
 aladino lamp and so on 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.600
 however, the fights with are more amusing 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 the three evil ones who create a machine 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.640
 different for each battle while the two 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.380
 useless boys have a secret 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 gets from Sunday to turn into 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.120
 the act of age man 1 polimar with the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.010
 flute and so much is the useless the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.350
 boy in plain clothes so much becomes 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.240
 ganzo once transformed by itself though 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.580
 he cannot defeat later and so together 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.800
 grins Latin who would like to lay it down 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.200
 from the first episode they evoke a robot 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.510
 king star joining the key is a 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 padlock that does not recall at all 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.050
 no sexual reference 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.390
 the robot compares sometimes helped by a 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.640
 pegaso sagittarius defeats evil and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 the bet usually ends with a king 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840
 star who would like to save them by saying 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.740
 the legendary phrase I hate crime does not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.540
 who commits it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.160
 but the three eagles taking for i 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 soft bottoms come perpetually 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.470
 flamed the final the peacock cosmos after 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.420
 52 episodes back calendar comes 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.070
 captured since September that succeeds with the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.110
 strength to crown the young prince 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.900
 Saturday but right at the fateful moment 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.640
 the bird frees itself and goes to rest on 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.230
 princess the fake Sunday 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.030
 Coronation pro will cause a cataclysm 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.070
 and the kingdom between destroyed 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.480
 the epilogue on Sunday becomes queen 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.100
 rebuilds the realm 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.960
 the princess comes on Monday 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.390
 definitely defeated but finds 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.910
 true love with Count Don Giovanni 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.730
 another ridiculous character appeared half 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.100
 series and clever tina as a thrush understands 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.630
 later we do not know how many months that beppe e 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.430
 ato the age but they are the same person 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.260
 and sweethearts in love 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.210
 ergo morality is not among the most 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.040
 edifying, it's good to be good 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.140
 maybe you will win too but the world will 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.180
 will love more from you the choice is bad 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.430
 after all, don't tell me you preferred he 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.790
 man a skeletor because you just don't 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 I think
