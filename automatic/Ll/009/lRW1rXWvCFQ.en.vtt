impressive for the Game Boy era there's

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.840 
impressive for the Game Boy era there's
so<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.740> game<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.370> I<00:01:47.400> didn't<00:01:47.729> think

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
so much in that game that I didn't think

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
so much in that game that I didn't think
could<00:01:48.090> fit<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> Game<00:01:49.590> Boy<00:01:49.620> Color<00:01:50.159> because

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
could fit in the Game Boy Color because

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.000

enough<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> point<00:02:50.400> where<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.880> risky's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300

revenge soon after and risky's revenge
is<00:02:54.630> sort<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.560> bittersweet<00:02:55.980> one<00:02:56.610> for<00:02:56.819> me

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
is sort of a bittersweet one for me

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.120 
is sort of a bittersweet one for me
mainly<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.720> thought<00:02:58.440> there<00:02:58.650> was<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.830> lot

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
mainly because I thought there was a lot

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.039 
mainly because I thought there was a lot
more<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.850> first<00:03:00.120> Shantae<00:03:00.510> than<00:03:00.690> there<00:03:00.870> was

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
more to the first Shantae than there was

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.720 
more to the first Shantae than there was
in<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.500> game<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:01.830> mean<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.130> mechanics<00:03:02.610> were

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
in this game I mean the mechanics were

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.490 
in this game I mean the mechanics were
certainly<00:03:03.150> improved<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.019> magic<00:03:04.319> meter

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
certainly improved and the magic meter

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.440 
certainly improved and the magic meter
is<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.220> nice<00:03:05.370> touch<00:03:05.670> other

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
is actually a really nice touch other

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.380 
is actually a really nice touch other
than<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.840> though<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.920> firt<00:03:08.340> ii<00:03:09.000> shantae

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
than that though the firt ii shantae

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.449 
than that though the firt ii shantae
didn't<00:03:09.810> really<00:03:10.319> impress<00:03:10.799> me<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.100> much<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
didn't really impress me as much as the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.610 
didn't really impress me as much as the
first<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.900> maybe<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.140> lacking<00:03:13.319> some

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
first one maybe was lacking some

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.949 
first one maybe was lacking some
substance<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> game<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.390> wasn't

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
substance or like the game just wasn't

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.990 
substance or like the game just wasn't
as<00:03:16.110> large<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.769> mean<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.950> know<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.190> was<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> DSi

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
as large I mean I know it was a DSi

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.160 
as large I mean I know it was a DSi
where<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.600> game<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.100> being<00:03:20.610> said<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
revenge because there was a lot more to

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.970 
revenge because there was a lot more to
do<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.859> first<00:03:32.100> Shantae<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.880> was<00:03:33.030> $5

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
do in the first Shantae and that was $5

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
do in the first Shantae and that was $5
still<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.370> was<00:03:35.549> an<00:03:35.700> alright<00:03:35.850> game<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.480> mean<00:03:36.959> it

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
still it was an alright game I mean it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.470 
still it was an alright game I mean it
wasn't<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.920> grand<00:03:38.400> game<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.299> was

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
wasn't the grand game that I was

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.210 
wasn't the grand game that I was
expecting<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.079> compared<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> first

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
expecting like compared to the first

then<00:04:10.170> there's<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.470> gameplay<00:04:10.829> mechanics

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
then there's the gameplay mechanics

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.490 
then there's the gameplay mechanics
which<00:04:11.459> were<00:04:11.790> vastly<00:04:12.359> improved<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.019> mean<00:04:13.170> as

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
which were vastly improved I mean as

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.990 
which were vastly improved I mean as
much<00:04:13.680> as<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.190> transformations<00:04:14.850> from

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
much as I like the transformations from

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.270 
much as I like the transformations from
the<00:04:15.180> first<00:04:15.389> two<00:04:15.600> Shantae<00:04:16.079> games<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.859> pirate

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the first two Shantae games the pirate

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.699 
the first two Shantae games the pirate
weapons<00:04:17.639> in<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.060> one<00:04:18.329> really<00:04:19.079> improved<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
weapons in this one really improved the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.039 
weapons in this one really improved the
game<00:04:19.919> planets<00:04:20.340> sped<00:04:20.579> up<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.789> pace<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.389> that's

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
game planets sped up the pace and that's

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.240 
game planets sped up the pace and that's
on<00:04:22.260> top<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> improvements<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.160> they

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
on top of the improvements that they

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.540 
on top of the improvements that they
made<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.789> through<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.539> overall<00:04:24.900> game<00:04:25.200> such<00:04:25.500> as

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
made up through the overall game such as

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.950 
made up through the overall game such as
making<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.729> camera<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.539> bit<00:04:27.659> further

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
making the camera a little bit further

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.260 
making the camera a little bit further
away<00:04:28.260> from<00:04:28.289> Shantae<00:04:28.890> which<00:04:29.310> made<00:04:29.909> which

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
away from Shantae which made which

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.390 
away from Shantae which made which
allowed<00:04:30.539> us<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.720> look<00:04:31.169> for<00:04:31.500> things<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.950> work

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
allowed us to look for things that work

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.969 
allowed us to look for things that work
at<00:04:32.550> us<00:04:32.759> in<00:04:33.060> addition<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.050> pretty<00:04:34.710> much<00:04:34.830> the
