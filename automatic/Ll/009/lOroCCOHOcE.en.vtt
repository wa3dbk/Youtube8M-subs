felt like we made a lot of changes on
the<00:00:17.279> bike<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> same<00:00:18.779> time<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.230> know

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the bike but at the same time you know

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.990 
the bike but at the same time you know
you<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.890> don't<00:00:20.100> know<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.789> there

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
you really don't know if you get there

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.540 
you really don't know if you get there
the<00:00:21.390> season<00:00:21.840> wise<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.560> been<00:00:22.769> an<00:00:23.070> up-and-down

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the season wise it's been an up-and-down

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
the season wise it's been an up-and-down
year<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.350> overall<00:00:25.350> maybe<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
year but I think overall maybe the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.920 
year but I think overall maybe the
results<00:00:26.609> gonna<00:00:26.789> show<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> until<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.449> weekend

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
continuing for a since you know I felt

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.940 
continuing for a since you know I felt
like<00:01:13.240> we<00:01:13.479> got<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> suspension<00:01:14.050> better<00:01:14.410> it

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
like we got the suspension better it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.350 
like we got the suspension better it
wouldn't<00:01:15.190> matter<00:01:15.280> if<00:01:15.400> we<00:01:15.550> start<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.820> 19th<00:01:16.210> place

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
wouldn't matter if we start a 19th place

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.210 
wouldn't matter if we start a 19th place
we're<00:01:16.690> still<00:01:16.869> gonna<00:01:16.990> lose<00:01:17.080> so<00:01:17.410> we

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
we're still gonna lose so we

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.280 
we're still gonna lose so we
concentrated<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.910> that<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.390> obviously<00:01:20.140> it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
concentrated on that and obviously it

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.139 
concentrated on that and obviously it
