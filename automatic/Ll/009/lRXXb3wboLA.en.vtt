00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello everyone here with the rockies 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.700
 commenting on a new video so that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 the Spanish tactics the last time in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 the last comment I was giving you my 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.420
 opinion on the advantage of ghosts and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.339
 I thought it was dirty or not in this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.529
 call of duty in the previous heats 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.249
 that I tried and beats or the section of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.589
 comments 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.569
 today today Friday 11th measured all 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.069
 the comments that you left jce and how 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.019
 there is always diversity of opinions 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.210
 we will never agree on a 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.520
 same subject so to change a 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.620
 little for a change in this example of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.870
 use ghost and hard line I change it for 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.149
 light weight and hard line so you can see 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 that despite not wearing a ghost is 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.039
 also not simple but it is also 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.589
 possible to become a gameplay and a 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.449
 departure of more than 100 casualties more than anything 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.820
 if you play in a group it is much easier 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.870
 but if you play alone today it can complicate 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 a little more 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.289
 that's why I cut the first 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 part of the gameplay the first round 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.100
 better said because that 's what happens when 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.570
 you do not have ghost you play alone and you're 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 completely in the pre- responder 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.860
 running towards the enemy they kill you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.630
 a lot and it's completely 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820
 so for the gameplay so that the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.280
 gameplay is more entertaining and for not 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.400
 be seeing the mouse dying to rubÃ©n 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.900
 in this case over again because it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.700
 I cut the first part I hope 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.290
 that you do not mind because the second 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.690
 part the most entertaining of all is 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.729
 where there is almost a nuclear streak 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.190
 but bring some day in some future 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.410
 a nuclear streak with a game of more 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 of 100 casualties that we have but have already 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.490
 seen too much on other channels so 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 I'm not going to bring it in this because I 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.900
 I wanted to tell you in a while and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.910
 commented on these as they are good not 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.979
 how are they how to get rid of the gusts 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.890
 nuclear what are the best gusts 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.690
 the best advantages the best forms 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 to move with the slime to get this 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.740
 nuclear streak because the title that you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140
 They give in exchange is pretty handsome the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.540
 true so good going on to talk 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.340
 of the theme in general or the specific topic 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.229
 let's talk I'm going to talk 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.380
 rather in this example and comment 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.970
 is the best class for russia because I 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
 I said a while ago 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.619
 a couple of months ago I said that in this 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.780
 black ops 2 in this call of duty is very 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.590
 difficult to fight more than anything for the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.000
 amount of time 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.739
 for the amount of claims by the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.269
 amount of electrics shocked 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 glued hours et cetera etcetera by the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.450
 amount of primary grenades and 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.430
 secondaries that are often used 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.860
 because I thought that in this call of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.860
 duty and optionally he chooses 10 or peak 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.290
 have as it is said in English nobody goes to 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.970
 use electric due to using grenades 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.860
 primary and secondary better said 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.709
 because they were going to take advantage to be 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.890
 accessories to get advantages for 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.200
 put on another style of things but it looked 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.640
 that it was not like that so I said from the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 principle that was completely 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.380
 necessary to announce successfully in the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.349
 white whistles good echalecu bulletproof 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.700
 get the most practical because if it was not 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.980
 impossible to make a good temple 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.299
 impossible to make a good game and what 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 only you were going to do was scream 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.560
 resist screaming that they were basically what 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.200
 what I did and what I did rubÃ©n because 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.819
 the only one that was put in the channel is that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.090
 advantage not that combination of 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.890
 I went advantages and for that reason because it 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.019
 he did not scream as much as other 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.329
 people due to the electricity and 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.860
 Sometimes I feel that kind of thing because in 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.140
 this call of duty happens the same with the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.300
 modern warfare2 the scavenger 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.830
 etc in both primary sisters and 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.500
 secondary that is something that also 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.720
 happened in the black ops 1 but I do not know 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 recharged the playmore or another type of 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.280
 things that are super cited I have not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.990
 fixed still if the boys or the pepos 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.640
 I do not know what you call also 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.430
 replenish in this call of duty or not 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.560
 but good thing is that the kind of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.690
 always the default class for 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.670
 wrestlers has been the lightweight and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.980
 the marathon or extreme conditioning 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.200
 in this case because that's the way 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.610
 much more of course and it's something that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.890
 I recommend that you put yourself because the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.420
 people already use a lot less what 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.610
 is being times a lot less 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.709
 what we have I do not know what kind of 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.690
 game what kind of mode of Uruguay 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.580
 you but in land war and the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.769
 people use them a lot less besides 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.260
 Lass Betis can be said to be 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.060
 they listen well and especially if it 's only if 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.410
 no people your time talking as 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.360
 they listen quite well and it gives time 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.580
 duck or lie down I do not know what it is 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.200
 you I bend down so if you want 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.820
 try this class and let me know the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.980
 next comments how are you? 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
 because it has always been the best 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.060
 class for russia and of course the east 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.970
 product is also because if not 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.280
 you carry secondary if you go only 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.230
 The truth is that an authentic 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.880
 outrageously I recommend that you put 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.620
 this class because it's super fun 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.450
 especially with their rifles and with 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.720
 shotguns not so much with snipers 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.570
 not so much with assault rifles maybe 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.010
 with light and but if you add to that the 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.260
 dexterity the truth is that it is a 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.940
 very very good combination to run if 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.710
 we care that they kill you as it happens 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.810
 us but we care nothing that we 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.470
 actually kill this game ends with 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.180
 a 109 to 12 and 12 deaths for some what 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.430
 they consider many deaths for us 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.170
 it does not seem to us that the more 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.030
 death is not better but the more 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.650
 death means that we have less 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.750
 changed so nothing I hope you have 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.100
 enjoyed that you enjoyed this 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.840
 example and see you in the next 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.840
 a greeting see you later and goodbye
