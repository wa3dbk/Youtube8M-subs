00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
features of this deck that we've talked

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.410 
features of this deck that we've talked
about<00:00:16.650> recently<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.430> our<00:00:17.460> podcast<00:00:17.670> that's

about recently on our podcast that's
right<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> common<00:00:20.070> points<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
right one of the common points of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.420 
right one of the common points of
failure<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.720> deck<00:00:21.960> over<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> long<00:00:22.859> term<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
failure in a deck over a long term is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.759 
failure in a deck over a long term is
where<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> double<00:00:24.689> beam<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> triple

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
where you have a double beam or a triple

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
where you have a double beam or a triple
beam<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> double<00:00:27.180> joist

beam or a double joist

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.849 
beam or a double joist
so<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> help<00:00:28.670> mitigate<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.260> over<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
so to help mitigate that over the top of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.910 
so to help mitigate that over the top of
every<00:00:32.250> double<00:00:32.969> beam<00:00:33.149> or<00:00:33.360> double<00:00:33.630> joist<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.230> have

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
every double beam or double joist I have

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.880 
every double beam or double joist I have

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
beam one of the features my wife likes

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.040 
beam one of the features my wife likes
is<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.360> Boulder

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is this Boulder

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.580 
is this Boulder
we<00:00:43.860> put<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.510> compensate<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.379> uneven

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we put that in to compensate for uneven

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.240 
we put that in to compensate for uneven
grade<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> last<00:00:48.000> step<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.010> makes<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> nice

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
grade at the last step and makes a nice

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
grade at the last step and makes a nice
landing<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.899> lighting<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.140> decided

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
landing so for the lighting we decided

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.000 
landing so for the lighting we decided
to<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.890> low<00:00:56.190> voltage<00:00:56.699> lighting<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> wire

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to do low voltage lighting so the wire

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.229 
to do low voltage lighting so the wire
was<00:00:59.250> hidden<00:00:59.489> up<00:01:00.170> below<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> top<00:01:02.309> rail<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
was hidden up below this top rail in a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.320 
was hidden up below this top rail in a
groove<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:06.020> top<00:01:07.020> rail<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> guardrail

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
groove in the top rail of the guardrail

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.730 
groove in the top rail of the guardrail
so<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.570> somewhat<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.020> hidden<00:01:10.260> fastener

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so for somewhat of a hidden fastener

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
so for somewhat of a hidden fastener
what<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> chose<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.850> face<00:01:12.150> screw<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
what I chose to do was face screw the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.039 
what I chose to do was face screw the
board's<00:01:13.470> recess<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.610> screw<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.810> cover

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
board's recess the screw and then cover

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.380 
board's recess the screw and then cover
the<00:01:16.229> screw<00:01:16.470> head<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.890> wooden<00:01:17.220> plugs<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the screw head with wooden plugs and you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
the screw head with wooden plugs and you
can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.720> how<00:01:18.869> some<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.320> blend<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> pretty

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
can see how some of them blend in pretty

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
can see how some of them blend in pretty
well<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> boards<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.390> them

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
well with the boards some of them

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.640 
well with the boards some of them
provide<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.960> interesting<00:01:22.229> contrast<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> Brian

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
provide an interesting contrast so Brian

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.499 
provide an interesting contrast so Brian
I<00:01:25.830> noticed<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.369> aluminum<00:01:26.820> balusters<00:01:27.330> as

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I noticed you have aluminum balusters as

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
I noticed you have aluminum balusters as
well<00:01:27.689> yeah<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> chose<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.920> aluminum

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
well yeah I chose to do aluminum

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
well yeah I chose to do aluminum
balancers<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.060> were<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.450> little<00:01:30.780> less

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
balancers they were a little less

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
balancers they were a little less
expensive<00:01:31.200> than<00:01:31.650> IPE<00:01:32.100> balusters<00:01:32.700> they

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
expensive than IPE balusters they

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
expensive than IPE balusters they
provide<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> nice<00:01:33.840> look<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:35.100> came<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490

provide a nice look and they came with a
nice<00:01:36.119> plastic<00:01:36.840> connector<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> made<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
nice plastic connector that made it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.319 
nice plastic connector that made it
really<00:01:37.920> easy<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.490> install<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> very

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
really easy to install and that's a very

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.730 
really easy to install and that's a very
important<00:01:39.720> feature<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.200> pressure-treated

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
important feature on pressure-treated

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
important feature on pressure-treated
lumber<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.820> use<00:01:41.970> those<00:01:42.210> plastic<00:01:42.479> connectors

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
lumber to use those plastic connectors

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
lumber to use those plastic connectors
alright<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.329> any
