experiment with desiccated liver that
was<00:02:19.670> our<00:02:20.510> only<00:02:20.870> 20<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.470> these<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.460> wolf<00:02:22.640> spent

over there with huge really people like
a<00:02:26.120> stop<00:02:26.420> sign<00:02:27.250> back<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.670> looks<00:02:28.850> like<00:02:29.150> I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
a stop sign back but it looks like I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
a stop sign back but it looks like I
remember<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> would<00:02:30.860> say

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.350

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
my hat's off person with 27 mm you know

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.830 
my hat's off person with 27 mm you know
swallowing<00:02:41.360> water<00:02:43.330> which<00:02:44.330> they<00:02:44.540> wanted

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
swallowing water which they wanted

00:02:44.840 --> 00:03:34.780 
swallowing water which they wanted
timely<00:02:45.379> yeah<00:02:45.890> about<00:02:48.280> that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:05:02.270 

yes

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:16.439 

the<00:05:03.280> holder<00:05:03.930> stopped<00:05:14.880> more<00:05:15.880> protein<00:05:16.330> you

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
the holder stopped more protein you

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:59.969 
the holder stopped more protein you
taking<00:05:16.990> the

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.589 

so<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.249> all<00:06:01.369> that<00:06:01.639> was<00:06:01.969> in<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.449> division

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
so that all that was in the division

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.199 
so that all that was in the division
side<00:06:05.469> there's<00:06:06.469> the<00:06:06.680> very<00:06:06.860> most<00:06:07.249> logical<00:06:07.999> to

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:08.209 
side there's the very most logical to

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:11.079 
side there's the very most logical to
sort<00:06:08.479> of<00:06:08.990> scenario<00:06:09.349> I<00:06:09.770> mean<00:06:09.949> when<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.550> met<00:06:10.789> Paul

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
sort of scenario I mean when I met Paul

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:18.279 
sort of scenario I mean when I met Paul
vow<00:06:14.889> for<00:06:15.889> economic<00:06:16.550> support<00:06:17.059> was<00:06:17.839> when<00:06:18.050> it's
