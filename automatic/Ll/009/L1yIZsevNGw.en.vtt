00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.960 

last<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.589> talked<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.550> head<00:00:02.760> in

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
last video I talked about the head in

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.730 
last video I talked about the head in
general<00:00:03.360> now<00:00:04.049> we're<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> start<00:00:04.470> tearing

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
general now we're going to start tearing

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.800 
general now we're going to start tearing
it<00:00:04.920> down<00:00:04.950> by<00:00:05.609> taking<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.060> valve<00:00:06.270> springs<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
it down by taking the valve springs and

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.440 
it down by taking the valve springs and
the<00:00:06.839> valves<00:00:07.200> out<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:08.970> is

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
the valves out and how you do that is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.440 
the valves out and how you do that is
you<00:00:09.870> use<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.139> tool<00:00:10.710> like<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> valve

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you use a tool like this this is a valve

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.570 
you use a tool like this this is a valve
spring<00:00:12.719> compressor<00:00:13.009> so<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
spring compressor so you can get the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.870 
spring compressor so you can get the
valve<00:00:14.790> spring<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.379> valve<00:00:16.560> keepers<00:00:17.010> out<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
valve spring the valve keepers out and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.290 
valve spring the valve keepers out and
then<00:00:18.359> pull<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> spring<00:00:18.840> off<00:00:19.820> I'm<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> do

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
then pull the spring off I'm going to do

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
then pull the spring off I'm going to do
it<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.500> head<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.100> still<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.060> car<00:00:25.490> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it as if this head was still on a car so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.290 
it as if this head was still on a car so
you<00:00:26.550> would<00:00:26.939> require<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.630> these<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
you would require one of these and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.580 
you would require one of these and
something<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.599> into<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.109> spark<00:00:31.380> plug

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
something to put into the spark plug

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.450 
something to put into the spark plug
hole<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> could<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.940> air<00:00:34.460> compressed

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
hole so you could have air compressed

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
hole so you could have air compressed
into<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> chamber<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> valves<00:00:37.260> don't

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
into the chamber so the valves don't

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.660 
into the chamber so the valves don't
fall<00:00:37.860> into<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.520> chamber<00:00:43.040> if<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
fall into the chamber if this was on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.470 
fall into the chamber if this was on
your<00:00:44.820> car<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> first<00:00:45.450> step<00:00:45.750> would<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
your car the first step would be is to

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.439 
your car the first step would be is to
take<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> rocker<00:00:48.780> arms<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.180> then<00:00:51.180> with

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
take the rocker arms off and then with

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
take the rocker arms off and then with
these<00:00:51.660> being<00:00:52.590> stationary<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> because

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
these being stationary like this because

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.529 
these being stationary like this because
they'd<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.879> closed

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
they'd be closed

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.770 
they'd be closed
you<00:00:55.020> guys<00:00:55.170> thick<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.510> little<00:00:57.510> tool<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you guys thick then a little tool that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.819 
you guys thick then a little tool that
screws<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.510> spark<00:01:00.510> plug<00:01:00.690> hole<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.739> then

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
screws into the spark plug hole and then

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.350 
screws into the spark plug hole and then
you'd<00:01:01.980> run<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> compressed<00:01:03.000> air<00:01:03.210> line<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.769> and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
you'd run a compressed air line in and

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
you'd run a compressed air line in and
compressed<00:01:06.360> air<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.960> holding<00:01:07.770> these

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
compressed air would be holding these

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
compressed air would be holding these
valves<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
valves up so when you take this off this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:02:00.510 
valves up so when you take this off this
doesn't<00:01:10.770> fall<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.439> let's<00:01:13.439> start

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.999 

there's<00:02:01.060> your<00:02:01.270> keepers

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:24.050 

there's<00:02:09.580> your<00:02:09.759> bow<00:02:09.879> spring<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.980> retainer

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.030 

I'm<00:02:24.630> unscrewing<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.800> how<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
I'm unscrewing it so you can see how the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.850 
I'm unscrewing it so you can see how the
system<00:02:26.489> works

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
system works

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
system works
an<00:02:28.860> installation<00:02:29.280> would<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.000> Reverse<00:02:30.330> of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
an installation would be in Reverse of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.760 
an installation would be in Reverse of
how<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.810> taking<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.260> off

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:56.900 

I'm<00:02:36.460> just<00:02:36.640> gonna<00:02:36.730> go<00:02:36.910> right<00:02:37.030> down<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.240> line

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.250 

and<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.150> see<00:02:58.330> now<00:02:58.480> all<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.840> valve

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
and you can see now all the valve

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.810 
and you can see now all the valve
springs<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.830> out<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:03.040> keep<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.610> valve

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
springs are out to keep the valve

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.450 
springs are out to keep the valve
springs<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.750> retainers<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.680> keepers

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
springs and the retainers the keepers

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.340 
springs and the retainers the keepers
and<00:03:06.790> also<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.210> valves<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.870> made<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.170> little

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
and also the valves I made this little

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.880 
and also the valves I made this little
cardboard<00:03:08.920> cutout<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:11.080> labels<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.740> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
cardboard cutout that labels like the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.910 
cardboard cutout that labels like the
engine<00:03:12.310> each<00:03:13.060> cylinder<00:03:13.540> that's<00:03:14.350> that's<00:03:14.590> front

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
engine each cylinder that's that's front

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.770 
engine each cylinder that's that's front
just<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.670> front<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> engine<00:03:16.240> is<00:03:16.570> up

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
just like the front of the engine is up

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.230 
just like the front of the engine is up
here<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:19.840> go<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.350> order<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.970> reuse

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
here and they go in order if you reuse

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.270 
here and they go in order if you reuse
them<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:23.200> have<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.530> put<00:03:23.710> them<00:03:23.770> in<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:23.980> exact

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
them you have to put them in the exact

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.760 
them you have to put them in the exact
same<00:03:24.490> place<00:03:24.700> otherwise<00:03:25.470> failures<00:03:26.470> could

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
same place otherwise failures could

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:37.290 
same place otherwise failures could
happen<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.510> let's<00:03:29.080> now<00:03:29.470> pull<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.830> valves<00:03:30.250> out

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.470 

there's<00:03:37.840> an<00:03:38.050> intake<00:03:38.350> valve<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:39.490> go<00:03:40.300> with

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
there's an intake valve will go with

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.630 
there's an intake valve will go with
identifying<00:03:41.140> what<00:03:41.440> they<00:03:41.560> look<00:03:41.770> like<00:03:41.800> later

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
identifying what they look like later

00:03:42.640 --> 00:04:15.910 
identifying what they look like later
let's<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:43.600> pull<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.960> all<00:03:44.050> out

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.310 

I<00:04:16.630> can<00:04:17.630> see<00:04:17.780> they're<00:04:17.930> all<00:04:18.109> out<00:04:19.480> as<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:21.109> see

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
I can see they're all out as you can see

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.020 
I can see they're all out as you can see
here<00:04:21.650> they're<00:04:21.889> all<00:04:22.040> laid<00:04:22.250> out<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.790> order
