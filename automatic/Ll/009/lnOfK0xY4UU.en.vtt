00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.050
 These apps will cost you something again 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.040
 First, we have ten kate raw here 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.920

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.020
 week program with three days each 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.800
 Week after that I plan to finish 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.750
 ten kilometers on the track can run that 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.140
 whole is very very pretty graphically 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.360
 prepared and you can then also here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.740
 the respective steps 25 minutes warm up 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.170
 then a minute 15 15 minutes 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 go and so on and so forth arises 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.259
 So very good instructions and then 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.230
 in the end, you get to ten 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.230
 kilometer if you have this program 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.180
 strict follows so pro for the people 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010
 want to get a bit fitter under 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.709
 you have to slim down because both yes 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.319
 also summertime and busy time 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.750

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.210
 found 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.190
