the<00:03:11.500> Ron<00:03:11.680> slide<00:03:13.500> doesn't<00:03:14.500> offer<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.860> lot<00:03:15.099> of

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
the Ron slide doesn't offer a lot of

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.270 
the Ron slide doesn't offer a lot of
feedback<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:16.930> real<00:03:17.409> open<00:03:17.739> sound<00:03:18.010> and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
feedback so it's real open sound and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.309 
feedback so it's real open sound and
there's<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.700> lot<00:03:18.879> of<00:03:18.970> room<00:03:19.120> on<00:03:19.239> each<00:03:19.390> slot<00:03:19.720> so

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
there's a lot of room on each slot so

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.190 
there's a lot of room on each slot so
you<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.769> really<00:03:21.340> change<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.019> pitch<00:03:23.019> on

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200

fairly<00:04:26.950> open<00:04:27.340> I'll<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.120> test<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.450> upper
