00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 available and minerals then all 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 metabolic activities tells us one of di 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570
 have more attention because it is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.309
 always in activity this plant here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.180
 because we continue to insist 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 vote as late as possible look for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
 push the prunings further 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 possible almost close to the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 miniature of the flowering proper for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 allow greater balance 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:46.829
 but the times are metabolic to the plant 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:49.559
 and therefore we undoubtedly seek 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.780
 not to be afraid to get there too 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.969
 further on this is what we are taught 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.370
 also the experience of knocking that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.680
 producer he may wish to all in all 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 it will be shared a bit with everyone though 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.519
 go to vote no but obviously when 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 it was there until the end while iger prof 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.810
 at the beginning of flowering you will have 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.100
 surely the plants with more lecture 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 yes because it is a de facto album of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 physiological balance in the sense that if 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.340
 we sell and anticipate the flow too much 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 the plant on the system we say its 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.220
 intelligence moves it over vegetation 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.110
 that is about activating those gems 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.750
 adventitives that are inside the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.750
 cutting and then pushing the plant a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.720
 produce is vegetation to produce wood 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.789
 while if we let him vent 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 at the beginning of the vegetative growth e 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.409
 we are going to remove the wood when she is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.470
 has already already transformed its business 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.770
 from vegetative growth to let's say 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.929
 pre- flowering activity opens flower 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.409
 then at this point the plant succeeds in 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.030
 better manage the productive activity that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.679
 not the vegetative one 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.479
 moreover we are most likely 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.429
 if we are good at holding then 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.170
 balance the plant to have less 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.510
 suckers and less vegetation is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.489
 let's call it so useless that 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.060
 basically we're here for 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.010
 to prune to produce not to prune a 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.110
 beautiful by law another speech is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.400
 so here's why it's important for the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.920
 present that it is an evergreen plant 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.100
 that's why frost damage is 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 explosions are purposes you see here 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.650
 it's just explosions and exclusions a 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.620
 level of the blessing system 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.079
 in the olive tree kellock sile but that the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.579
 outermost part 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.850
 this is why it is also important there 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.980
 fertilizers for example of potassium 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.650
 they are important because they thicken the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.170
 the book is the most external part of the book 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.910
 is the outermost part of the cortex e 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 therefore they reduce and as if we put 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.100
 in a glass bottle filled with water 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.640
 and to put in the freezer a cloth of 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.010
 wool we help you reduce capacity 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.620
 freezing is important to keep 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.540
 present these things then it is starting from 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.600
 low the root system of the olive tree yes 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.870
 divide into two species 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.470
 ic the first ones that develop and are 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.600
 those woody that anchor and 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.720
 then later where there are some 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 these are hyperplasia and they are called 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.510
 ova from just below these develop 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.330
 the roots are the secondary ones that are 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.940
 axis to the assimilation of the substance 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.010
 mineral which are the cuttings therefore 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.200
 the root system of the olive tree that 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.140
 important for the assimilation of 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.140
 substance is high and high is not low
