 First of all , let's aim at this bar pattern of Code Geass in the lower left reel . 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:57.050
 It's a child, so it slips in the case of watermelon cherries 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 And I know right design from concrete number in the case, but of watermelon Cherry

 There are watermelon and cherries on the upper and lower sides of the design of the sheet , so I dropped it here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.290

 It rushed into Black Lily of ar t 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.810
 This ant has 40 games 1 set 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.830
 The net increase is about 1.5 times 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.160
 Because expectations for the addition of AAR tea will change depending on the background, this is also necessary 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.160
 Please note 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.280

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.490
 It is confirmed 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:58.270
 Well security because the quiet was aligned'm difference ant also deterministic but 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:03.930

 Yes, it's written here as loop system instruction 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.259
 During this loop , 80% of AR T will continue at 90% 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.350
 Its great c 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:34.389
