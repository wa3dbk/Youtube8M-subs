00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.020
 attention the following video contains 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.850
 spoilers and the final fantasy 7 the saga 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.179
 mario bros the saga the legend of zelda 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.410
 portal and the saga 'resident evil' if 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.269
 you have lived in an art bubble 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.559
 all this time and you do not know any 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.539
 of these five things 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.640
 close the video and be happy 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.070
 by spoiler we understand a gutted 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 argue a revelation of history 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.939
 gift detail of the argument that can 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.489
 spoil or not the playable experience 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.219
 can be applied to the cinema to literature 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.379
 to almost any art that is narrative 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.239
 and therefore video games are not 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.550
 star level nonetheless there are some 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.309
 spoilers that are so common that they are so 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.350
 popular that I really do not think they are 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.110
 such thing and about this dance this video 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.680
 chosen 5 in particular and nothing we are going to 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.680
 start with them 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.489
 first cell is not the uncle of the sword 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.930
 who has dressed in green worth that link is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 to say calmly with that put the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 legend of zelda you will not control the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.159
 princess zelda but to an uncle who 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.229
 flame link feel the spoiler guys 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.850
 I feel that the legend is not from her 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 Although there was a starring game 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 for the princess made for cd and that was 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.159
 the effect but in the end I just wanted 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.159
 point to this I'm sorry I feel after 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.310
 in second place mario bros can be 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 fighting against bauser continuously that 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 no matter when you get to the castle 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.450
 princess peach is going to be somewhere else 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.860
 will not be in that castle I'm sorry 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.500
 you have to try again a lot 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.690
 this hack has really been repeated 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.490
 tirelessly not only the 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.530
 franchise mario bros but also 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 independent games like price so 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.100
 I do not think it's a spoiler to say that a 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.320
 Although you do everything you want 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.770
 with mario you will not find a pitch in 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.770
 the castle just in case 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.770
 forgives 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.290
 the cake is a light the cake is a lie 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.030
 that's has popularized globally since 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.950
 the exit of the first portal has been 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.950
 become a meme in itself there 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.900
 t-shirts there are a lot of pictures in 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.450
 Internet that talk about this has been 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.800
 recreated in games like minecraft said 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.320
 an achievement that is called is not a lie 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.120
 and that is to cook a cake in 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.580
 end basically of cake and room is the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.530
 summary of what goes portal is to say 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.420
 throughout the game an intelligence 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.950
 officer called klados talks to you about a 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.430
 cake that you will find before or 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 then the phrase says it all and spoiler 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.570
 you will not enjoy less in the game 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.209
 for knowing this the game is great with 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.200
 which you know this or not is 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.660
 totally indifferent 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.790
 with resident and bold capcom I do not believe but 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.629
 if it solidifies the bases of survival 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.370
 hole 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.989
 and the first resident and flew showed us 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.849
 to a character called a western that 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.000
 it was in theory on our side but 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.790
 finally it was revealed as bad I think 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.989
 that is not a spoiler because in all 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.340
 subsequent deliveries we have seen that 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.040
 wesker is a son of a bitch is an uncle who 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.890
 He is very crazy and we were with a whore 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.970
 sprinkler is the bad guy in the franchise 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.860
 I hope it's not a spoiler for 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.890
 nobody who has played anything more than the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.819
 first resident equal but just in case 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.400
 justin case 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.959
 if someone recovers now I deserved 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.760
 ball after worked to the later 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.620
 and is surprised that websites that is bad 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.420
 Well, I do not think it's a later 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.280
 and finally we came to him who has 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.340
 made this video that is the subject of 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.980
 aeris if a edis dies at the end of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480
 first cd sephiroth or something with the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.970
 sephiroth's appearance nailed the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.190
 back of the torso and kills it and really 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.170
 I wonder if something happened 18 years ago 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.170
 years something that marked a whole 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.019
 generation to my generation is really 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.269
 a spoiler today that is is like 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.010
 to say that the titanic sinks is like 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.659
 that of jacques that was in the table 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.030
 by itself or to fit but it would have 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.340
 sunk or like saying that the parents of 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.260
 batman die is worth something that we repeat 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.120
 continuously percent in all 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.069
 fucking video games including the batman 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.959
 arkham light it seems that they are not going to 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.459
 let go and at the end they put the whore 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.680
 scene of batman's parents being 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
 killed and I hope that saying this does not 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.849
 be another spoiler because in the end we have 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.049
 seen in movies and series in comics and 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.220
 sure that even the batman cereals 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.200
 he tells you that the parents were 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.090
 killed at the exit of a theater in 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.590
 end issue of aeris I do not think that in a 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.390
 context as it is an end video 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.979
 fantasy memories people talk between 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.289
 yes about the franchise talking about 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.660
 what time have they been marked to reveal this 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.160
 be no spoiler 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.020
 and therefore with this video I wanted 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.250
 remove a little iron to the matter is not 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.900
 I like that they distribute me the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.220
 things is not worth going to the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.360
 internet researching what 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.460
 character will die in the next 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.450
 chapter of game of thrones is not that I 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.740
 like the spoilers 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.850
 in fact the repudiation quite the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.710
 trailers that put us in the movies 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.210
 counting the whole movie in the most 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.610
 recent action terminator genesis that 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.110
 they tell you the key spin of the movie 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.060
 thank goodness it is crap and in 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.680
 not the same but I want to say it 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.240
 guys is that spoilers like those that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.530
 I have commented right now they are not going to 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.730
 spoil the experience of playing 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.470
 no video game 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.150
 it does not matter if you know that pitch is not enough 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.680
 Castle gives the city like the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.660
 link is not in the title of the saga 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.310
 legend of zelda gives the same as you know 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.900
 that wesker batres in hoops because the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 story of the first fresh and ball is 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.420
 series b pulling to series z is an excuse 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.940
 very bad for mechanical development 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.470
 very good and it does not matter if you know that 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.420
 you have died because that is not the key 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.550
 of final fantasy 7 a eris is a 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.130
 mechanism for the story to advance and 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.530
 it is not the ultimate goal of what he wanted 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.790
 tell people about effort so why 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.860
 Please have a little head 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.650
 let's stop complaining because if 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.970
 of things that do not make any sense and 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.169
 enjoy video games in your 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.930
 totality not only 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.699
 based on a specific fact of the 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.110
 story that maybe if it's true you can 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.430
 have been well discover you 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.779
 but it is that in the same way that 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.669
 in the real world we know with shabaab the 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.080
 side in phases I swim that the titanic 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.840
 sank that Spain won against Germany 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.240
 that the world cup I think they really are 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.159
 things that are very very prays lives and that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.469
 therefore they should not raise many 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.180
 Finally I hope you liked the 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.099
 video in the case like program rivas yes 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.110
 you did not like it and I've blown you some 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.939
 very important fact as dislike by 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.889
 down, although I did warn the 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.629
 principle that you had oilers and for 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.460
 true one more thing do not go to the 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:03.650
 comments to spur people 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.539
 about things that do not have to know that 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.749
 we know each other come to the next 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.749
 video
