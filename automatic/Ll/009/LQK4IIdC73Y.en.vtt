bit more than what i'd like to pay
personally<00:05:31.670> but<00:05:32.670> you<00:05:32.730> know<00:05:33.110> $33<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.410> kind

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
personally but you know $33 is it kind

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.970 
personally but you know $33 is it kind
of<00:05:34.590> completely<00:05:35.010> break<00:05:35.670> the<00:05:35.790> bank<00:05:36.890> so<00:05:37.890> i'm

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
of completely break the bank so i'm

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.680 
of completely break the bank so i'm
going<00:05:38.070> to<00:05:38.130> give<00:05:38.280> them<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.730> be<00:05:39.350> on<00:05:41.360> price<00:05:42.360> i<00:05:42.600> do

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
going to give them a be on price i do

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.970 
going to give them a be on price i do
think<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.080> they<00:05:43.230> could<00:05:43.290> probably<00:05:43.590> lower<00:05:43.830> the
