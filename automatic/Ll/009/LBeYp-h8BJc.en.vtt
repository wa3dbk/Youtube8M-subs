and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.579> can't<00:02:07.850> actually<00:02:08.239> say<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.170> am<00:02:09.319> connecting

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
and I can't actually say I am connecting

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.190 
and I can't actually say I am connecting
with<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> road<00:02:10.190> with<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.550> steering<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.989> does

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
with the road with the steering it does

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.009 
with the road with the steering it does
feel<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> bit<00:02:12.530> anesthetized<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.730> I'm<00:02:14.019> more

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
feel a bit anesthetized and I'm more

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.979 
feel a bit anesthetized and I'm more
connecting<00:02:15.650> with<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> actual<00:02:16.989> power

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
connecting with the actual power

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.710 
connecting with the actual power
steering<00:02:19.120> equipment<00:02:20.120> rather<00:02:20.360> than<00:02:20.630> the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
steering equipment rather than the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.860 
steering equipment rather than the
actual<00:02:21.019> road<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.580> there<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.880> big<00:02:23.330> old<00:02:23.599> lag

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
actual road and there is a big old lag

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.850 
actual road and there is a big old lag
in<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> steering<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.010> we've<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.400> got<00:02:25.700> some

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
in the steering so we've really got some

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.229 
in the steering so we've really got some
issues<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.130> steering<00:02:28.430> here<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.120> that's

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
issues with the steering here and that's

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.479 
issues with the steering here and that's
this<00:02:29.330> car<00:02:29.600> hasn't<00:02:29.840> even<00:02:29.989> done<00:02:30.230> 30,000<00:02:31.010> miles<00:02:31.250> I

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
this car hasn't even done 30,000 miles I

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.880 
this car hasn't even done 30,000 miles I
doubt<00:02:31.730> very<00:02:31.760> much<00:02:32.269> it's<00:02:32.510> got<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.660> warm<00:02:32.989> steering

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
doubt very much it's got a warm steering

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.729 
doubt very much it's got a warm steering
box<00:02:34.160> or<00:02:34.430> warm<00:02:34.700> bushes<00:02:35.269> so<00:02:35.540> there's<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.440> lot<00:02:36.620> of

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
box or warm bushes so there's a lot of

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.380 
box or warm bushes so there's a lot of
that<00:02:36.860> going<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.459> which<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:37.850> don't<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that going on which we don't like and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.580 
that going on which we don't like and
really<00:02:41.390> at<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> end<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.080> day<00:02:42.230> for<00:02:42.290> thing

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
really at the end of the day for thing

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.320 
really at the end of the day for thing
about<00:02:42.769> buying<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> second-hand<00:02:43.940> that's

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
about buying on the second-hand that's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.880 
about buying on the second-hand that's
the<00:02:44.420> first<00:02:44.720> place<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.080> want<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.500> go<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.769> look

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
the first place you want to go and look

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.729 
the first place you want to go and look
at<00:02:46.130> because<00:02:46.519> if<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:46.819> like<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.560> car<00:02:48.560> you

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
at because if it's like that on car you

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.610 
at because if it's like that on car you
want<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.040> buy<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.250> want<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.670> walk<00:02:49.819> away<00:02:50.030> or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
want to buy you want to walk away or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.270 
want to buy you want to walk away or
renegotiate<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.799> price<00:02:52.930> now<00:02:53.930> that's<00:02:54.830> going<00:02:55.130> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
renegotiate the price now that's going a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.039 
renegotiate the price now that's going a
bit<00:02:55.400> faster<00:02:55.970> now<00:02:56.000> if<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.480> give<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> bit<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:56.989> a

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
bit faster now if I give it a bit of a

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.220 
bit faster now if I give it a bit of a
wiggle

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.440 

you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.129> for<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.459> big<00:03:01.610> old<00:03:01.819> car<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.269> doesn't

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
you know for a big old car it doesn't

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.210 
you know for a big old car it doesn't
both<00:03:02.750> around<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.409> much<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:04.069> actually

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
both around that much it's actually

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.990 
both around that much it's actually
quite<00:03:04.610> stable

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
quite stable

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.330 
quite stable
and<00:03:07.120> there's<00:03:07.810> not<00:03:07.930> many<00:03:08.080> vehicles<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:09.010> size

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and there's not many vehicles this size

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.820 
and there's not many vehicles this size
that<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:11.020> would<00:03:11.290> be<00:03:11.500> comfortable<00:03:13.680> swerving<00:03:14.680> at

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
that I would be comfortable swerving at

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.860 
that I would be comfortable swerving at
high<00:03:14.980> speed<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.330> one<00:03:16.570> would

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
high speed and I think this one would

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.100 
high speed and I think this one would
actually<00:03:16.900> be<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.470> easier<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.160> handle<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.930> a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
actually be a lot easier to handle in a

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.440 
actually be a lot easier to handle in a
situation<00:03:20.740> like<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.490> say<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:21.910> example

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
situation like that and say for example

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.040 
situation like that and say for example
a<00:03:22.690> Range<00:03:23.530> Rover

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
a Range Rover

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.190 
a Range Rover
or<00:03:25.470> maybe<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.890> land<00:03:26.190> program<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.810> very

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
or maybe a land program it is very very

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.440 
or maybe a land program it is very very
quiet<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.040> bit<00:03:29.190> noisy<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.730> must<00:03:29.970> admit<00:03:30.180> but

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
quiet it's a bit noisy I must admit but

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.030 
quiet it's a bit noisy I must admit but
it's<00:03:30.510> not<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:30.870> much<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.200> engine<00:03:31.530> noise<00:03:31.710> it's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it's not so much the engine noise it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.440 
it's not so much the engine noise it's
more<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.340> shape<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> car<00:03:32.970> cutting

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
more the shape of the car cutting

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.620 
more the shape of the car cutting
through<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> air<00:03:35.150> but<00:03:36.150> I'd<00:03:36.300> be<00:03:36.420> quite<00:03:36.570> happy

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
through the air but I'd be quite happy

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.450 
through the air but I'd be quite happy
to<00:03:36.990> drive<00:03:37.230> across<00:03:37.470> country<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.130> car

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
to say the the seats as well look like

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.460 
to say the the seats as well look like
it<00:04:05.700> looks<00:04:05.850> like<00:04:06.000> office<00:04:06.330> furniture

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it looks like office furniture

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.910 
it looks like office furniture
but<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.610> suppose<00:04:08.940> there's<00:04:09.270> ways<00:04:09.420> around

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
but I suppose there's ways around

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.050 
but I suppose there's ways around
dealing<00:04:10.920> with<00:04:11.100> things<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.490> that<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
dealing with things like that but the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
dealing with things like that but the
actual<00:04:12.330> drive<00:04:12.570> itself<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.230> very<00:04:13.470> good<00:04:13.770> this

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
actual drive itself is very good this

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.150 
actual drive itself is very good this
sounds<00:04:14.730> very<00:04:14.790> reliable<00:04:15.510> car<00:04:15.750> make<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.350> think

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
sounds very reliable car make I think

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.650 
sounds very reliable car make I think
you're<00:04:17.250> really<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:17.670> to<00:04:17.730> go<00:04:17.880> wrong<00:04:18.209> with<00:04:18.480> one

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
you're really going to go wrong with one

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.199 
you're really going to go wrong with one
of<00:04:18.750> these<00:04:18.870> cars<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:20.370> my<00:04:20.700> only<00:04:20.910> advice<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
of these cars but my only advice to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.680 
of these cars but my only advice to
anybody<00:04:21.860> would<00:04:22.860> be<00:04:22.980> as<00:04:23.130> said<00:04:23.480> look<00:04:24.480> at<00:04:24.600> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
anybody would be as said look at the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.410 
anybody would be as said look at the
steering<00:04:24.990> because<00:04:25.260> there's<00:04:25.620> something<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.420> lot

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
steering because there's something a lot

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.420 
steering because there's something a lot
of<00:04:27.540> play<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:28.050> steering<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.100> hasn't

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
of play in that steering and it hasn't

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.340 
of play in that steering and it hasn't
done<00:04:29.520> 30,000<00:04:30.240> miles<00:04:30.420> so<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:30.750> not<00:04:30.840> likely<00:04:31.170> to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
done 30,000 miles so it's not likely to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.650 
done 30,000 miles so it's not likely to
be<00:04:31.470> worn<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.970> just<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.300> test<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
be worn I'm just going to test the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.060 
be worn I'm just going to test the
brakes<00:04:33.810> out<00:04:34.200> now<00:04:34.410> I'm<00:04:34.560> not<00:04:34.710> going<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.860> do<00:04:34.980> an

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
brakes out now I'm not going to do an

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.710 
brakes out now I'm not going to do an
emergency<00:04:35.370> stop<00:04:36.000> I'm<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:36.330> going<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.510> brake

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
emergency stop I'm just going to brake

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.790 
emergency stop I'm just going to brake
firmly<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.840> brakes<00:04:40.140> are<00:04:40.350> very<00:04:40.380> powerful

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
firmly and the brakes are very powerful

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.360 
firmly and the brakes are very powerful
and<00:04:41.190> smooth<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.310> apply<00:04:44.670> them

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
and smooth and I do get to apply them

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.190 
and smooth and I do get to apply them
gradually<00:04:47.370> rather<00:04:47.760> than<00:04:48.060> any<00:04:48.210> grippy<00:04:48.900> grabby

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
gradually rather than any grippy grabby

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.220 
gradually rather than any grippy grabby
brakes<00:04:49.590> which<00:04:49.980> is<00:04:50.130> good<00:04:50.750> bit<00:04:51.750> heavy<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
brakes which is good bit heavy on the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.870 
brakes which is good bit heavy on the
corners<00:04:52.650> but<00:04:52.830> you've<00:04:52.980> got<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.190> expect<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.700> it

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
corners but you've got to expect that it

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.320 
corners but you've got to expect that it
is<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:54.000> large<00:04:54.300> heavy<00:04:54.570> car<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.760> seems<00:04:57.000> to

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
is a large heavy car but it seems to

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.480 
is a large heavy car but it seems to
settle<00:04:57.990> quite<00:04:58.380> nicely<00:04:58.620> in<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.040> corners

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
settle quite nicely in the corners

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.100 
settle quite nicely in the corners
actually<00:05:01.250> yeah<00:05:02.250> it's<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.970> good<00:05:03.150> car<00:05:03.419> it's<00:05:03.690> a

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
actually yeah it's a good car it's a

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.390 
actually yeah it's a good car it's a
good<00:05:04.290> car<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> can't<00:05:04.919> find<00:05:05.100> anything

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
good car I can't find anything

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.030 
good car I can't find anything
particularly<00:05:06.000> negative<00:05:06.150> about<00:05:06.540> this<00:05:06.720> vehicle

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
particularly negative about this vehicle

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.630 
particularly negative about this vehicle
it's<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.130> lot<00:05:08.280> better<00:05:08.490> than<00:05:08.730> I<00:05:08.820> anticipated<00:05:09.140> and

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
it's a lot better than I anticipated and

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.820 
it's a lot better than I anticipated and
I<00:05:11.900> would<00:05:12.900> recommend<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.980> car<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.430> anybody
