final fitting of the patch box lid to
the<00:00:08.760> wood<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.180> stock<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.309> we're<00:00:11.309> gonna

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
the wood of the stock and we're gonna

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.980 
the wood of the stock and we're gonna
fit<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> brass<00:00:12.540> butt<00:00:12.870> plate<00:00:14.990> well

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
fit it to the brass butt plate well

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.650 
fit it to the brass butt plate well
after<00:00:16.200> I<00:00:16.259> got<00:00:16.290> the<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.220> side<00:00:17.490> plate<00:00:17.910> secured

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
after I got the the side plate secured

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
after I got the the side plate secured
to<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> stock<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:20.310> found<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:20.849> patch

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to the stock I just found that the patch

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.300 
to the stock I just found that the patch
box<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.599> binding<00:00:22.200> up<00:00:22.349> on<00:00:22.560> me<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.009> laying

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
box was binding up on me and not laying

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.850 
box was binding up on me and not laying
flat<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.960> probably<00:00:25.259> should<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.619> done

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
flat and I probably should have done

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.929 
flat and I probably should have done
this<00:00:26.099> before<00:00:27.259> but<00:00:28.259> what<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.399> is<00:00:29.610> I<00:00:29.730> took

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
this before but what I've done is I took

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.770 
this before but what I've done is I took
the<00:00:30.270> patch<00:00:30.599> box<00:00:30.869> apart<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.940> opening

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the patch box apart and I'm just opening

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:43.270 
the patch box apart and I'm just opening
up<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:37.200> cuts<00:00:37.560> here<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:39.530> on<00:00:40.530> both<00:00:41.370> plates<00:00:41.870> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
up the cuts here on on both plates and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.350 
up the cuts here on on both plates and
I'm<00:00:44.280> stoning<00:00:45.050> stoning<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> knuckles<00:00:47.360> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I'm stoning stoning over the knuckles so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
I'm stoning stoning over the knuckles so
that<00:00:48.690> things<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.320> operate<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:49.800> bit

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that things will operate a little bit

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
that things will operate a little bit
more<00:00:50.220> smoothly<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.810> done

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
more smoothly so I'm gonna get that done

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
more smoothly so I'm gonna get that done
and<00:00:52.290> put<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.500> back<00:00:52.650> together<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.600> slap<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.630> on

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and put it back together and slap it on

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.280 
and put it back together and slap it on
the<00:00:54.930> stock<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:56.010> doing

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
the stock and see how we're doing

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.630 
the stock and see how we're doing
okay<00:00:58.290> here's<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.680> I've<00:00:58.890> done<00:00:59.100> we'll<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.550> if

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
okay here's what I've done we'll see if

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.680 
okay here's what I've done we'll see if
it<00:00:59.760> works<00:00:59.790> I've<00:01:00.690> lowered<00:01:01.460> all<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.790> spaces<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it works I've lowered all the spaces on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.420 
it works I've lowered all the spaces on
both<00:01:04.320> pieces<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.659> on<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> actual<00:01:07.350> patch<00:01:08.159> box

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
both pieces and on the actual patch box

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.240 
both pieces and on the actual patch box
lid<00:01:08.880> I've<00:01:09.450> filed<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.260> bevel<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.909> each<00:01:11.909> piece<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
lid I've filed a bevel on each piece and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.320 
lid I've filed a bevel on each piece and
on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.370> side<00:01:14.610> plate

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on the side plate

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.850 
on the side plate
I<00:01:15.890> don't<00:01:16.890> know<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.190> will<00:01:17.370> show<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
I don't know this will show up but I

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.149 
I don't know this will show up but I
flattened<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.750> inside<00:01:22.260> of<00:01:22.560> each<00:01:22.680> knuckle

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
flattened out the inside of each knuckle

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.210 
flattened out the inside of each knuckle
and<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:24.659> should<00:01:25.080> give<00:01:25.350> me<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.979> more

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and that should give me a little more

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
and that should give me a little more
clearance<00:01:26.960> when<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> closing<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> put

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
clearance when it's closing so now I put

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.789 
clearance when it's closing so now I put
it<00:01:29.370> back<00:01:29.490> together<00:01:29.670> try<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> gun<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
it back together try it on the gun and

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
it back together try it on the gun and
hopefully<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.010> gonna<00:01:32.220> work<00:01:32.400> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.659> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hopefully this is gonna work okay so now

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.550 
hopefully this is gonna work okay so now
instead<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.710> binding<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.090> point

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
instead of binding up at this point

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.590 
instead of binding up at this point
which<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:37.979> doing<00:01:38.220> before<00:01:38.570> now<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
which is what I was doing before now I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.560 
which is what I was doing before now I
can<00:01:39.869> close<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.710> hinge<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.310> down

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
can close the the hinge all the way down

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
can close the the hinge all the way down
so<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> difference<00:01:43.710> we'll

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so that should make a difference we'll

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.969 
so that should make a difference we'll
put<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.640> we'll<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.470> well<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.710> looks<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
put it on we'll go well it looks like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.899 
put it on we'll go well it looks like

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cutting those reliefs did exactly what I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.210 
cutting those reliefs did exactly what I
wanted<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.330> do<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:54.979> all<00:01:55.979> in

apart<00:02:21.030> again<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:23.040> reason<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.580> time<00:02:23.819> is

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
apart again and the reason this time is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
because I've got to fit it to the butt

that they would have left that you know
that<00:03:00.600> whole<00:03:00.780> piece<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> I'm

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that whole piece on there and so I'm

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.400 
that whole piece on there and so I'm
going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> take<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.480> off<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.840> I've<00:03:03.959> marked<00:03:04.170> up

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
going to take it off so I've marked up

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.479 
going to take it off so I've marked up
and<00:03:04.890> now<00:03:05.130> I'm<00:03:05.220> gonna<00:03:05.340> cut<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:07.080> try<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
and now I'm gonna cut it and just try to

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.009 
and now I'm gonna cut it and just try to
take<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:08.819> off<00:03:08.880> over<00:03:09.300> here<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.660> flatten

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
take it right off over here and flatten

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.729 
take it right off over here and flatten
it<00:03:10.080> out<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.420> hopefully<00:03:12.420> that'll<00:03:13.380> do<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
it out and hopefully that'll do the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.309 
it out and hopefully that'll do the
trick

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
trick

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.729 
trick
well<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.560> cut<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.040> off<00:03:18.050> now<00:03:19.050> I've<00:03:19.260> got<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.530> file

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
well I cut it off now I've got to file

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.880 
well I cut it off now I've got to file
it<00:03:19.890> down<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:21.799> hopefully<00:03:24.709> everything's<00:03:25.709> gonna

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
it down and hopefully everything's gonna

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.270 
it down and hopefully everything's gonna
work<00:03:25.980> out<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.489> fine<00:03:27.420> okay

the the hinge knuckle off before the
butt<00:04:04.260> plate<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.579> should<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:05.940> done

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
butt plate that what I should have done

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.180 
butt plate that what I should have done
is<00:04:06.329> just<00:04:06.359> filed<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> butt<00:04:07.170> plate<00:04:07.380> down<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
is just filed the butt plate down to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.180 
is just filed the butt plate down to
accept<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> full<00:04:08.970> hinge<00:04:09.269> knuckle<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.190> that's

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
accept the full hinge knuckle and that's

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.250 
accept the full hinge knuckle and that's
the<00:04:11.430> way<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.700> should<00:04:11.910> be<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:14.600> now<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.810> only<00:04:16.019> know

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
the way it should be so now I only know

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.650 
the way it should be so now I only know
what<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.500> know<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.519> learned<00:04:17.760> this<00:04:17.940> too<00:04:18.180> late

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
what I know and I learned this too late

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.289 
what I know and I learned this too late
so<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.989> you're<00:04:19.169> doing<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.789> don't<00:04:20.789> do<00:04:21.060> what<00:04:21.180> I

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
so if you're doing it don't do what I

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.050 
so if you're doing it don't do what I
just<00:04:21.329> did<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.780> cut<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.560> knuckle<00:04:22.950> down<00:04:23.130> just

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
just did and cut this knuckle down just

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.960 
just did and cut this knuckle down just
take<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.210> rattail<00:04:24.690> file<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.530> cut<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> groove<00:04:26.610> in

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
take a rattail file and cut a groove in

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.210 
take a rattail file and cut a groove in
the<00:04:27.060> butt<00:04:27.240> plate<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.260> knuckle<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.770> lay<00:04:28.979> on

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
the butt plate so the knuckle can lay on

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.920 
the butt plate so the knuckle can lay on
it

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.939 
it
okay<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:31.289> now<00:04:31.919> I've<00:04:32.370> got<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.940> get<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:34.410> area<00:04:34.740> of

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
okay so now I've got to get this area of

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.730 
okay so now I've got to get this area of
the<00:04:35.070> butt<00:04:35.250> plate<00:04:35.460> right<00:04:35.729> here<00:04:36.030> basically<00:04:37.020> down

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
the butt plate right here basically down

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.909 
the butt plate right here basically down
to<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.160> level<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.639> this<00:04:39.150> mortise<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:40.620> that

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
to the level of this mortise so that

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.920 
to the level of this mortise so that
this<00:04:41.880> will<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.210> able<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.509> open<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:42.930> close<00:04:43.169> and

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
this will be able to open and close and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.210 
this will be able to open and close and
you<00:04:45.930> know<00:04:45.960> lay<00:04:46.229> flat<00:04:46.669> so<00:04:48.020> what<00:04:49.020> I<00:04:49.050> did<00:04:49.199> is<00:04:49.650> I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
you know lay flat so what I did is I

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.120 
you know lay flat so what I did is I
took<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.460> hacksaw<00:04:51.090> with<00:04:51.270> fine<00:04:51.479> teeth<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.860> cut

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
took a hacksaw with fine teeth and I cut

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.689 
took a hacksaw with fine teeth and I cut
a<00:04:53.160> couple<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.610> boundary<00:04:54.060> lines<00:04:55.460> where<00:04:56.460> that

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
a couple of boundary lines where that

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.629 
a couple of boundary lines where that
lid<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.030> going<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.509> fit<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.320> now<00:04:59.160> I've<00:04:59.430> got<00:04:59.610> a

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
lid is going to fit and now I've got a

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.629 
lid is going to fit and now I've got a
three-cornered<00:05:00.120> file<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.410> side<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:02.580> a

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
three-cornered file and one side is a

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.240 
three-cornered file and one side is a
safe<00:05:03.090> side<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.780> that's<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> side<00:05:04.830> I'm

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
safe side and that's the side I'm

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.749 
safe side and that's the side I'm
putting<00:05:05.610> up<00:05:05.849> against<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.990> edge<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:08.340> I'm<00:05:08.520> just

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
putting up against the edge and I'm just

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.219 
putting up against the edge and I'm just
basically<00:05:09.210> cutting<00:05:09.870> those<00:05:10.020> boundary<00:05:10.650> lines

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
basically cutting those boundary lines

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:21.469 
basically cutting those boundary lines
deeper<00:05:18.410> get<00:05:19.410> them<00:05:19.530> down<00:05:19.849> pretty<00:05:20.849> close<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.389> the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
deeper get them down pretty close to the

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.580 
deeper get them down pretty close to the
wood<00:05:21.690> here<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:23.509> that<00:05:24.509> way<00:05:24.690> when<00:05:24.900> I'm<00:05:25.020> using<00:05:25.229> my

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
wood here and that way when I'm using my

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.790 
wood here and that way when I'm using my
file<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.669> take<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:27.090> off<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.750> won't<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:30.800> won't

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
file to take this off I won't I won't

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.740 
file to take this off I won't I won't
have<00:05:31.949> a<00:05:31.979> tendency<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.580> overrun<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.389> cut<00:05:33.720> so

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
have a tendency to overrun that cut so

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.860 
have a tendency to overrun that cut so
I'm<00:05:36.750> just<00:05:36.960> going<00:05:37.139> to<00:05:37.169> get<00:05:38.449> get<00:05:39.449> that<00:05:39.479> pretty

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
I'm just going to get get that pretty

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.770 
I'm just going to get get that pretty
close<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.320> wood<00:05:40.699> on<00:05:41.699> both<00:05:42.000> sides<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.659> then

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
close to the wood on both sides and then

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.140 
close to the wood on both sides and then
I'm<00:05:42.900> going<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.110> switch<00:05:43.320> over<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.830> start<00:05:44.150> using

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
I'm going to switch over and start using

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.450 
I'm going to switch over and start using
a<00:05:45.570> bastard<00:05:46.500> file<00:05:46.680> and<00:05:47.389> taking<00:05:48.389> all<00:05:48.539> this<00:05:48.659> down

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
but plates on match boxes in just look

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.529 
but plates on match boxes in just look
at<00:05:56.909> a<00:05:56.940> trim<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:57.840> and<00:05:58.460> fit<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.639> mark<00:06:00.120> this<00:06:00.300> with

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
