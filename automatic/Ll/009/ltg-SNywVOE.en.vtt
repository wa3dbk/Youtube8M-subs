lot of mobility and it allows for the

lifespan screening colonoscopies have

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.399 
lifespan screening colonoscopies have
allowed<00:01:07.110> us<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.369> remove<00:01:08.369> potential<00:01:09.409> pre

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
cancer or even early cancers and I think

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.080 
cancer or even early cancers and I think
the<00:01:14.880> data<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.509> shows<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.580> making<00:01:17.759> an

the data now shows that we are making an

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
the data now shows that we are making an

cancer by screening it is important when

cancer by screening it is important when
we<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.600> patients<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> office<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> the

appropriately<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.909> most<00:01:57.090> cases<00:01:57.420> we

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
appropriately I think in most cases we

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
appropriately I think in most cases we
have<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> clear<00:01:58.350> idea<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.829> what's<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
have a clear idea what what's what the

that<00:02:02.520> being<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> physician<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.549> greatest
