00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
devastated after that I was that was a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.090 
devastated after that I was that was a
heartbreaking<00:03:46.900> moment<00:03:47.350> where<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.650> lost<00:03:47.860> his

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
heartbreaking moment where I lost his

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.980 
heartbreaking moment where I lost his
survival<00:03:48.459> games<00:03:48.610> like<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.819> cuz<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.750> really

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
survival games like that cuz I really

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.780 
survival games like that cuz I really
lose<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.319> much<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.190> I've<00:03:51.430> been<00:03:51.520> losing<00:03:51.610> a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
lose that much and I've been losing a

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.210 
lose that much and I've been losing a
lot<00:03:51.819> lately<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.590> think<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.860> reason<00:03:54.040> is

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
lot lately but I think the reason is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.680 
lot lately but I think the reason is
because<00:03:54.430> I've<00:03:54.700> been<00:03:54.850> playing<00:03:55.030> survival<00:03:55.510> games

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
because I've been playing survival games

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.540 
because I've been playing survival games
where<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.830> like<00:03:56.920> it's<00:03:57.160> like<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.310> weird

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
where it's like it's like a weird

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.730 
where it's like it's like a weird
survival<00:03:57.910> game<00:03:58.060> it's<00:03:58.270> like<00:03:58.590> there's<00:03:59.590> like<00:03:59.680> a

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
survival game it's like there's like a

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.810 
survival game it's like there's like a
deaf<00:03:59.950> math<00:04:00.190> with<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.550> it's<00:04:00.640> like<00:04:00.670> the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
deaf math with you and it's like the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.550 
deaf math with you and it's like the
official<00:04:01.180> one<00:04:01.300> I<00:04:01.330> think<00:04:01.450> that's<00:04:01.630> what<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
official one I think that's what is the
