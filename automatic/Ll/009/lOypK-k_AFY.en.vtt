here's one of your masters can pavilions

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.419 
here's one of your masters can pavilions
and<00:00:12.559> the<00:00:13.559> first<00:00:13.769> step<00:00:13.980> you're<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> get

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and the first step you're going to get

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.490 
and the first step you're going to get
the<00:00:14.549> legs<00:00:14.759> out<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.450> each<00:00:15.690> leg<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.289> need<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the legs out in each leg we need to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.880 
the legs out in each leg we need to
extend<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> way<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.500> push<00:00:19.740> in

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
extend all the way so first we push in

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:34.370 
extend all the way so first we push in
this<00:00:20.039> push-button<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.960> triangle<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.930> put

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this push-button this triangle and put

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:47.569 
this push-button this triangle and put
one<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> pins<00:00:35.160> through<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:46.430> now<00:00:47.430> we're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one of the pins through there now we're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
one of the pins through there now we're
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> take<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> starfish<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> Middle

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
going to take the starfish the Middle

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.610 
going to take the starfish the Middle
star<00:00:49.289> piece

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:15.830 

you're<00:00:52.010> going<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.280> attach<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.940> legs

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:33.139 

take<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> other<00:01:17.110> leg

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.179 

so<00:01:34.149> this<00:01:34.299> is<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.540> we<00:01:35.049> finish<00:01:35.409> correcting<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
so this is a we finish correcting the

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.850 
so this is a we finish correcting the
star<00:01:36.460> structure<00:01:36.970> now<00:01:37.780> every<00:01:38.080> leg<00:01:38.290> went<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.680> and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
star structure now every leg went in and

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.429 
star structure now every leg went in and
now<00:01:38.979> we've<00:01:39.100> started<00:01:39.280> put<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> walls<00:01:39.820> on

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
now we've started put the walls on

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.219 
now we've started put the walls on
basically<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.649> can<00:01:41.770> put<00:01:41.950> floor<00:01:42.250> at<00:01:42.430> first<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
basically you can put floor at first to

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.080 
basically you can put floor at first to
put<00:01:44.439> these<00:01:44.649> up<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.399> know<00:01:48.520> again<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.939> make<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
put these up you know again to make a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.480 
put these up you know again to make a
triangle<00:01:49.450> brace<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.860> put<00:01:51.070> one<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.429> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
triangle brace and you put one of the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.419 
triangle brace and you put one of the
pins<00:01:51.729> through<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:53.289> other<00:01:53.439> pin<00:01:53.799> is<00:01:54.039> used<00:01:54.250> for

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
pins through the other pin is used for

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.830 
pins through the other pin is used for
the<00:01:54.520> counter<00:01:54.880> when<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.630> all<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the counter when you have all the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.620 
the counter when you have all the
counters<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:57.280> white<00:01:57.759> panel<00:01:58.179> still<00:01:58.390> first

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
counters on the white panel still first

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.960 
counters on the white panel still first
and<00:01:58.869> then<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:58.990> counters<00:01:59.409> go<00:01:59.560> on<00:01:59.709> so<00:02:00.670> put<00:02:00.880> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
and then the counters go on so put the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.359 
and then the counters go on so put the
pins<00:02:01.209> through<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:02.289> need<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.500> line<00:02:02.649> up<00:02:02.860> these

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
pins through we need to line up these

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.510 
pins through we need to line up these
pins<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.990> these<00:02:05.170> receptacles<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:06.190> easiest

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
pins with these receptacles it's easiest

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.490 
pins with these receptacles it's easiest
to<00:02:06.670> start<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.420> end<00:02:07.539> that's<00:02:07.720> already<00:02:07.959> got<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
to start on the end that's already got a

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.740 
to start on the end that's already got a
leg<00:02:08.769> on<00:02:08.799> it<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.160> put<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.459> through

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.120 

down<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.910> then<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.270> move<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.660> other<00:02:20.780> leg

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
down and then we can move the other leg

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.260 
down and then we can move the other leg
to<00:02:22.130> where<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.430> line<00:02:22.580> up<00:02:22.610> you're<00:02:23.150> just

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
to where it will line up you're just

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.430 
to where it will line up you're just
going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.570> fiddle<00:02:23.810> with<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.080> but

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
going to have to fiddle with it but

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.540 
going to have to fiddle with it but
shoot<00:02:26.020> hey<00:02:27.020> Carole<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.470> Heather<00:02:27.530> two<00:02:28.220> steps

shoot hey Carole and Heather two steps

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.970 
shoot hey Carole and Heather two steps
we<00:02:29.300> got<00:02:29.510> all<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.690> white<00:02:29.930> panels<00:02:30.380> all<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.890> way

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
we got all the white panels all the way

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.410 
we got all the white panels all the way
around<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.580> counters<00:02:31.940> go<00:02:32.090> on<00:02:32.180> top

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
around and then the counters go on top

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.310 
around and then the counters go on top
and<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.410> counters<00:02:33.740> are<00:02:33.920> slots<00:02:35.200> here<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
and the counters are slots here the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.110 
and the counters are slots here the
little<00:02:36.470> metal<00:02:36.680> tabs<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.640> drop<00:02:37.850> right

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
little metal tabs will just drop right

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.550 
little metal tabs will just drop right
into<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:43.630> right<00:02:44.630> into<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> spot<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
into the right into the spot in the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.590 
into the right into the spot in the
metal<00:02:45.800> fixture<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> counters<00:02:47.420> get

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
metal fixture and then the counters get

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.360 
metal fixture and then the counters get
their<00:02:47.750> own<00:02:47.870> pin<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.380> well<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:52.100> will<00:02:52.250> go

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
their own pin as well that that will go

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.820 
their own pin as well that that will go
all<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> way<00:02:52.640> through<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:56.560> counter<00:02:57.560> script<00:02:57.620> on

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
all the way through so counter script on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.040 
all the way through so counter script on
pen<00:02:58.070> then<00:02:58.670> we<00:02:58.820> need<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.970> put<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.360> roof<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.720> this

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
pen then we need to put the roof on this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.120 
pen then we need to put the roof on this
is<00:03:00.200> where<00:03:00.320> you're<00:03:00.440> probably<00:03:00.650> need<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> most

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
is where you're probably need the most

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.440 
is where you're probably need the most
tilt<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:04.340> roof<00:03:04.550> needs<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.880> be<00:03:04.940> draped<00:03:05.270> over

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
tilt the roof needs to be draped over

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.600 
tilt the roof needs to be draped over
the<00:03:05.660> frame<00:03:05.920> easiest<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.070> do<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.580> to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
the frame easiest way to do it is to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.270 
the frame easiest way to do it is to
throw<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.300> roof<00:03:08.450> up<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.870> then<00:03:09.440> unfold<00:03:10.070> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
throw the roof up and then unfold it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.850 
throw the roof up and then unfold it
over<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:10.700> peak<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.900> peak<00:03:12.260> part<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> what<00:03:12.770> we

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
over that peak that peak part is what we

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.530 
over that peak that peak part is what we
need<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> flagpole<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.180> also<00:03:14.330> where

need for the flagpole this is also where
you're<00:03:14.720> going<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> want<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.080> put<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> flag<00:03:15.530> on

you're going to want to put the flag on

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.710 
you're going to want to put the flag on
there's<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.160> grommet<00:03:16.400> right<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.880> top<00:03:17.090> you

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
there's a grommet right on the top you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.210 
there's a grommet right on the top you
can<00:03:17.840> drop<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> flag<00:03:18.500> pole<00:03:18.770> right<00:03:18.950> into<00:03:19.160> the

can drop the flag pole right into the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.190 
can drop the flag pole right into the
grommet<00:03:19.430> before<00:03:20.300> we<00:03:20.390> finish<00:03:20.720> extending<00:03:21.110> the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
grommet before we finish extending the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.460 
grommet before we finish extending the
roof<00:03:21.489> last<00:03:22.489> step<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.150> extend<00:03:23.540> the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
roof last step is to extend the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
shoulders all the way and then it will

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.539 
shoulders all the way and then it will
pin<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:28.690> every<00:03:29.690> roof<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.680> this<00:03:31.010> corner<00:03:31.400> there

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
pin it every roof on this corner there

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.809 
pin it every roof on this corner there
will<00:03:31.670> be<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> little

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
will be a little
