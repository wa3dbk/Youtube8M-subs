00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.350
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.729
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.970
 Nice to meet you Today is 5 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.590
 Thank you for your theme today 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.541
 Here's a super fast fretboard serve 

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:18.250
 I will try to introduce the way 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.090
 I previously had a video called high-speed fret serve 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.780
 I put out a quick side turn 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.260
 Further study the chopsticks serve 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.410
 I made it faster 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 It is possible to complete the ultra-fast freckle serve 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.559
 I did it this way to everyone 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.749
 If you want to take a serve ace you want to share 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:41.399
 If you want to score points with horizontal rotation serve 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:01:02.260
 It is a must see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.839
 Even plastic balls were very easy to get points 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.280
 Because it is a serve, everyone 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.250
 Give this ultra-fast freckle serve to your serve 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 Keep in mind today's super-fast frying serve 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.369
 How to do it in just one step 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.000
 Add one more step to the basic freckle serve method 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.491
 First of all, it's in the chopstick serve 

00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:25.740
 I will easily review the way everyone is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.380
 First of all, it's the way to serve the speedy side-turn serve. 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.091
 First of all, on the side where the racket is turned 

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:36.840
 Please be on the side of the racket 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.351
 It is such a feeling In the face that I'm going to put a side turn 

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.030
 Please after this time 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.869
 The end of the racket is facing the opponent 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.820
 The other party is facing the other party 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 In this image it is pretending to be in this state conscious of being turned 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.210
 Shake the racket with this image 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.760
 Delivering a fast serve of intense lateral rotation 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.429
 Become a strong serve of sideways speeding 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.030
 That's what I mean, but this fretboard serve 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.970
 Super fast freckle serve in just one step 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.100
 Transforming It's a study 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.190
 It means to lower this toss 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.550
 In fact, when you give this chopstick serve 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.140
 16cm toss range 16cm on the rule 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.080
 It is the height of the net It is lowered in this last limit 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.220
 If you make a low toss, it will actually serve you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.920
 Becomes Faster Serve Becomes Faster 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.010
 The image with strong rotation is better if you raise the toss 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.860
 I think it will be faster because it can be used in reaction 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.110
 I think everyone thinks but actually toss 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.930
 It is not the one who raises it, but in fact toss 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.160
 It is the lifeline of speed serve by lowering it 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.130
 It is more than a regular toss to say hitting point 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:19.590
 Can be captured low 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.350
 It was the same with Rocket Serve, though 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.160
 When we give fast long serve everyone 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.450
 The position is as high as possible at the lowest point where the hitting point is high 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.180
 It is called Tatan like this if it is a low position 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.190
 It will be faster with just the pitch at the timing of the hitting point 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.760
 So if you lower the hitting position as much as possible, the long system serves 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.931
 It is said that the speed system serves faster 

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:44.120
 I think everyone knows 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.380
 This freckle serve is also a small toss 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.600
 Drop the ball down by making a low toss 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.310
 I can do it and it will be easier to drop further down 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.690
 So certainly when you raise the toss 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.920
 It's difficult to catch it at low cost 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.040
 Because I'm going to go from above 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.860
 I tend to hit at a slightly higher position than usual 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.250
 Then the speed of the long serve is fast 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.731
 A quick serve called Tatan on the pitch 

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.720
 It is difficult to put out, but by lowering the toss 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.650
 The part that gives this hitting point and the after power 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.820
 I can further narrow down 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.850
 In the image of the pendulum collected in this one point 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.810
 Shake in this small toss 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.390
 It is all right with the small eyes 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.070
 The sense of stability also increases While increasing the sense of stability 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.790
 Properly pinpoint power 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.190
 Easy to tell and hit the ball properly 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.410
 In terms of being fast and easy to pack 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.370
 I can measure speed up and feel stable 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.810
 In terms of less services 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.120
 The sense of stability also increases while serving as a super fast freckle serve 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:59.400
 So it will be a highly recommended serve 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 The good thing about serving is 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 I can not see the image that comes faster 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.460
 If you look at the other party, make the toss far apart 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.240
 If it will be greatly sprinkled by this image 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 Somewhat fast from the other party comes fast serve 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.070
 The other party thinks so 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.960
 So I'll be waiting for you while I'm waiting 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.660
 It will be said that this super-fast flicking serve 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.340
 Because the toss only raised 16 cm 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.990
 I do not have time to do toss 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.889
 So what does it mean? 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.730
 I feel like this I feel like this 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.610
 It's fast soon after the other party stands 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.630
 The other party looks like it's like Sassassass. 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.889
 Oh that's as fast as it comes 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:58.340
 There is also a merit that you can not predict on the way 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.580
 The tip of this racket is after the serve 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.620
 The lower you go down, the lower you are and the more you serve. 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.150
 I like this tip is coming up 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.389
 It is this side down when it comes to feeling 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.520
 Downside upside down 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.060
 Side-down use 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.270
 We can use properly in plane and keep in plane of lateral rotation 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.620
 16cm smaller toss with the end open 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:27.090
 Take this takeback by pretending to be the height and net of the net 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.250
 It is only this if you lower the hitting point 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.990
 If it is good that the super-high speed freckle serve is completed 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.389
 Thank you for trying it out
