00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.059
 yeah 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.709
 yeah given that I think tripled 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.420
 against brugge and a goal against hamburg 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.450
 and that you are well deserved so here we go 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.779
 bravo a chance for the end of the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.080
 season 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.789
 thank you very much for charles but you 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.150
 can not the soul but mimi is too much 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.400
 Brigitte is a bit of a success 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.839
 collective if I'm going to abandon the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 success of our team because 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.559
 since the beginning of the season 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.149
 in fact we have a good season 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 after we'll say that these play offs and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.290
 everything is very important because the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 club had already played playoffs and 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.390
 had not gone very well so this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 year we had the heart of well participated 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the world the hearts what we did 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.710
 during the normal phase that you can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.320
 try to 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.329
 we have in these play off after we will say 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 than on some matches like that of 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.769
 more play 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.409
 where there is an amalgam of everything there is the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.159
 success ago there have been some beautiful 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.319
 collective phases too 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.780
 and here I am attributed to all 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:16.780
 world dreads start of this match at bruges 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.179
 mark iii sensational goal killed in state 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.759
 thank goodness it 's something 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.409
 for example, that we feel before 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.069
 match is what we say here you feel 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.039
 very well 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.649
 yes it's true that often it happens and 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.450
 that as soon as you warm up, you feel a bit 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.329
 push wings for the conditions 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.280
 like that because here we come from him 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.740
 and I also had a motivation 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.079
 outside it was the birthday 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.980
 of my son and that here I know he 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.980
 wants to watch on TV that he is 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.070
 who loses focus on that easy to the jud 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.260
 is ok this is I have not blown your tone 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.820
 cake but I will be the football is a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.850
 portrait a t shirt for you to say 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 we all put in the not so 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.900
 goals 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.640
 swizz on the finish I think if I 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.080
 make a colonist to control defense had 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.050
 well very quickly that's it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.119
 and that there was a choice to make 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.530
 knock like I'm out of the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.970
 surface so it had to put a lot 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.070
 a lot more power 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.080
 that's it we really feel at a time 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:22.250
 given that you want to be a little bit 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:26.990
 short on the second after the pass of 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.610
 accounts and Thursday a touch finally and there 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.120
 they buy him from killed on the first 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 touch and I control and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.540
 as soon as the steering wheel is in front of me I feel 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 that the neighborhood can not see the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.340
 departure had depended like that it's the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.900
 third is the third you said yes 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.549
 there are many things to explain 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.440
 because it was a balloon 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.900
 millimeter to count because there is the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.239
 work that does before he waits the good 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.700
 timing is sure first call he the 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.340
 guard who is waiting for him and he puts them on the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 second and and on the second call that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.519
 I'm doing the pass just millimeter the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.090
 more beautiful what is she so first 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:10.510
 second or third occurred 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.099
 like you seasonal yes it's a beautiful 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.019
 gift that you made your easter 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.450
 if 50 buses yes it's finally played 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.069
 to a few things because you could have 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 do not play this game you had taken a 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.930
 red card the previous match against the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.459
 standard and then the committee ruled that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.989
 this sanction was sufficient 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.109
 thankfully or unfortunately I had 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.690
 of the bowl that's for sure that's it's the 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.329
 reflection that made me win 2 at the end 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.010
 of the match so saying to me yes you have 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.370
 scored but normally you have not played 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.900
 so yes I have a lot of luck on this 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.180
 match there I think it was already 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.950
 come together for me to do a very 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.410
 good match and then in these playoffs 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.359
 you also miss two penaltys that's 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.430
 especially because we call ourselves baye 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.040
 this is the guy really trusting the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.140
 that's with the penaltys every time 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.790
 that you take the ball is 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.470
 and someone who wants to come and hit him 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.569
 that you are a little in discussions 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.920
 it's a bit harder the first 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.260
 game and organs that wanted to hit him 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.080
 that I said no I will do it with 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.140
 the concentration is no longer this time 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.440
 with franck it's often the same 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.480
 think that the ideal is that when 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.100
 that she understands the balloon that one is 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.630
 sure they want to hit called not 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:31.480
 discussion and concentration is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:35.740
 better like that at the end of the match 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.200
 against genk on the road at the entrance this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.390
 that I had it penalty but dad 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.820
 What is the penalty you made us 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.270
 a joke 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.520
 he made a second time desire to 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.470
 tried the same to it's practically the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.370
 even the little slap with franck 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.630
 it's because of this story of 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.130
 penaltys stimulus and boussens as to 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.190
 data went out of its hinges 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.900
 yes but because it's a situation 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.340
 where a lot of people did not 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.680
 glimpses of what happened 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.800
 just now I have reviewed the images 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.720
 on a chain that shows exactly the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.440
 pictures because at the moment I put the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.570
 free ball that places the ball 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.150
 is then that the gt in concentration and 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.300
 but it is an explanation but after 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.070
 as I said if he did it me I 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.390
 do I apologize because I'm 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.250
 in football field which at some 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.990
 reactions that we can not see because 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.820
 that it's mostly there are a lot 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.950
 of children who are in the stalls ya 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.140
 a lot of young people watching and that 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.660
 we have to give a better example 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.420
 than what I did 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.410
 I am the first to conceive that it is 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.770
 do not on a football field 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.570
 directly with a hot reaction I 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.800
 do not know how to make the year 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.570
 next to zulte-waregem will be there 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.790
 only mba and the others but we 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.350
 will not have the tempting idea authorities to 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.110
 hockey what's going on through the 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.700
 head at that moment oh no he's spending nothing 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.570
 on the head it's a c1 it's a 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.940
 normal feeling and if a feeling that 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.740
 more maybe if I had not 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.350
 do right now in the pickups and the 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.360
 to do two days after that would have been 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.740
 maybe different interpret because 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.850
 that some people think that I 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.750
 think about transfers where I think of a 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.670
 individuality but no it's not the case 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.980
 and now as I am well steel at 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.000
 cold I repeat the same thing so I 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.170
 told him where his name 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.400
 I think maybe it's the 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.500
 best solutions for the club 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.690
 but as I say 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.010
 after we have time at the end of the season 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:37.680
 says think that and that the owner 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.870
 the coach everyone and recoil 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.250
 and think about what he decides even and what 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.550
 will surely be the best 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.550
 solution 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:50.250
 I know you're passionate about 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.960
 philosophy literature it's some 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.540
 what you are in life in general 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.930
 and in your football career 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.490
 yes but that's before I was player 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.610
 of football now I have a brain of 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.620
 so football has gely a lot less and 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.150
 I forgot even 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.760
 the philosophers north but is it 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.770
 maybe it's the fact of having made 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.210
 studies or or something like that it 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.750
 allows to have a little perspective too 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.720
 in what we do and that's it helps 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.110
 its part there is not only football in the 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.120
 life 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:26.280
 there are other things to the family at the 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.840
 normal people in parentheses that 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.040
 there is respect to having both there 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.330
 all these people and to consider them 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.440
 you must not be mistaken for someone 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:39.250
 else who has won six months 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:44.990
 congratulations to the new 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:47.800
 yes no 3 3 pocket apps and quotes 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.800
 and good continuation
