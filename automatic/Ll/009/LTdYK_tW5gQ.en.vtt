00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.920
 is found for a video I had 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.140
 already done but I was told there was 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 not too many sounds and yes there was no 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.239
 x 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.899
 first of all you download yourself a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.140
 mode if you already have one and you have 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.190
 a folder you open your files 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.289
 personally as I have a very screen 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.289
 small and I can not change it 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.149
 I had plenty of files 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.230
 but they will not open 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.710
 after I will show you that it is good 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.860
