hey guys this is my hobby zone champ RC
plane<00:00:04.490> and<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.910> probably<00:00:06.390> about<00:00:08.450> 50<00:00:09.450> 70<00:00:09.780> days

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
plane and it's probably about 50 70 days

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.850 
plane and it's probably about 50 70 days
long<00:00:10.190> then<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> came<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> box<00:00:12.110> it's<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.620> great

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
long then I came in the box it's a great

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.070 
long then I came in the box it's a great
little<00:00:14.070> beginners<00:00:14.549> plane<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> lot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
little beginners plane you can do a lot

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840 
little beginners plane you can do a lot
of<00:00:16.139> things<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.650> as<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.100> say<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> small

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of things with it as I say the small

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.300 
of things with it as I say the small
planes<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.390> harder<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> fly<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
planes are harder to fly but if you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.310 
planes are harder to fly but if you
crash<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> smaller<00:00:20.970> ones<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.600> easy<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
crash the smaller ones it's easy to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.820 
crash the smaller ones it's easy to
repair<00:00:22.619> than<00:00:23.090> say<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.900> half<00:00:25.170> meter<00:00:25.500> playing

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
repair than say one half meter playing

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.740 
repair than say one half meter playing
and<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> crash<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.789> fast<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.660> go

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and you crash that as fast as you can go

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.150 
and you crash that as fast as you can go
you're<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.590> much<00:00:28.769> left<00:00:29.070> to

but I would recommend buying a second

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
but I would recommend buying a second
battery<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.759> they're<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.479> fun<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
battery because they're just so fun to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.920 
battery because they're just so fun to
use<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> keep<00:02:01.740> flying<00:02:02.930> but
