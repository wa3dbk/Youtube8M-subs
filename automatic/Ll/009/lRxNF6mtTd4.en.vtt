00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello san giuseppe your instructor 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.610
 then today I have to check the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.349
 vehicle in the front front compartment 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.460
 what they will clearly ask of us 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.309
 also the driving test 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.619
 then we start to see where we need to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.630
 pull the lever lady enter our own 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 friend where there are pedals and you will find 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 on the left side this lever to pull 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.080
 if the TV opens the first shot of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.220
 safety attention because only the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.390
 first as you will see the hood does not open 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 so what can we do without having to look 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 the second one takes the security one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.850
 now I 'll show you exactly 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.149
 in here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.309
 here it is we must crush this 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.920
 lever as we can do 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.350
 insert the hand and you have to do this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.960
 small movement with the same hand 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 they will hear 1 release and finally it is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160
 open the front compartment us in this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 case we don't need to put the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 in safety pin because stan and dipped 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.270
 so the hood stands up by itself 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 let's start with the brake oil check then 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.170
 I have no brakes in this case in the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.150
 mini we must not open the cap in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 how much we have a minimum and a maximum 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 already exposed to the maximum of you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 that the least in this case we are 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 already in place so we can close 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.689
 let's go to the other side from the other side 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.479
 in here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.860
 in this compartment we will find the battery 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.659
 in this case we don't have to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
 do just know that red is 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.790
 positive black is negative if we were to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.950
 hook up with some other cars with 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.220
 our battery a little exhausted a little 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 we pass to the oil control 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 then we have a thorn first 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 which clearly will be dirty there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.869
 we can also bring a cloth 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.259
 in examining it we have to come up with it 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.880
 extract all the apulia mo after which 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.990
 need to enter in this case 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 let's pretend nothing we pull it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.970
 out here the maximum is here on the right 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.430
 on the left it has the minimum enough to see 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 maximum and mine if there were to be missing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
 we can also open this cap is in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.329
 seats and the oil clearly to be poured yes 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.520
 it can open to warm certain that yes this is 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.860
 a room that can be an attack 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.259
 even check hot engine this no 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.330
 this is not because it is refrigerated and if the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 hot engine we can't do it see that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.209
 here too we have the minimum and the maximum 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.840
 in fact you can do everything with the outside 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.269
 to check 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.430
 quietly in this case we are a 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.660
 little below the minimum level 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.400
 now let's go see the liquid 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.470
 you find this washer here at this symbol 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.200
 this can be done safely too 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.030
 when the engine is hot it is not connected to the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 engine 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.890
 we close everything and remember to close the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.780
 compartment we close carefully even with a little 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.269
 of strength is thus they both close 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 safety go to the tires 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.010
 now the tire meanwhile has an abbreviation 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.790
 this acronym which of 195 the width 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.959
 of millimeters 55 relationship between height and 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 radial width 16 and the diameter of the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.040
 circle 87 in this case of the index of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.329
 load and speed index where I find 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.019
 all this they asked the liberator 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.030
 vehicle this is the witness this 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.500
 it means what we never owe 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.540
 get to touch with our own 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.819
 tread we try to be there with the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.200
 nor camera we are highly above 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.510
 in this case then ours 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.940
 tread is good witness for the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.370
 car and a millimeter and 6 for motorcycles a 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.730
 millimeter I can't wait to see you 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.730
 Hello
