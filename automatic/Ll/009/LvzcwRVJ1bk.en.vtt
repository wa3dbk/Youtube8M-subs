00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.039 
an abstract now a research paper for
younger<00:00:10.080> grades<00:00:10.530> can<00:00:11.280> simply<00:00:11.880> be<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
whole project so that somebody could

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
whole project so that somebody could
find<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> did<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.980> learned

and what kind of things you would do

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
and what kind of things you would do
again<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.120> were<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> study<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
again if you if you were to study it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.280 
again if you if you were to study it
again<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.760> research<00:00:42.210> paper<00:00:42.570> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
paper now for an abstract an abstract is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
paper now for an abstract an abstract is
a<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.800> short<00:01:02.390> summary<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.729> have

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
putting it on the video so at the end of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
putting it on the video so at the end of
this<00:01:17.009> video<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> will<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> reference<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:19.200> a
