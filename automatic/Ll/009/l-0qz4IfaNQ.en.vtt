here<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.770> mr.<00:01:59.070> red<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.530> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
here so with mr. red you can see that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
here so with mr. red you can see that
the<00:02:01.799> colors<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.399> sync<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:03.149> very<00:02:03.240> well

that's<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:08.069> coordinated<00:02:08.759> without<00:02:09.479> being

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that's well coordinated without being

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.740 
that's well coordinated without being
