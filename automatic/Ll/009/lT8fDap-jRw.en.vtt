local<00:02:03.640> laundromat<00:02:05.099> make<00:02:06.099> sure<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.310> soak<00:02:06.520> them

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
local laundromat make sure you soak them

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.419 
local laundromat make sure you soak them
first<00:02:06.880> we'll<00:02:07.119> talk<00:02:07.299> all<00:02:07.420> about<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:09.369> is

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
first we'll talk all about that this is

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.690 
first we'll talk all about that this is
a<00:02:09.549> spur<00:02:09.940> this<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.049> when<00:02:11.260> you're<00:02:11.380> buffing<00:02:11.769> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
a spur this is when you're buffing this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.949 
a spur this is when you're buffing this
guy<00:02:13.620> actually<00:02:14.620> goes<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.220> here<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.000> as<00:02:16.750> this

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
guy actually goes on here and as this

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.309 
guy actually goes on here and as this
fills<00:02:17.590> up<00:02:17.799> with<00:02:17.829> polish<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.110> guy

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
fills up with polish you take this guy

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.830 
fills up with polish you take this guy
to<00:02:20.380> clean<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.890> off<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.519> bring<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.269> fibers<00:02:22.660> out

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
to clean it off to bring the fibers out

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.589 
to clean it off to bring the fibers out
again<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.799> can<00:02:24.010> continue<00:02:24.280> using<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.030> pad

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
again so you can continue using a pad

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.569 
again so you can continue using a pad
longer<00:02:26.170> than<00:02:26.380> than<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.340> would<00:02:27.489> have

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
longer than than you would have

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.030 
longer than than you would have
otherwise<00:02:28.560> okay<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:29.889> the<00:02:30.010> first

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
otherwise okay so that's the first

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.009 
otherwise okay so that's the first
couple<00:02:30.639> stages<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:31.060> polishing<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
couple stages of polishing this is the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.530 
couple stages of polishing this is the
actual<00:02:32.260> polish<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.040> use<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.269> called

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
actual polish that we use this is called

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.930 
actual polish that we use this is called
new<00:02:34.870> vite<00:02:35.109> is<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:36.010> company<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.519> makes<00:02:36.730> this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
new vite is the company that makes this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.960 
new vite is the company that makes this
and<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.079> called<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.530> new<00:02:38.859> shine<00:02:39.250> too<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
and this is called a new shine too and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.300 
and this is called a new shine too and
there's<00:02:40.930> three<00:02:41.230> grades<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.950> generally

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
there's three grades that we generally

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.759 
there's three grades that we generally
use<00:02:42.459> when<00:02:42.970> polishing<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.510> trailer<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.500> those

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
use when polishing a trailer and those

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.400 
use when polishing a trailer and those
three<00:02:45.100> grades<00:02:45.400> are<00:02:45.730> grade<00:02:46.090> f9<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.900> that's<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
three grades are grade f9 and that's a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.190 
three grades are grade f9 and that's a
compound<00:02:47.889> for<00:02:48.130> heavy<00:02:48.340> corrosion<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.420> surface

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
compound for heavy corrosion and surface

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.099 
compound for heavy corrosion and surface
repair<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.220> generally<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.810> first

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
repair so generally this is the first

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.289 
repair so generally this is the first
step<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.190> next<00:02:54.220> step<00:02:54.639> we'll<00:02:54.819> use<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.150> called

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
step the next step we'll use is called

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.800 
step the next step we'll use is called
grade<00:02:55.630> C<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.799> is<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.310> oxidation<00:02:57.850> removal

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
grade C this is for oxidation removal

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.220 
grade C this is for oxidation removal
and<00:02:59.109> re<00:02:59.410> polishing<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:01.150> basically<00:03:01.750> buffs<00:03:02.079> it

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
and re polishing that basically buffs it

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.259 
and re polishing that basically buffs it
out<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> mid<00:03:02.829> grade<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.910> final

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
out to a mid grade and then the final

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.809 
out to a mid grade and then the final
step<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.750> new<00:03:04.930> shine<00:03:05.290> finish<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.670> new

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
step the new shine finish or the new

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.569 
step the new shine finish or the new
vite<00:03:07.030> finish<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.690> called<00:03:08.109> grade<00:03:08.410> s<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.040> that

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
vite finish is called grade s and that

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.400 
vite finish is called grade s and that
you<00:03:09.730> actually<00:03:09.910> use<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> different<00:03:10.329> tool<00:03:10.780> these

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
you actually use a different tool these

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.580 
you actually use a different tool these
two<00:03:11.680> polishes<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.940> use<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.720> rotary<00:03:14.079> polisher

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
two polishes you use the rotary polisher

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.789 
two polishes you use the rotary polisher
and<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:16.090> grade<00:03:16.480> s<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:17.079> actually<00:03:17.410> use<00:03:17.560> what's

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
and the grade s you actually use what's

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.300 
and the grade s you actually use what's
called<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.069> cyclo<00:03:18.670> model<00:03:19.090> v<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.440> that's<00:03:21.099> this

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
called the cyclo model v and that's this

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.170 
called the cyclo model v and that's this
tool<00:03:21.579> here<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.169> a<00:03:23.430> very<00:03:24.430> specific<00:03:24.760> tool

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
tool here this is a very specific tool

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.819 
tool here this is a very specific tool
you<00:03:25.359> can't<00:03:25.569> use<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.930> much<00:03:26.139> else<00:03:26.169> besides

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
you can't use it for much else besides

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.000 
you can't use it for much else besides
polishing<00:03:27.540> Airstream<00:03:28.540> trailers<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.889> a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
polishing Airstream trailers it's a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.440 
polishing Airstream trailers it's a
shiny<00:03:30.250> sexy<00:03:31.000> tool<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.430> concept<00:03:34.150> here<00:03:34.209> is

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
shiny sexy tool and the concept here is

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.360 
shiny sexy tool and the concept here is
that<00:03:34.629> both<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.840> these<00:03:35.110> heads

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
that both of these heads

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.360 
that both of these heads
rotate<00:03:37.120> independently<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:38.050> one<00:03:38.200> another<00:03:38.370> you

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
rotate independently of one another you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.370 
rotate independently of one another you
can<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:39.760> there<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:40.780> creates<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
can see there and this creates a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.520 
can see there and this creates a
completely<00:03:41.800> random<00:03:42.489> orbital<00:03:42.910> movement<00:03:43.690> so

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
completely random orbital movement so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.820 
completely random orbital movement so
you<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:45.209> no<00:03:46.209> swirl<00:03:46.630> marks<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.260> gets<00:03:47.590> out

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
you have no swirl marks this gets out

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.460 
you have no swirl marks this gets out
all<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.790> very<00:03:49.270> light<00:03:49.599> scratches<00:03:50.319> and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
all of the very light scratches and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.840 
all of the very light scratches and
swirls<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:51.510> grade<00:03:52.510> grade<00:03:53.380> S<00:03:53.650> or<00:03:54.100> no<00:03:54.250> grade<00:03:54.520> C

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
swirls that grade grade S or no grade C

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.620 
swirls that grade grade S or no grade C
would<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:56.100> provided<00:03:57.100> with<00:03:57.459> from<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.330> type

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
would have provided with from this type

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.830 
would have provided with from this type
of<00:03:58.660> pad<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> last<00:04:00.459> step<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:00.940> with

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
of pad so this is the last step and with

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.920 
of pad so this is the last step and with
this<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.830> generally<00:04:03.310> take<00:04:03.340> what<00:04:04.330> we<00:04:04.480> use<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
this you generally take what we use is a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.390 
this you generally take what we use is a
hundred<00:04:05.200> percent<00:04:07.050> 100<00:04:08.050> percent<00:04:08.080> cotton<00:04:08.800> cloth

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
hundred percent 100 percent cotton cloth

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.680 
hundred percent 100 percent cotton cloth
and<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.819> got<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.060> make<00:04:10.150> sure<00:04:10.330> it's<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> hundred

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
and you got to make sure it's a hundred

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.050 
and you got to make sure it's a hundred
percent<00:04:10.810> cotton<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.530> what<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.519> generally<00:04:12.700> do

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
percent cotton and what we generally do
