00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.849
 the pronouns by madame marie-eve the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.059
 pronoun represents the name or group of the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.440
 name 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 it allows not to repeat 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 for example in the dog's sentences 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 short after the cat they try to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.580
 catch him take him he replaces the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.830
 group of the name subject the dog that we 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.160
 avoid repetition the dog runs after 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 the cat the dog and that's the catch 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.829
 the conjugation pronouns there are 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 singular pronouns like I do you they or 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
 they singular and pros have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 nothing more like us you they they 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.899
 or plural it is important to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.870
 remember that the pronouns of conjugation 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 still occupies the function of subjects 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 in the sentence so as I said more 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.910
 early the pronoun that replaces the group of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.730
 name in a sentence will allow 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.789
 to avoid repetition in a text 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.170
 we can replace the gn with the pronouns 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.070
 he or she singular 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.790
 he or she in the plural we are the you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 is commendable ostroff the same is and yes 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.119
 the determinants there she apostrophe 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.400
 and it sometimes disguises taking places 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.310
 the more easily unmask them they will be 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 always placed in front of a glass by 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 example the girl that a flower she the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 is the beautiful take it that is at 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 feminine he replaced the dune group at 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.619
 subject the girl who is also feminine 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 singular 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.329
 we also have the determinant the who 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 is disguised as taking and replacing 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.280

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.409

 here are some other examples my sister and me 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.810

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.890
 you and your brother did not like flowers 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 you will not go to pick 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 we notice that the pronoun always has the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.400
 same kind and the same name as the gm 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.870
