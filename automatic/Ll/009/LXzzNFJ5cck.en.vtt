00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
an economy of instruments let's look a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
an economy of instruments let's look a
little<00:01:13.860> further<00:01:15.020> well<00:01:16.020> many<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
little further well many of you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
little further well many of you
understood<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> years<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.420> Ruddell

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
understood over the years that Ruddell

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
understood over the years that Ruddell
at<00:01:19.560> least<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> last<00:01:20.130> decade<00:01:20.400> I've<00:01:21.090> been

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
at least for the last decade I've been

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
at least for the last decade I've been
out<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.570> advocating<00:01:22.049> Pro<00:01:22.920> Taper<00:01:23.159> it's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
out there advocating Pro Taper it's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.120 
out there advocating Pro Taper it's
currently<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.720> far<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.320> number<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.590> system

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
currently by far the number one system

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
currently by far the number one system
in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> world<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.420> old

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540

expression models success success leaves
clues<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.400> system<00:01:32.700> taught<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
clues so we have this system taught in

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
clues so we have this system taught in
over<00:01:33.390> 960<00:01:34.229> dental<00:01:34.890> schools<00:01:35.189> to

over 960 dental schools to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
over 960 dental schools to
undergraduates<00:01:35.820> around<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> world<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> it's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
undergraduates around the world and it's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
undergraduates around the world and it's
primarily<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> fewest<00:01:39.150> number

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
primarily because in the fewest number

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
primarily because in the fewest number
of<00:01:39.570> instruments<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> preferred

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
of instruments you can get a preferred

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
of instruments you can get a preferred
deep<00:01:41.640> shape<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> left<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.320> three

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
deep shape so on the left you see three

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
deep shape so on the left you see three
instruments<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> third<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> left

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
instruments the third one from the left

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.810 
instruments the third one from the left
is<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.619> short<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.490> when

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
is just a little short one that's when

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
is just a little short one that's when
we<00:01:47.939> looked<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.780> bit<00:01:48.869> earlier

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
we looked at just a little bit earlier

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
we looked at just a little bit earlier
remember<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.950> use<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:51.000> expand<00:01:51.509> the

remember we use that to expand the
orifice<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> begin<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> remove<00:01:53.040> triangles<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.639 
dentin that's the shapers on the left
and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> finishers<00:01:56.759> are<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> right

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.590 
and the finishers are on the right
really<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> summarize<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.610> there's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
really to summarize it all there's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.959 
really to summarize it all there's
increasing<00:02:01.259> percentage<00:02:01.860> tapers<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
shapers which means the instruments cut

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.690 
shapers which means the instruments cut
in<00:02:05.729> selective<00:02:06.390> areas<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.459> dominantly<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
in selective areas and dominantly you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
in selective areas and dominantly you
can<00:02:08.879> begin<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.420> appreciate<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.110> importance

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
can begin to appreciate the importance

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.559 
can begin to appreciate the importance

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
those shaping files

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.250 
those shaping files

today<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.590> we're<00:02:25.739> cutting<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.220> shaping

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
today so we're cutting and shaping

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.250 
today so we're cutting and shaping
immediately<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.510> upper<00:02:27.750> two-thirds<00:02:27.930> of

the<00:02:28.319> canal<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.340> finishers<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.180> decreasing

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the canal the finishers have decreasing

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.259 
the canal the finishers have decreasing
percentage<00:02:31.379> tapers<00:02:31.799> because<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> ran<00:02:33.239> a

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
percentage tapers because if you ran a

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.020 
percentage tapers because if you ran a
fixed<00:02:33.690> taper<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.230> an<00:02:34.470> example<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.980> 8%<00:02:35.280> out<00:02:35.700> over

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
fixed taper as an example of 8% out over

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.610 
fixed taper as an example of 8% out over
the<00:02:36.150> active<00:02:36.480> portion<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.319> would<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.590> a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the active portion you would have a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.490 
the active portion you would have a
giant<00:02:38.099> sequoia<00:02:38.459> tree<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.360> would<00:02:39.569> be<00:02:39.780> stiff<00:02:40.170> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
giant sequoia tree it would be stiff and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
giant sequoia tree it would be stiff and
not<00:02:41.010> only<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:41.579> stiff<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.150> would<00:02:42.299> blow

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
not only would it be stiff it would blow

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.839 
not only would it be stiff it would blow
out<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.750> lot<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.110> roots<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.890> by<00:02:44.099> decreasing<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
out a lot of roots so by decreasing the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.940 
out a lot of roots so by decreasing the
percentage<00:02:45.329> taper<00:02:45.599> two<00:02:46.230> important<00:02:46.739> things

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
percentage taper two important things

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.850 
percentage taper two important things
happen<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.849> increase<00:02:48.269> flexibility<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.379> we

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
happen we increase flexibility and we

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.539 
happen we increase flexibility and we
conserve<00:02:50.430> precious<00:02:51.329> lateral<00:02:52.290> dentin<00:02:52.680> that's

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
conserve precious lateral dentin that's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.970 
conserve precious lateral dentin that's
Pro<00:02:53.879> Taper<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.930> if<00:02:55.049> we<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.410> looked<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.799> it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
Pro Taper so if we just looked at it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.720 
Pro Taper so if we just looked at it
briefly<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.150> clinical<00:02:57.599> op<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:59.340> could<00:02:59.519> just

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
briefly in a clinical op we could just

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.849 
briefly in a clinical op we could just
see<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> shaper<00:03:00.450> coming<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:00.930> here<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> want

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
see a shaper coming in here but I want

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.180 
see a shaper coming in here but I want
to<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.099> emphasize<00:03:02.750> brushing<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.890> tell

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
to really emphasize brushing you tell

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.619 
to really emphasize brushing you tell
brushing<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> masses<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.599> masses

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
brushing to the masses and the masses

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.539 
brushing to the masses and the masses
are<00:03:07.230> now<00:03:07.530> they're<00:03:07.680> doing<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.069> brushing

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
are now they're doing a little brushing

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.400 
are now they're doing a little brushing
