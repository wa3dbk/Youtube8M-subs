00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
experiment we will be measuring leg

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.120 
experiment we will be measuring leg
created<00:00:06.420> by<00:00:06.569> zombies<00:00:07.020> so<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> five<00:00:07.950> by

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
other spot as close as that one now I've

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
other spot as close as that one now I've
also<00:00:20.160> built<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.789> leg<00:00:20.970> measuring<00:00:21.449> system<00:00:22.020> those

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
also built a leg measuring system those

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
also built a leg measuring system those
two<00:00:22.590> zombies<00:00:22.830> circulating<00:00:23.789> should<00:00:24.180> serve

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
two zombies circulating should serve

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.710 
two zombies circulating should serve
that<00:00:24.810> purpose<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.859> let's<00:00:26.220> fill<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> pit<00:00:27.180> with

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that purpose so let's fill the pit with

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.279 
that purpose so let's fill the pit with
zombies<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.560> let's<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> right<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.019> i

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
zombies and let's see so right now i

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100 
zombies and let's see so right now i
have<00:00:31.650> 200<00:00:31.980> zombies<00:00:32.850> tracking<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.780> poor

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
have 200 zombies tracking that one poor

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590 
have 200 zombies tracking that one poor
villager<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.329> still

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
villager and you can see there is still

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
villager and you can see there is still
no<00:00:36.780> leg<00:00:37.050> even<00:00:37.410> though<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.309> no<00:00:38.700> path<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
no leg even though there is no path to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.799 
no leg even though there is no path to
him<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> lake<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.280> appear<00:00:41.820> pretty<00:00:42.300> soon

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
him but the lake will appear pretty soon

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.799 
him but the lake will appear pretty soon
i<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.040> flip<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.000> lever<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
i just need to flip this lever and that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.590 
i just need to flip this lever and that
leg<00:00:46.350> should<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.680> enormous<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.030> let's<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
leg should be enormous so let's do it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
leg should be enormous so let's do it
and<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.350> mobs<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.860> stopped<00:00:50.489> interesting

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and the mobs are stopped interesting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.110 
and the mobs are stopped interesting
like<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.140> movie<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.370> i<00:00:53.610> just

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
like in some movie it is because i just

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.139 
like in some movie it is because i just
moved<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.840> block<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.800> dead<00:00:56.190> opened<00:00:56.760> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
moved this block and dead opened this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
moved this block and dead opened this
bit<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.690> outside<00:00:58.230> world<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.489> now<00:00:59.699> every<00:01:00.180> zombie

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
bit to outside world so now every zombie

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.619 
bit to outside world so now every zombie
is<00:01:00.840> trying<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.010> path<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.760> testing

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is trying to find a path and testing

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.620 
is trying to find a path and testing
about<00:01:04.040> 20,000<00:01:05.040> blocks<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.549> before<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
about 20,000 blocks around before it was

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
about 20,000 blocks around before it was
just<00:01:06.930> 26<00:01:07.500> blocks<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> huge

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
just 26 blocks so there is a huge

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899 
just 26 blocks so there is a huge
difference<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> leg<00:01:11.400> machine

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
difference and that is the leg machine

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.750 
difference and that is the leg machine
we<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.150> flip<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.720> again<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.340> game<00:01:14.549> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
we can flip it again and the game is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149 
we can flip it again and the game is
over<00:01:14.909> compensated<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> moment<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.950> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
over compensated for a moment and now it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.050 
over compensated for a moment and now it
is<00:01:17.189> ok<00:01:18.020> also<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.439> forget<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
is ok also don't forget that if there is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.640 
is ok also don't forget that if there is
no<00:01:21.390> path<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.790> AI<00:01:24.060> needs<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.960> calculate

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
no path then the AI needs to calculate

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.749 
no path then the AI needs to calculate
the<00:01:26.060> closest<00:01:27.060> block<00:01:27.450> from<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.799> 20,000

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the closest block from all those 20,000

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
the closest block from all those 20,000
blocks<00:01:30.030> around<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.560> need<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.100> square

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
blocks around for that you need a square

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230 
blocks around for that you need a square
root<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.630> things<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> why

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
root and things like that so that is why

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.440 
root and things like that so that is why
there<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.110> leg<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> final<00:01:39.150> lesson

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
there is so much leg so the final lesson

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.109 
there is so much leg so the final lesson
is<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> zombie<00:01:41.490> tracking<00:01:41.970> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
is if you have a zombie tracking a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.679 
is if you have a zombie tracking a
villager<00:01:42.630> without<00:01:43.380> any<00:01:43.680> path<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.700> him<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
villager without any path to him it is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.830 
villager without any path to him it is
ok<00:01:46.170> only<00:01:46.860> when<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.240> potential

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
ok only when there is not much potential

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.929 
ok only when there is not much potential
space<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.729> zombie<00:01:51.540> could<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.939> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
space where that zombie could go and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.340 
space where that zombie could go and
let's<00:01:54.720> finish<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.380> video<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> barbecue

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
let's finish this video with a barbecue

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.560 
let's finish this video with a barbecue
by<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.409> way<00:01:58.740> I've<00:01:59.040> created<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.759> video<00:02:00.000> also

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
by the way I've created this video also

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.590 
by the way I've created this video also
because<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:02.009> will<00:02:02.280> need<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.820> knowledge<00:02:03.149> for

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
because we will need this knowledge for

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.520 
because we will need this knowledge for
the<00:02:03.719> next<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.640> change<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:07.020> known

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the next one so I will change that known

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.690 
the next one so I will change that known
phrase<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:09.569> am<00:02:09.720> saying<00:02:10.140> try<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.670> home

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
phrase and I am saying try this at home

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820
