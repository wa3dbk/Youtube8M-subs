00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.370
 3 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.660
 with more hindsight but I do not have 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.320
 written in my cave simply 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.810
 so I curtains and I put some 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.240
 time to try to go out several 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.070
 facets in the sense that for me the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.930
 prince the prince and takes it under 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.280
 many facets 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.199
 we can find this Prince side 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.180
 charming in a piece like yours or 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.739
 a manor find the prince of 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 darkness in a piece like room 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.269
 1408 the prince of arabia in unitaid is 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.320
 so here is he so in the gift 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.120
 that it took me a long time to 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.250
 do not kill those who are 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.729
 look like I have a piece like 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.690
 in May the month that is two years old so that's it 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.690
 who is she because all I had 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.650
 already already prepared and so it's a bit 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.510
 the skeleton of my album 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.119
 it was the first piece I had 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.810
 then here it was necessary to add some 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.890
 the subject so I traveled a lot 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 to have some inspiration 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 it's true that when traveling these are 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:21.549
 minds open up and we brought to write 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.549
 things new things 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.789
 after the numbers because I want 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.469
 to say it's not too much what worries this 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.630
 that really worries me is that this 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.799
 album especially like that I put 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.189
 as it says I took a long time to 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 go out 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.280
 I really worked a lot beyond 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.289
 beyond writing I put myself 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.299
 to work a lot with the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.450
 composers reported lines 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 melodic so to make the compo 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.840
 realize some certain some 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.259
 pieces write synopses for the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.020
 clips 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.020
 I got myself I devoted myself a lot 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.179
 in a balm style during this lady 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.179
 during the year the year 2013 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510
 oh no no it's done of course it's 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.549
 artistic 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.630
 I try to com thursday in the song on 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.709
 Prince I would like to touch the horizon 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.129
 try to always go the furthest 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.200
 possible in my tracks and for the 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.200
 I think it's successful 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.630
 everyone works each one works his 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690
 artistic in itself because I want 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.710
 say after this I would say well 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.270
 crim he just signed so voice him 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.660
 he is the brother after a lot 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.740
 of artists but here we stay 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.600
 same team but at home 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.540
 finally for me david leg it stays 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.580
 that's still a team it's not 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.970
 artists stuck it's a team it's 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.590
 the team on the web a team 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.610
 that's it for the press so it's people 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:20.180
 we do not necessarily see 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:22.970
 and for me it's ed viable ben it's a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.780
 label that I have and that I have mounted for 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.660
 give the younger ones a chance 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:35.030
 and it's about discovering new 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.890
 talents and not necessarily rap 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
 what music for me as long as there is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.880
 talent and that person 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.910
 humanly be respectable and 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.489
 respectful I think we have all 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.250
 ways to get along and in fact it's the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:04:01.580
 label that I would have liked to meet and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:03.739
 well said modesty in all humility 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.980
 I would say the many months most 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.380
 youth 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.810
 I think Wallace as I say me 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.860
 I I'd like to do I would like 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.760
 round the services we could not get 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.070
 to return is a kid like that you know ah 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.359
 it's clear that at 16 if someone 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.500
 came to see me and signed me in 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.840
 record house he would not have had the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.370
 same course will not be gone I would be 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.470
 surely not gone through the prison cell at 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.470
 repeatedly for the agreement 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.800
 already the job of manager in 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.810
 frankly it does not interest me 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.410
 to complicate the hard ones it's hard to it's 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.280
 hard to handle 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.720
 everyone's artistic then went 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.480
 buy views on youtube all that you 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.890
 know I see the jetty of cigarettes at home 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.330
 aural bought here to sell 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.280
 clothes things are thrown goals 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.620
 had often I hear these stories 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.460
 buy villas throw views i 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.050
 do not know people see what they 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.670
 buy faithful shop views 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.620
 I would like to buy me manager to buy no 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:14.550
 but yeah no for me balloon after you 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.380
 cheats so in fact nessbeal sirem 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.750
 last I had invited him before he 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.380
 stop the music before it takes 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.840
 only small break 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.540
 so after that here's me the piece he was 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.250
 already there so I go out on mdrd 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.920
 even people did not understand 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.790
 I explained that this is this piece 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.730
 had not been done on the day of the 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.880
 out of modern is so here for the 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:41.390
 blow I had echoes that came back in 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.530
 rap via dj kore and dj bellek and 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.700
 I asked him to come 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.680
 ask on piece 11 43 he has he has 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.480
 evolved accept it he loved the concept 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.040
 walrus itself is not chorus 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.370
 it's a piece that lasts 15 minutes 43 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.080
 on which although beautiful people and in 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.940
 same time and explained to me that this is 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.730
 well two birds will be announced 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.730
 his return exactly 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.390
 me already I would say it's wrong I 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.070
 not think that's stupid is not 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.630
 mediatized or that is under publicized 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.310
 compared to others personally when 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.840
 I see there when I see the emissions at 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.910
 TV I do not tell you that am all 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.470
 days in front of my TV either but when 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.640
 I go back and I watch TV I 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.170
 see anyway rappers we are 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.490
 many guests 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.680
 when I watch movies at the movies 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.110
 houssin the end at the end of the movie the bo 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.030
 it's often rap started 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.470
 pose as a victim of us not invite us 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.060
 we do not take seriously I think that 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.730
 me it's not at all what I see 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.560
 what is the proof when we really 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.720
 we invited ben perso me I was 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.920
 invited a big newspaper at ruquier's 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.660
 this is the night maybe belongs to us 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.110
 maybe maybe there's a lot 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.130
 who also refuses French not but for 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.090
 me for once often when I 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.630
 watch shows I see 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.630
 rappers added 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.030
 yes but now it's more complicated 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.590
 because they are a lot to turn 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.990
 I am on my projects too they 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.759
 have theirs but here is a chrome giro 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.750
 good if you want an excluded you go 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:18.750
 find in the sea 3
