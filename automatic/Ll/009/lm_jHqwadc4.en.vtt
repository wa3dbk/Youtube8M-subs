their silver reports and you so let's
look<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.289> thomson<00:00:16.740> reuters<00:00:17.039> GF<00:00:17.460> ms<00:00:17.730> findings

look at thomson reuters GF ms findings

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.050 
look at thomson reuters GF ms findings
and<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.930> seems<00:00:19.109> 2014<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> good<00:00:20.580> year<00:00:20.609> for

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and it seems 2014 was a good year for

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.750 
and it seems 2014 was a good year for
the<00:00:21.180> metal<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> terms<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.930> physical<00:00:22.080> demand

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
the metal in terms of physical demand

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
the metal in terms of physical demand
yeah<00:00:23.760> i<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.199> certainly<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.619> what

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
yeah i think certainly you know what

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
yeah i think certainly you know what
prices<00:00:26.130> declined<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.090> you've<00:00:27.240> seen<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
prices declined what you've seen is the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.339 
prices declined what you've seen is the
demand<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:28.890> held<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.490> pretty<00:00:29.670> well<00:00:30.349> there

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
demand side held up pretty well there

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
demand side held up pretty well there
was<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> four<00:00:32.279> percent<00:00:32.640> decline<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.420> demand<00:00:33.750> but

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
was a four percent decline in demand but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.840 
was a four percent decline in demand but
there's<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.770> better<00:00:34.950> than<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> seen<00:00:35.579> in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
there's a lot better than you seen in

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
there's a lot better than you seen in
other<00:00:36.210> commodities<00:00:36.840> certainly<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.739> better

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
other commodities certainly a lot better

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.830 
other commodities certainly a lot better
than<00:00:38.160> you've<00:00:38.280> seen<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> gold<00:00:39.000> sector<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
than you've seen in the gold sector and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
than you've seen in the gold sector and
at<00:00:40.770> almost<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.940> due<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
at almost all of that was due to a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.889 
at almost all of that was due to a
decline<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.930> coin<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> bar<00:00:44.250> demand<00:00:44.899> from

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
decline in coin and bar demand from

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.190 
decline in coin and bar demand from
record<00:00:46.320> levels<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.300> 2013<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.870> also<00:00:49.020> saw

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
record levels in in 2013 and we also saw

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
record levels in in 2013 and we also saw
an<00:00:49.260> uptick<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.590> jewelry<00:00:50.010> demand<00:00:50.340> due<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> those

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
an uptick in jewelry demand due to those

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
an uptick in jewelry demand due to those
lower<00:00:51.270> prices<00:00:51.750> yeah<00:00:52.199> juhi<00:00:52.530> demand<00:00:52.920> increased

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
lower prices yeah juhi demand increased

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
lower prices yeah juhi demand increased
by<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.140> point<00:00:55.350> five<00:00:55.649> percent<00:00:56.129> last

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
by about one point five percent last

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
by about one point five percent last
year<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
year and it would have actually been a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
year and it would have actually been a
lot<00:00:58.230> higher<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.100> but<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> saw<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> big

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
lot higher than that but we saw a big

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
lot higher than that but we saw a big
decline<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.320> chinese<00:01:01.800> demand<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.460> jewelry

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
decline in chinese demand for jewelry

stock levels they've been built up in

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
stock levels they've been built up in
the<00:01:20.850> previous<00:01:21.180> year<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> 2014<00:01:22.590> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the previous year now in 2014 we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
the previous year now in 2014 we
obviously<00:01:22.799> saw<00:01:23.100> silver<00:01:23.580> prices<00:01:23.820> really

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
obviously saw silver prices really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
obviously saw silver prices really
struggling<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.960> since<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> start<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.650> 2015

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
struggling but since the start of 2015

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
struggling but since the start of 2015
we've<00:01:26.369> seen<00:01:26.610> silver<00:01:26.880> prices<00:01:27.150> pick<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
we've seen silver prices pick up and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
we've seen silver prices pick up and
more<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> line<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.100> gold<00:01:29.490> yeah<00:01:29.939> sent<00:01:30.329> me

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
more in line with gold yeah sent me

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
more in line with gold yeah sent me
since<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> beginning<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.380> year's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
since the beginning of this year's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.020 
since the beginning of this year's
always<00:01:31.950> been<00:01:32.130> performing<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:32.909> bit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
always been performing a little bit

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
always been performing a little bit
better<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.570> think<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.680> partly<00:01:34.979> because<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
better I think that's partly because it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.319 
better I think that's partly because it
overshot<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> downside<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.680> 24<00:01:38.610> 14<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
overshot to the downside in 24 14 and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.050 
overshot to the downside in 24 14 and
been<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.530> forward<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.670> expect

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
been going forward we would expect

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
been going forward we would expect
silver<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.840> perhaps<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.950> gold<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.430> little

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
silver to perhaps out for gold a little

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.450 
silver to perhaps out for gold a little
over<00:01:44.970> them<00:01:45.149> before<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.229> year<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> know

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
over them before this year and you know

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
over them before this year and you know
that's<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.909> also<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.509> we're<00:01:48.689> seeing<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that's that's also what we're seeing a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
that's that's also what we're seeing a
lot<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.320> investors<00:01:49.920> positioning<00:01:50.640> themselves

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
lot of investors positioning themselves

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
lot of investors positioning themselves
to<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.409> look<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.860> example<00:01:52.920> with

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to do if you look for example with

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630 
to do if you look for example with
silver<00:01:54.450> ETF<00:01:54.869> holdings<00:01:55.439> they've<00:01:56.070> maintained

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
silver ETF holdings they've maintained

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
silver ETF holdings they've maintained
their<00:01:56.939> very<00:01:57.149> high<00:01:57.420> historical<00:01:58.110> levels<00:01:58.469> they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
their very high historical levels they

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
their very high historical levels they
haven't<00:01:59.009> come<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.430> whereas<00:01:59.790> gold<00:02:00.060> ETF

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
haven't come down whereas gold ETF

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230 
haven't come down whereas gold ETF
holdings<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.729> lot

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
holdings have and I think that's a lot

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
holdings have and I think that's a lot
of<00:02:03.270> investors<00:02:03.869> who<00:02:04.049> want<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.290> position

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
of investors who want to position

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
of investors who want to position
themselves<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.369> potential<00:02:06.210> precious<00:02:06.570> metals

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
themselves for potential precious metals

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.440 
themselves for potential precious metals
rally<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.160> silver<00:02:08.610> will<00:02:08.819> historically

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
rally know that silver will historically

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
rally know that silver will historically
outperform<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:10.770> silver<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
outperform so do you think silver is a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.970 
outperform so do you think silver is a
better<00:02:11.520> bet<00:02:11.760> than<00:02:11.819> gold<00:02:12.239> right<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
better bet than gold right now and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910 
better bet than gold right now and
or<00:02:14.400> our<00:02:14.849> forecast<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.510> don't<00:02:16.050> say<00:02:16.319> yes<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
or our forecast I don't say yes at the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.430 
or our forecast I don't say yes at the
moment<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.819> because<00:02:18.239> it's<00:02:18.690> more<00:02:18.930> volatile

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
moment just because it's more volatile

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.619 
moment just because it's more volatile
but<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.799> said<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:21.060> know<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.599> that

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
but that said you know with that

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.449 
but that said you know with that
increased<00:02:22.140> volatility<00:02:22.590> comes<00:02:23.099> increased

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
increased volatility comes increased

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.520 
increased volatility comes increased
risk<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.269> what's<00:02:24.450> your<00:02:24.599> price<00:02:24.810> forecast<00:02:25.349> for

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
risk so what's your price forecast for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.680 
risk so what's your price forecast for
silver<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.849> in<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> short<00:02:27.180> term

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
silver and we think in the short term

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.199 
silver and we think in the short term
there's<00:02:28.019> there's<00:02:28.379> room<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.650> weakness<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
there's there's room for weakness but

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.990 
there's there's room for weakness but
overall<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.470> view<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.430> average<00:02:32.760> annual

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
overall we view the the average annual

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.770 
overall we view the the average annual
price<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.870> being<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.580> 1654<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.730> year<00:02:36.030> but

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
price as being at 1654 this year but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.839 
price as being at 1654 this year but
also<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> price<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.950> strengthen<00:02:38.459> towards

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
also for the price to strengthen towards

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.089 
also for the price to strengthen towards
the<00:02:39.030> end<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.420> year<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.200> we're<00:02:40.349> heading<00:02:40.920> at

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
the end of the year so we're heading at

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.180 
the end of the year so we're heading at
the<00:02:41.129> price<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.569> end<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.019> year<00:02:43.190> over

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
the price to to end the year over

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.970 
the price to to end the year over
seventeen<00:02:44.670> dollars<00:02:44.879> per<00:02:45.329> ounce<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.900> again<00:02:46.560> we

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
seventeen dollars per ounce and again we

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.490 
seventeen dollars per ounce and again we
think<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.819> 2015<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.989> be<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> lowest

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
think that the 2015 will be the lowest

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.410 
think that the 2015 will be the lowest
annual<00:02:49.860> average<00:02:50.430> further<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> next
