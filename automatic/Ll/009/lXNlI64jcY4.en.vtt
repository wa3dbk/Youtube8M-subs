00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.760
 moto good she is of course more than just 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.770
 a motorcycle moto guzzi a bit 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.470
 Of course, lifestyle is a bit 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.200
 Italy and Moto Guzzi is natural 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.590
 much more than just what you're in today 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.270
 To buy loading he does not get any plastic 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.230
 fantastic motorcycle but is one 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.230
 real creature 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:41.760
 classic café racer is slimmed down 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:47.420
 highest possible performance always narrow 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.420
 wheels classic line hour longer 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.450
 First of all, get the whole thing quickly 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.560
 all your liquid stuff when there 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.800
 removed from the room 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.149
 they always need the whole 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.900
 electrical parts such as alternators regulators 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:18.819
 Release fuses eliminate the space 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.040
 is shortened that you a sporty 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.959
 optics how to cut the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 rear strem in front of the frame 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.190
 Schneider looks and sees what that looks like 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.630
 then in the end to be out back 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.500
 again welded that frame 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.690
 is tight again 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.670
 we will weld here again 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.290
 to strive for the stability 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.450
 we back there to take out on top again 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.959
 reinbekommen the children at the same time 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.110
 then as a bench and runen distracts 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.769
 stop and various other small parts 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.290
 are still wrestling with the whole thing 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.810
 that you have a clinic optics audience 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.100
 class café racers have old doubts 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.880
 mother from the vfr builds pushes on 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.440
 rear wheel 86 ps is with engine power 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.440
 specify before 95 ps 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 animal fun to drive with the pink 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 over the highway you can do the thing 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.310
 let it fly properly 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.830
 for that, as you can see one here 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.100
 telegabel used from the 1100 sports 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.750
 with the four-piston brake system from 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.880
 brembo 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.460
 during the construction phase you are always more 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.710
 aware of this is actually a 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.710
 really cool line for today 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.590
 So that's a nice one, of course 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.490
 symbiosis from an old classic 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.750
 form without the whole 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.720
 teething of a motorcycle with 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.670
 buys something then already 20 or 30 years 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.040
 old is so i always wanted a bike 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.650
 have what is suitable for everyday life what also 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.630
 certainly fun and not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.610
 is underpowered or where the 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.860
 electrics are simply bad or one 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.990
 other faulty processing easy 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.080
 Over the years, I just wanted to 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.000
 a relatively modern bike in an old one 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.390
 and I think that is very 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.390
 well accomplished
