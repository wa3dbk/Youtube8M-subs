00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.820
 Hello everyone, today we will talk about 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 tea storage 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 there are so many different ways to guard 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 tea prize winner you need to understand what is 3 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.160
 factors that spoils tea and which 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.580
 affect its storage negative 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.830
 the way braze of all is moisture then 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.980
 have increased humidity or 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.770
 there is just some steam there is this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.610
 negative that is by no means 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.760
 there must be a wet room 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 era is it in the light indoor light for example 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 may have seen in many tea shops 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 there are tea stores in glass 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 transparent banks is absolutely 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 wrong so it goes on 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 fermentation especially stands as chuya and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.440
 tea than pour out such a spirit dry and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 like straw and very quickly deteriorates even 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.979
 if he was good then this is air then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.560
 eat if tea is stored 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.159
 open air ie open 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.990
 package 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.299
 also very quickly out of breath goes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 the aroma is again accelerated 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.119
 processes in the leaf in the tea, respectively 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 also it spoils also very important 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.850
 aspect and temperature 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.750
 storage for each tea is different but before 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 everything is important to not be too hot 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 That is, there is a cold on to a good effect on 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.759
 tea is not alone negative at least 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.090
 for two thousand so there is a moment about 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.159
 cold storage is very interesting 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.229
 what is customary in China to store the moon 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.979
 especially southern u uncle taiwan 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.350
 vacuum and therefore refrigerator in 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 Overall, so tea keeps really better 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.850
 Keeps longer so much freshness 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 as if you had just collected it 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.840
 but there is such a negative moment 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.300
 meeting after being buried in 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.780
 the fridge got him 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.370
 and supported at least rains 2 without 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 the fridge he starts very quickly 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.840
 exhale that is that way 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.670
 tea get used to some storage conditions 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.300
 dies very quickly and everyone abruptly 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.680
 change the same goes for principle and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.950
 other storage methods 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 so the best option 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.340
 tea storage 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.590
 it is stored in a special tea pot 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.910
 they are sure to be in the fridge 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 commitment to special people 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.730
 temperature conditions but with full 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 lack of light 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.290
 lack of air and with normal 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.270
 temperature rooms especially if you 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.100
 keep the tea for a short time then 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.560
 There is a month two maximum three 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.210
 nothing will happen to him in the ordinary 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.790
 household home storage without 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.550
 the main refrigerator was to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.960
 absent light conditions are met and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.180
 air and odor 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.140
 principle is enough even in ordinary 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.930
 stores for sale 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.840
 teabags to prove all beans tea all 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.410
 sell Chinese tea if you opened 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.750
 then you can seal it in the usual way 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.820
 normal clip just seal it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.180
 only satisfied did not penetrate 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.980
 and especially store will also be good 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.050
 if you put it in the bag 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.170
 special vessel for tea storage 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.410
 that is, the analysis there is more democratic 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.350
 still cheap butterfly cardboard with lid 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.630
 dense yes then there are the most caddy 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.100
 various 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.180
 day i'm such aspirations from here 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.880
 there are too pretty 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.430
 sealed then you need to pour tea and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.880
 just so that is, without a package, you can 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.320
 package when put what is good teapot 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 what is different from the can 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.690
 has itself 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.390
 quite massive such weight and porcelain it 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.040
 cool especially if than is 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.040
 not the hottest place in your home 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.690
 built on such here are some more 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.810
 additionally such narrowing is effective 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.820
 tea has some by the way store even 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.380
 if the caddy is very tightly closed and 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.320
 there is still tea 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.390
 package protector krebs and so help 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.610
 more often even the fetus does not put a feature 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.980
 there to the color st he conclusion about the protection of tiprom 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.690
 a very long time but this is not 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.730
 of necessity it is necessary to say that 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.430
 this is now 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.000
 but not excessively on quite strong 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.240
 freeze even said so because u 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.240
 i'm great for example green tea in 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.720
 the usual bag and lay 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.120
 just at home and was maybe not 108 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.370
 just lay then I drank I didn't even 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.470
 noticed especially the seeds of difference may 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.320
 wet so that tea was good good tea 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.380
 then respectively, and longer stored 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.420
 have all its properties last longer 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.640
 there is as well as good tea better 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.530
 brews more brewing soak 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.710
 also he to storage 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.230
 mini 4 here again depends on 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.030
 sorts we completion meant almost 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.330
 which over time become only 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.130
 better that is the same qr for example yes that 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.110
 there is he just in the form that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.500
 manufactured without any additional 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.720
 packaging there just can store at home 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.030
 on the bookshelf 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.810
 and over the years will acquire just 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.810
 only new properties
