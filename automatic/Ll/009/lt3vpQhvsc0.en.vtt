00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.610 
said we don't even want a nuclear weapon
and<00:02:39.109> his<00:02:40.069> reasoning<00:02:40.639> is<00:02:40.819> well<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:42.049> know<00:02:42.319> that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and his reasoning is well we know that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.319 
and his reasoning is well we know that
that<00:02:42.709> would<00:02:42.889> provoke<00:02:43.189> America<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:43.790> attack<00:02:44.090> us

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
that would provoke America to attack us

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.789 
that would provoke America to attack us
and<00:02:44.480> they<00:02:44.689> wanted<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.019> attack<00:02:45.379> us<00:02:45.560> for<00:02:45.709> the

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and they wanted to attack us for the

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.080 
and they wanted to attack us for the
longest<00:02:46.010> time<00:02:46.219> so<00:02:46.609> we<00:02:46.700> don't<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.939> to<00:02:47.000> give

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
longest time so we don't want to give

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.610 
longest time so we don't want to give
them<00:02:47.239> any<00:02:47.389> reason<00:02:47.480> whatsoever<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.290> want<00:02:48.530> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
them any reason whatsoever to want to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.800 
them any reason whatsoever to want to
attack<00:02:48.859> us<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.280> we<00:02:50.090> don't<00:02:50.209> want<00:02:50.419> a<00:02:50.480> nuclear

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
