00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.520
 am boxing yes i have post again 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 got it from nintendo i can 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.310
 I think well what is inside but 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.310
 we look as though once purely 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:34.650
 moment yes I 've already thought it 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 is lego city undercover for the 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.420
 nintendo wii u i have asked for them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.699
 to send me something to test 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.030
 and I am very happy that it worked 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.309
 thank you at this point again we 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.839
 have the limited edition of lego here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 city undercover the whole thing is from 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.089
 nintendo i think cooperate too 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.610
 a british developer company tt 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.610
 games I think yes would have to be right 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.070
 believes title games have developed with it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.369
 and yes we look at the whole thing 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.320
 participants in the design 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.020
 I think the box pretty much 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.109
 cool 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 Here you can see chase merkel with the 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.780
 criminal ex wife and a little text 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.429
 I can always read that to you 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.350
 Investigate covertly as officer James 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.409
 mccann and uses yours 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.399
 ultimate detective an ultimate 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.259
 effectively tool the video game pad yes 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.130
 you can do many with the gamepad 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.979
 to do things 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.539
 I know that there is such a scanner 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.329
 then you can really use it like that 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.960
 scanned the whole area and much 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.240
 much more 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 the game is about her 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.149
 says this main character James Mackay and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.719
 chase the criminal rex fury that is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.999
 the colleague up there a lot 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.990
 crime is done in the city and 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:02.939
 you're just hunting for him after all 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.350
 pretty good story and how that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.270
 will expire whole I am also very 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.869
 curious I can also predominantly 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869
 only the trailer 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.560
 and hereby the game beats it all 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.170
 talk down so 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.150
 yes , now the figure on so 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.959
 a huge piece of paper for such a 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 very small figure of that we here so 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.500
 unpacking 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 I build the whole time together with 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:03:01.850
 the film so still he hage her right 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 around like I think that because he sees 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:10.880
 from when the camera would make sharp 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.620
 james mackay miracles beautiful here 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.190
 playing video looks the same from behind 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.660
 like on the packaging is a 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:27.980
 So player is not a multiplayer game 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.900
 a bit a pity the carton me 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.480
 can now go away because I am fully on 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.720
 the kinks safety instructions the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.220
 you do not need to read aloud 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.239
 the foreign country is I think it actually 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.620
 pretty cool looks smart has something 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.709
 one used that which one also 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.610
 So I could use that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.769
 cover pretty well 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.430
 and how to defend view of the booklet 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.430
 page 7 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.470
 Let's take a quick look through here 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.489
 So you see you made a lot 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.380
 with the gamepad 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.570
 I'll probably be there too 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.830
 a little hard to do because you are 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.630
 can do so much with it 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.250
 here are tailors for example, couple 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.640
 things you have a card on it a gps 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.850
 Video calls can be received there 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.670
 data scanner audio scanner and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.480
 camera function they are still like that 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:39.790
 ready example pictures really 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:43.450
 set customer and that's it 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.920
 that's all right, so you have one 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.920
 only the page here with the whole 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.480
 functions yes as I said I will 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.490
 the same time will start the whole time 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.960
 Antesten look like it now more 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.080
 so really like if I now in 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.210
 the hand has as said my first 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.480
 impression of the game is super awesome 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.970
 much joke and humor as I've heard 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.880
 also some movies that are parodied 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.040
 be in the game 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.410
 yes, I'm really looking forward to it 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.290
 me to finally play it 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.730
 and that 's it with the unboxing 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.260
 if you have got it for you and also 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.710
 already played or it 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.060
 is thursday from you can like 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.590
 your opinion in the comments 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.720
 Write what you have from a play 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.060
 So I'm really excited so far 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.540
 and looking forward to it so in this 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.950
 senses 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.100
 See you next time 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.540
 a lot of fun and skin falls in there 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.550
 I still a very small thing a 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.830
 some have in the last video 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.380
 you like to write this 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.770
 I want to see lego figures built up 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.100
 had last time package in advance 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.480
 got to the lego kit yes so 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.440
 It looks like I have it 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.669
 cobbled together and yes there is me 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.530
 first noticed as correctly as 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.790
 Annoying this is this sticker 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.610
 I had all that to do 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.530
 Forgot me much work cost 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.750
 that reasonably nice and straight 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.520
 hinzukriegen 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.620
 and the quality I'm very 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.210
 excited I can recommend to anyone because 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.270
 really nothing has changed in the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.700
 It's pretty cool all year round 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.320
 the design of the car so without joke the 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.040
 have the really well implemented the 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.009
 Lego designer really first-rate 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.770
 I have to say that I have to work 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.089
 yes those were the things that I still have 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.490
 Show times wanted because some have 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:30.779
 demand 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.419
 in another parquet also james 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.849
 mackay again now I have 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.740
 maybe two of them because I 'm fine 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.729
 imagine that I might one call 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.099
 if you decide to give away lego city 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.689
 undercover does not catch but still so 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.830
 want a little jason cain 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:48.869
 maybe I'll give away 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.849
 I think there's a fine from 

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:55.039
 and that was it really we see 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.039
 us next time and go inside
