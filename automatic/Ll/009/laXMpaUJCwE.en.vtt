how you want to seal off the ends so on

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.260 
how you want to seal off the ends so on
this<00:04:36.440> sealer<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:37.040> have<00:04:37.310> two<00:04:37.580> different<00:04:38.060> size

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
this sealer I have two different size

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.960 
this sealer I have two different size
holes<00:04:38.630> one<00:04:39.020> for<00:04:39.320> large<00:04:39.560> braids<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.190> one<00:04:40.700> for

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
holes one for large braids and one for

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.060 
holes one for large braids and one for
small<00:04:41.270> braids<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:42.200> use<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.620> seal<00:04:42.889> the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
small braids that I can use to seal the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.670 
small braids that I can use to seal the
ends<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:43.970> whichever<00:04:44.210> applies<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.229> can<00:04:45.470> go

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
ends so whichever applies you can go

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.040 
ends so whichever applies you can go
ahead<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.250> squeeze<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.120> braid<00:04:47.389> into<00:04:47.690> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
ahead and squeeze the braid into the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.409 
ahead and squeeze the braid into the
opening<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.710> your<00:04:48.740> sealer<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:50.120> I'm<00:04:50.180> going<00:04:50.360> to

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
opening of your sealer so I'm going to

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.320 
opening of your sealer so I'm going to
grab<00:04:50.690> my<00:04:50.930> first<00:04:51.260> braid<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.919> my<00:04:52.729> sealer<00:04:53.090> is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
grab my first braid and my sealer is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.140 
grab my first braid and my sealer is
already<00:04:53.840> hot<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.400> I'm<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.760> lift<00:04:55.940> up<00:04:56.120> my

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
already hot so I'm going to lift up my

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.030 
already hot so I'm going to lift up my
braid<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.870> I'm<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:57.290> going<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.590> go<00:04:57.740> up<00:04:57.919> a

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
braid and I'm just going to go up a

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.980 
braid and I'm just going to go up a
couple<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.550> inches<00:04:58.790> from<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.360> bottom<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.870> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
couple of inches from the bottom of the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.730 
couple of inches from the bottom of the
braid<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.440> pinch<00:05:00.889> it<00:05:01.100> with<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.460> sealer<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.680> I

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
braid and pinch it with the sealer so I

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.650 
braid and pinch it with the sealer so I
insert<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.400> into<00:05:04.550> this<00:05:04.880> cone-shaped

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
insert it into this cone-shaped

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.700 
insert it into this cone-shaped
opening<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:07.460> pinch<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.970> braid<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.710> now

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
opening and I pinch the braid and now

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.719 
opening and I pinch the braid and now
it's<00:05:09.919> already<00:05:10.370> sealed<00:05:11.440> this<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:12.680> much<00:05:13.430> better

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
it's already sealed this is much better

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.719 
it's already sealed this is much better
than<00:05:14.120> using<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.780> lighter<00:05:15.110> or<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.890> candle<00:05:16.520> lighter

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
than using a lighter or a candle lighter

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.210 
than using a lighter or a candle lighter
because<00:05:17.330> when<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.930> do<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.289> most<00:05:18.650> times<00:05:18.890> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
because when you do that most times the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.850 
because when you do that most times the
flames<00:05:19.520> shoot<00:05:20.150> up<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.600> hair<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.080> that's<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
flames shoot up the hair and that's the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.310 
flames shoot up the hair and that's the
possibility<00:05:22.669> of<00:05:22.700> burning<00:05:23.240> yourself<00:05:23.450> or<00:05:23.990> your

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
possibility of burning yourself or your

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.680 
possibility of burning yourself or your
hair<00:05:24.590> or<00:05:24.620> your<00:05:25.070> scalp<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.240> must<00:05:26.570> be

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
hair or your scalp so you must be

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.570 
hair or your scalp so you must be
careful<00:05:27.200> when<00:05:27.380> you're<00:05:27.470> doing<00:05:27.530> with<00:05:27.979> any<00:05:28.250> Hot

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
careful when you're doing with any Hot

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.029 
careful when you're doing with any Hot
Tools<00:05:28.940> even<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.900> sealer<00:05:30.200> because<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.830> could

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
Tools even the sealer because you could

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.740 
Tools even the sealer because you could
potentially<00:05:31.160> burn<00:05:31.880> yourself<00:05:32.390> if<00:05:32.510> you're<00:05:32.720> not

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
potentially burn yourself if you're not

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.650 
potentially burn yourself if you're not
careful<00:05:33.320> but<00:05:34.190> this<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:34.640> great<00:05:34.880> because<00:05:35.120> there

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
careful but this is great because there

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.560 
careful but this is great because there
is<00:05:35.780> no<00:05:35.990> fire<00:05:36.380> or<00:05:36.710> flames<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.610> simply<00:05:38.330> just

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
is no fire or flames it simply just

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.650 
is no fire or flames it simply just
melts<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.080> fibers<00:05:39.530> of<00:05:39.650> your<00:05:39.740> hair<00:05:40.580> so<00:05:41.419> right

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
melts the fibers of your hair so right

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.180 
melts the fibers of your hair so right
now<00:05:41.870> I'm<00:05:41.960> going<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.169> grab<00:05:42.410> another<00:05:42.440> one<00:05:42.860> and

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
now I'm going to grab another one and

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.370 
now I'm going to grab another one and
show<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.430> how<00:05:43.760> easy<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:44.750> use<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.960> braid

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
show you how easy it is to use a braid

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.190 
show you how easy it is to use a braid
sealer<00:05:46.120> so<00:05:47.120> I'm<00:05:47.180> going<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.390> lift<00:05:47.570> on<00:05:47.750> my<00:05:47.900> braid

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
sealer so I'm going to lift on my braid

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.230 
sealer so I'm going to lift on my braid
and<00:05:48.770> I'm<00:05:48.919> simply<00:05:49.220> going<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.580> go<00:05:49.700> up<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:50.000> couple

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
and I'm simply going to go up a couple

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.210 
and I'm simply going to go up a couple
of<00:05:50.450> inches<00:05:50.600> from<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.050> bottom<00:05:51.229> I'm<00:05:51.650> going<00:05:52.130> to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
of inches from the bottom I'm going to

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.320 
of inches from the bottom I'm going to
pinch<00:05:52.520> off<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:52.910> braid

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
pinch off the braid

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.080 
pinch off the braid
and<00:05:55.330> now<00:05:56.170> my<00:05:56.380> braid<00:05:56.650> has<00:05:56.860> been<00:05:57.130> sealed

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.870 

in<00:06:02.050> this<00:06:02.380> step<00:06:02.680> I<00:06:02.860> have<00:06:02.889> shown<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:03.639> how<00:06:03.850> to

in this step I have shown you how to

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.940 
in this step I have shown you how to
seal<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.540> ends<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:05.020> your<00:06:05.260> single<00:06:05.710> braid

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
seal the ends of your single braid

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.909

extensions<00:06:06.639> first<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.630> showed<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.230> by<00:06:08.410> simply

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
extensions first I showed you by simply

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.490 
extensions first I showed you by simply
dipping<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.460> ends<00:06:09.880> of<00:06:10.000> my<00:06:10.330> braids<00:06:10.690> into<00:06:11.200> hot

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500

water then I showed you a second method

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.640 
water then I showed you a second method
by<00:06:14.770> simply<00:06:15.310> using<00:06:15.730> a<00:06:15.880> braid<00:06:16.180> sealer<00:06:16.480> in<00:06:16.870> the
