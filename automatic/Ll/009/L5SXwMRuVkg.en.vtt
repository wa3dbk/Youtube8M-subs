the playoffs they're dangerous and
that's<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:26.480> reason<00:02:26.689> I<00:02:26.930> wasn't<00:02:27.170> ready<00:02:27.499> to<00:02:27.590> give

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769

that's the reason I wasn't ready to give
up<00:02:27.829> on<00:02:28.189> them<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.639> think<00:02:29.120> they're<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.299> little<00:02:29.510> bit

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
up on them I think they're a little bit

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.539 
up on them I think they're a little bit
overrated<00:02:29.989> guys<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.859> you<00:02:31.069> know<00:02:31.129> Pierre

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
overrated guys like you know Pierre

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.819 
overrated guys like you know Pierre
skies<00:02:31.969> like<00:02:32.239> Garnett<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.959> know<00:02:33.079> they're<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
skies like Garnett you know they're the

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.270 
skies like Garnett you know they're the
twilight<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> their<00:02:34.549> careers<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.989> i<00:02:36.590> just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
twilight of their careers but i just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.399 
twilight of their careers but i just
think<00:02:37.400> against<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.849> team<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.090> Atlanta<00:02:38.900> who

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
think against a team like Atlanta who

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.929 
think against a team like Atlanta who
doesn't<00:02:39.799> have<00:02:39.919> a<00:02:39.950> deep<00:02:40.250> bench<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.790> isn't

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
doesn't have a deep bench and isn't

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.119 
doesn't have a deep bench and isn't
going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.209> able<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.450> push<00:02:41.659> them<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.200> got<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
going to be able to push them I got to

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.009 
going to be able to push them I got to
give<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> edge<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:43.669> the<00:02:44.090> Celtics<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.719> think

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
give the edge to the Celtics I think

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.599 
give the edge to the Celtics I think
they<00:02:45.169> are<00:02:45.349> for<00:02:45.590> real<00:02:45.739> i<00:02:45.799> know<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.189> disagree

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
with me but i do think they have enough

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.459 
with me but i do think they have enough

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
in the NBA you know that tells me a lot

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.780 
in the NBA you know that tells me a lot
right<00:03:11.930> there<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.739> know<00:03:12.859> Atlanta<00:03:13.280> played<00:03:13.519> us<00:03:13.669> a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
right there you know Atlanta played us a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.119 
right there you know Atlanta played us a
cupcake<00:03:14.329> schedule<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.680> they've<00:03:15.829> only<00:03:15.949> won

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129

one<00:03:16.459> more<00:03:16.639> game<00:03:16.849> than<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> Boston<00:03:17.509> Celtics<00:03:17.750> I

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:18.229 
one more game than the Boston Celtics I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.189 
one more game than the Boston Celtics I
just<00:03:18.799> think<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.430> Boston<00:03:20.090> gets<00:03:20.329> by<00:03:20.659> them<00:03:20.989> in

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
just think that Boston gets by them in

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.309 
just think that Boston gets by them in
this<00:03:21.439> series<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:23.049> Boston's<00:03:24.049> going<00:03:24.199> to<00:03:24.259> be

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
this series and Boston's going to be

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.080 
this series and Boston's going to be
that<00:03:24.439> one<00:03:24.590> team<00:03:24.829> not<00:03:25.159> too<00:03:25.370> many<00:03:25.459> people<00:03:25.849> teams

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
that one team not too many people teams

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.360 
that one team not too many people teams
going<00:03:26.359> to<00:03:26.449> my<00:03:26.509> face<00:03:26.780> well<00:03:27.199> I'm<00:03:27.409> look<00:03:27.769> at<00:03:28.009> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
going to my face well I'm look at I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.369 
going to my face well I'm look at I
can't<00:03:28.939> disagree<00:03:29.329> with<00:03:29.689> anything<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.139> you

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.259 
can't disagree with anything that you
said<00:03:30.620> there<00:03:30.859> I<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:31.250> think<00:03:31.849> that<00:03:31.939> that

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
said there I just think that that

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.710 
said there I just think that that
stretch<00:03:32.810> they<00:03:33.109> had<00:03:33.379> in<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.280> fact<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.759> until

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
stretch they had in the fact that until

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.689 
throw a horse racing reference you know
you<00:03:48.079> don't<00:03:48.259> want<00:03:48.500> your<00:03:48.620> horse<00:03:48.919> peaking<00:03:49.549> right

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
you don't want your horse peaking right

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.270 
you don't want your horse peaking right
and<00:03:50.479> a<00:03:50.689> wheel<00:03:50.989> reported<00:03:51.500> there<00:03:51.650> yeah<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.099> want

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
and a wheel reported there yeah you want

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.580 
and a wheel reported there yeah you want
him<00:03:52.430> peeking<00:03:52.699> for<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.870> first<00:03:54.049> Saturday<00:03:54.560> in

him peeking for the first Saturday in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.520 
him peeking for the first Saturday in
May<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.099> I'm<00:03:55.639> afraid<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.359> Celtics<00:03:56.840> that

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
May and I'm afraid that the Celtics that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.140 
May and I'm afraid that the Celtics that
the<00:03:57.709> gas<00:03:58.069> tank<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.609> be<00:03:58.699> a<00:03:58.729> little<00:03:58.969> bit

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the gas tank is going to be a little bit

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.360 
the gas tank is going to be a little bit
on<00:03:59.269> empty<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.719> i<00:03:59.810> think<00:04:00.169> this<00:04:00.769> Atlanta<00:04:01.340> team

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
on empty and i think this Atlanta team

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.459 
on empty and i think this Atlanta team
and<00:04:01.759> I<00:04:01.849> know<00:04:01.909> they<00:04:02.629> haven't<00:04:02.810> played<00:04:03.109> as<00:04:03.259> tough

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
and I know they haven't played as tough

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.899 
and I know they haven't played as tough
of<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.709> schedule<00:04:04.129> you're<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.430> hundred<00:04:04.790> percent

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
of the schedule you're a hundred percent

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.059 
of the schedule you're a hundred percent
correct<00:04:05.419> there<00:04:05.689> but<00:04:06.169> I<00:04:06.199> think<00:04:06.439> this<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.769> team

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
correct there but I think this is a team

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.229 
correct there but I think this is a team
that's<00:04:07.099> kind<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.549> flying<00:04:07.790> under<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.150> radar

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
that's kind of flying under the radar

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.020 
that's kind of flying under the radar
the<00:04:08.900> Hawks<00:04:09.169> have<00:04:09.409> made<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.769> playoffs<00:04:10.030> last

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
the Hawks have made the playoffs last

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.479 
the Hawks have made the playoffs last
several<00:04:11.359> River<00:04:11.750> yeah<00:04:12.019> in<00:04:12.319> they<00:04:12.919> just<00:04:13.189> can't

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
several River yeah in they just can't

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.759 
several River yeah in they just can't
get<00:04:13.759> over<00:04:13.939> that<00:04:14.209> huh<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.199> know<00:04:15.289> after<00:04:15.469> they

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
get over that huh you know after they

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.439 
get over that huh you know after they
get<00:04:15.919> into<00:04:16.099> that<00:04:16.250> first<00:04:16.519> round<00:04:16.729> player<00:04:17.000> they've

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
get into that first round player they've

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.390 
get into that first round player they've
given<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.810> lot<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.019> teams<00:04:18.349> fits<00:04:18.709> but<00:04:18.979> then<00:04:19.159> they

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
given a lot of teams fits but then they

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.849 
given a lot of teams fits but then they
just<00:04:19.639> can't<00:04:19.880> make<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.239> next<00:04:20.479> leap<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.349> think

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
just can't make that next leap I think

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.740 
just can't make that next leap I think
this<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.400> year<00:04:22.430> for<00:04:22.760> them<00:04:23.029> they<00:04:23.389> finish

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
this is the year for them they finish

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.400 
this is the year for them they finish
the<00:04:23.900> season

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
flying under the radar because look at

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.240 
flying under the radar because look at
the<00:04:29.150> Davidic<00:04:29.750> conference<00:04:30.230> there<00:04:30.440> in<00:04:30.590> its

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.960 
the circus that's going on to that team
and<00:04:47.420> then<00:04:47.930> you've<00:04:48.710> got<00:04:48.920> an<00:04:49.070> upstart<00:04:49.490> Indiana

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
and then you've got an upstart Indiana

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.580 
and then you've got an upstart Indiana
team<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:50.510> i<00:04:50.540> think<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.840> another<00:04:51.170> team<00:04:51.380> that's

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
team that i think is another team that's

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.160 
team that i think is another team that's
flying<00:04:51.800> under<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.130> radar<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:53.060> lower<00:04:53.570> down<00:04:53.720> is

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
flying under the radar and lower down is

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.890 
flying under the radar and lower down is
the<00:04:54.500> knicks<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.910> get<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.180> lot<00:04:56.390> of<00:04:56.420> ink<00:04:56.690> because

that<00:05:01.520> down<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.910> stretch<00:05:02.150> was<00:05:02.420> playing<00:05:02.690> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
that down the stretch was playing the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.690 
that down the stretch was playing the
best<00:05:02.990> ball<00:05:03.230> he's<00:05:03.470> ever<00:05:03.680> played<00:05:03.890> for<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.370> next

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
best ball he's ever played for the next

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.520 
best ball he's ever played for the next
you<00:05:05.090> know<00:05:05.120> he<00:05:05.330> was<00:05:05.450> putting<00:05:05.660> up<00:05:05.810> 40<00:05:06.230> a<00:05:06.260> game

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
you know he was putting up 40 a game

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.370 
you know he was putting up 40 a game
there<00:05:06.830> for<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.280> while<00:05:07.640> I<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.780> think<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.140> team

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
there for a while I just think this team

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.740 
there for a while I just think this team
is<00:05:09.530> underrated<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:11.090> this<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.480> going<00:05:11.690> to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
is underrated I think this is going to

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.290 
is underrated I think this is going to
go<00:05:11.930> seven<00:05:12.380> games<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.920> series<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.490> think<00:05:14.210> the

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
go seven games this series I think the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.600 
go seven games this series I think the
values<00:05:14.690> taken<00:05:14.840> Atlanta<00:05:15.440> decir<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.890> think<00:05:16.190> it

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
values taken Atlanta decir I think it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.150 
values taken Atlanta decir I think it
game<00:05:16.880> by<00:05:17.090> game<00:05:17.120> they'll<00:05:18.020> be<00:05:18.230> betting<00:05:18.620> value<00:05:19.040> in

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
game by game they'll be betting value in

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.980 
game by game they'll be betting value in
Atlanta<00:05:19.550> because<00:05:19.670> I<00:05:19.850> think<00:05:20.240> like<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.750> said<00:05:20.960> I

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
Atlanta because I think like I said I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.510 
Atlanta because I think like I said I
made<00:05:21.230> Boston<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.710> one-point<00:05:22.070> favorite<00:05:22.400> on<00:05:22.490> a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
made Boston a one-point favorite on a

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.400 
made Boston a one-point favorite on a
neutral<00:05:22.700> court<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.390> I<00:05:23.840> think<00:05:24.080> there'll<00:05:24.260> be<00:05:24.290> a

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
neutral court and I think there'll be a

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.900 
neutral court and I think there'll be a
lot<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.740> times<00:05:25.100> throughout<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.640> series

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
lot of times throughout the series

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.270 
lot of times throughout the series
they'll<00:05:26.480> be<00:05:26.510> valuing<00:05:27.230> bet<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.530> Atlanta<00:05:27.920> but<00:05:28.220> I

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
they'll be valuing bet in Atlanta but I

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.430 
they'll be valuing bet in Atlanta but I
think<00:05:28.550> when<00:05:28.670> it's<00:05:28.820> all<00:05:28.940> said<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.210> done<00:05:29.440> Boston

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
think when it's all said and done Boston

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.170 
think when it's all said and done Boston
will<00:05:30.560> come<00:05:30.740> out<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:31.340> know<00:05:31.370> with<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:31.790> win<00:05:31.970> I

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
will come out you know with the win I

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.000 
will come out you know with the win I
think<00:05:32.810> what<00:05:32.960> was<00:05:33.110> going<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.380> matter<00:05:33.560> most<00:05:33.830> in

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
think what was going to matter most in

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.830 
think what was going to matter most in
this<00:05:34.160> series<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.760> we're<00:05:35.300> going<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.450> find<00:05:35.660> out

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
this series is we're going to find out

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.690 
this series is we're going to find out
tonight<00:05:36.050> who<00:05:36.200> gets<00:05:36.590> home<00:05:36.770> court<00:05:37.160> because

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
tonight who gets home court because

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.610 
tonight who gets home court because
Boston's<00:05:38.270> done<00:05:38.540> all<00:05:38.690> their<00:05:38.840> damage<00:05:39.290> at<00:05:39.440> home

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
Boston's done all their damage at home

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.650 
Boston's done all their damage at home
they're<00:05:39.830> 23<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.490> nine<00:05:40.669> at<00:05:40.880> home<00:05:41.060> they<00:05:41.480> don't

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
they're 23 and nine at home they don't

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.270 
they're 23 and nine at home they don't
even<00:05:41.750> have<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.020> winning<00:05:42.290> record<00:05:42.560> on<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.070> road

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
even have a winning record on the road

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.640 
even have a winning record on the road
so<00:05:43.850> for<00:05:44.120> them<00:05:44.300> home<00:05:44.870> court<00:05:45.260> is<00:05:45.350> going<00:05:45.440> to<00:05:45.560> be

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
so for them home court is going to be

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.040 
so for them home court is going to be
extremely<00:05:45.860> important<00:05:46.760> in<00:05:46.850> this<00:05:47.000> series<00:05:47.360> so

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
extremely important in this series so

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.050 
extremely important in this series so
I'm<00:05:48.590> interested<00:05:49.040> to<00:05:49.070> see<00:05:49.160> what<00:05:49.460> happens<00:05:49.820> there

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
I'm interested to see what happens there

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.550 
I'm interested to see what happens there
but<00:05:50.270> again<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.540> think<00:05:50.690> they<00:05:51.140> will<00:05:51.410> be

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
but again I think they will be

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.370 
but again I think they will be
overvalued<00:05:51.860> on<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> game-by-game<00:05:52.790> basis<00:05:53.780> but

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
overvalued on a game-by-game basis but

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.990 
overvalued on a game-by-game basis but
I'm<00:05:54.530> not<00:05:54.710> willing<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.160> bet<00:05:55.370> Atlanta<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:55.970> win

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
I'm not willing to bet Atlanta to win

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.090 
I'm not willing to bet Atlanta to win
