00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.080 
just as you start to see bubbles kind of
forming<00:02:20.950> around<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.220> edge<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:21.970> you're

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
forming around the edge then you're

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.360 
forming around the edge then you're
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.239> turn<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> down<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.890> simmers

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
going to turn it down so it just simmers

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
going to turn it down so it just simmers
basically<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:25.209> want<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.480> boil<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.230> you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
basically don't want to boil it so you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.050 
basically don't want to boil it so you
just<00:02:26.410> want<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.620> simmer<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.070> for<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.340> few<00:02:27.700> minutes

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
just want to simmer it for a few minutes

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.550 
just want to simmer it for a few minutes
and<00:02:28.900> whilst<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.590> hitting<00:02:30.040> I've<00:02:30.970> got<00:02:31.560> five

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
and whilst that is hitting I've got five

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.130 
and whilst that is hitting I've got five
you<00:02:32.769> need<00:02:32.920> five<00:02:33.130> egg<00:02:33.550> yolks<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.900> yolks

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
you need five egg yolks just the yolks

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.180 
you need five egg yolks just the yolks
in<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.920> large<00:02:36.430> kind<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.030> heatproof<00:02:37.690> Bowl<00:02:38.190> right

in a large kind of heatproof Bowl right

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.960 
in a large kind of heatproof Bowl right
now<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.780> put<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.049> more<00:02:41.230> in

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
now it's going to put one more in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
going into the egg yolks now whilst the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.050 
going into the egg yolks now whilst the
milk<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.060> heating<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.820> whisk

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
milk is heating I'm just going to whisk

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.000 
milk is heating I'm just going to whisk
those<00:03:01.299> together

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.319 

people<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.069> want<00:03:10.219> to<00:03:10.250> beat<00:03:10.579> your<00:03:10.819> eggs<00:03:11.090> and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
sugar together basically until they come

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.209 
sugar together basically until they come
start<00:03:14.719> getting<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.049> bit<00:03:15.260> thicker<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.069> they're

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
start getting a bit thicker and they're

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.849 
start getting a bit thicker and they're
kind<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.579> bit<00:03:16.730> lighter<00:03:16.939> and<00:03:17.180> color<00:03:17.420> as<00:03:17.659> well

kind of a bit lighter and color as well

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.530 
kind of a bit lighter and color as well
so<00:03:18.859> give<00:03:19.099> them<00:03:19.189> a<00:03:19.310> really<00:03:19.730> good<00:03:19.939> way<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> their

so give them a really good way to their

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.199 
so give them a really good way to their
next<00:03:21.349> step<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.709> when<00:03:21.950> your<00:03:22.069> milk<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.579> ready

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
it's warmed you're going to pour it

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
it's warmed you're going to pour it
gently<00:03:25.900> into<00:03:26.900> your<00:03:26.930> egg<00:03:27.140> mixture<00:03:28.090> next<00:03:29.090> to

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
gently into your egg mixture next to

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.990 
gently into your egg mixture next to
warm<00:03:29.750> cream<00:03:30.079> into<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.439> egg<00:03:30.650> yolks<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.430> just

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
warm cream into the egg yolks and just

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.759 
warm cream into the egg yolks and just
keep<00:03:32.150> stirring<00:03:32.569> for<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.079> couple<00:03:33.379> of<00:03:33.439> minutes<00:03:33.709> so

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.360 

that

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.610 

what<00:06:43.970> you<00:06:44.060> gonna<00:06:44.150> do<00:06:44.389> is<00:06:44.690> basically<00:06:45.130> keep

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
what you gonna do is basically keep

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.990 
what you gonna do is basically keep
swimming<00:06:48.620> the<00:06:48.800> heat<00:06:49.010> around<00:06:49.220> on<00:06:49.639> top<00:06:49.790> of<00:06:49.910> it

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
swimming the heat around on top of it

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:03.939 
swimming the heat around on top of it
until<00:06:50.960> it<00:06:51.080> goes<00:06:51.229> brown

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.890 

so<00:07:04.949> after<00:07:05.130> you<00:07:05.400> blow<00:07:05.639> toward<00:07:06.000> it<00:07:06.270> you<00:07:06.600> want<00:07:06.780> to

leave it to cool for like a couple of
minutes<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.120> then<00:07:09.810> it'll<00:07:10.530> go<00:07:11.660> whoa<00:07:13.190> crunchy
