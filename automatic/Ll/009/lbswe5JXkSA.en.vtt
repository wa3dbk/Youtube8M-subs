tapped on that network name it should

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.290 
tapped on that network name it should
just<00:03:00.840> connect<00:03:01.290> automatically<00:03:02.060> mine<00:03:03.060> was

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
cache of that password so I had to

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.350 
cache of that password so I had to
re-enter<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.920> that's<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.730> once<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.150> get

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
re-enter it and that's it once you get

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.570 
re-enter it and that's it once you get
