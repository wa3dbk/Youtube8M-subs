your big shiny desktop PC so a couple

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.780 
your big shiny desktop PC so a couple
years<00:01:19.930> ago<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.350> came<00:01:20.740> around<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.250> crazy

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
years ago I came around to this crazy

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.360 
years ago I came around to this crazy
idea<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.320> think<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.650> web<00:01:23.920> thing<00:01:24.159> it's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
idea and I think this web thing it's

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.960 
idea and I think this web thing it's
probably<00:01:24.940> gonna<00:01:25.390> stick<00:01:25.810> around<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
probably gonna stick around and it

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.690 
probably gonna stick around and it
should<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.600> sounds<00:01:29.140> dumb<00:01:29.409> but<00:01:29.770> alot<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.370> mmos

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
should that sounds dumb but alot of mmos

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.180 
should that sounds dumb but alot of mmos
really<00:01:31.540> haven't<00:01:31.930> truly<00:01:32.170> embraced<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.950> yet

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
really haven't truly embraced that yet

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.910 
really haven't truly embraced that yet
and<00:01:33.510> we<00:01:34.510> are<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.200> be<00:01:35.320> one<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.680> first

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
ones to completely do it so a lot of

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.360 
ones to completely do it so a lot of

this<00:04:48.289> is<00:04:48.620> what<00:04:49.130> we<00:04:49.400> are<00:04:49.669> using<00:04:49.940> ourselves<00:04:50.660> for

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
this is what we are using ourselves for

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.520 
this is what we are using ourselves for
the<00:04:51.110> game

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
the game

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.170 
the game
it's<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.919> first-class<00:04:52.370> way<00:04:52.759> to<00:04:52.819> get

information out of the game and that

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.730 
information out of the game and that
means<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.599> can<00:04:56.810> build<00:04:57.050> just<00:04:57.590> about

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
means that you can build just about

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.159 
means that you can build just about
anything<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.580> know<00:04:58.669> do<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.060> want<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.660> display
