00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.240 
Airport the controller was suspended was
drug<00:01:57.060> tested<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:57.810> an<00:01:57.960> investigation

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.649 
but the outcome hasn't been made public
yet<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:02.430> when<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.640> talk<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.329> fatigue

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
yet and when you talk about the fatigue
issues<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.140> mean<00:02:04.460> we're<00:02:05.460> talking<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:05.759> people

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880

who are working night shifts right
that's<00:02:08.009> correct<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.580> more<00:02:09.239> than<00:02:09.420> that

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

that's been in place for decades is
normal<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.020> acceptable<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.190> is

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the same kinds of medical risk that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.090 
the same kinds of medical risk that
pilots<00:03:42.180> would<00:03:42.270> have<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:43.710> you<00:03:43.800> think<00:03:43.860> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
pilots would have and do you think that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.010 
pilots would have and do you think that
in<00:03:44.310> this<00:03:44.460> case<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.820> fact<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.660> Hank

in this case the fact that Hank

in this case the fact that Hank
Krakowski<00:03:46.710> has<00:03:46.980> resigned<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.450> enough<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
Krakowski has resigned is is enough and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.800 
Krakowski has resigned is is enough and
is<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.460> fair<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.090> he's<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.420> one<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.690> should

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
is it fair but he's the one that should

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.160 
is it fair but he's the one that should
go<00:03:51.960> it's<00:03:52.860> unclear<00:03:53.100> if<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.970> fair<00:03:54.210> because<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
go it's unclear if it's fair because the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.140 
go it's unclear if it's fair because the
details<00:03:55.590> behind<00:03:55.800> ye<00:03:56.250> resigned<00:03:56.760> haven't

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
details behind ye resigned haven't

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.480 
details behind ye resigned haven't
really<00:03:57.390> been<00:03:57.510> released<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:58.860> whether<00:03:59.220> or<00:03:59.370> not

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
really been released but whether or not

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.040 
really been released but whether or not
this<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.850> enough<00:04:00.150> certainly<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.690> isn't

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
this is enough certainly it isn't

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.710 
this is enough certainly it isn't
because<00:04:01.670> operational<00:04:02.670> issues<00:04:03.000> may<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.570> a
