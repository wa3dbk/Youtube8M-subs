 raffaella carrÃ  also wants an opinion from 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.470
 you look right noemi is controversial 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.079
 his presence in voice 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.020
 but if the people who are honest are 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:30.420

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.010

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.110
 cristina who for the first time in the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.480

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.900
 Sister Cristina I can only say one thing 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:07.650
 After this performance now that is 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:11.280
 true show biz is an inside joke plots 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.070
 internet to which then is the first time 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.380
 as you said it was the first time 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.450
 that we hear cristina singing in 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.130
 Italian and the feeling of people too 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.580
 at home as my parents have already mentioned 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.500
 Colleagues 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.690
 also this week we had to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.729
 having to do with the usual col 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.620
 usual group of haters that I am 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.900
 convinced that the liking of cristina 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.090
 depends exclusively on the dress but 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.830
 they are the same ones who think that to do 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.510
 rock need tight pants 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.669
 tight so tight that you should 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:44.490
 see where the notes come from understands 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:46.830
 so they are tight-minded 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.570
 here more than the pro did not give him the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.040
 litmus test gave him the proof of 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.590
 90 fear 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.900
 and then I more than 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.530
 I have to thank him here for giving us 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.530

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.490

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.819
