this<00:01:07.409> sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> stuff<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.810> see

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this sort of stuff from which is you see

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.609 
this sort of stuff from which is you see
how<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.610> are<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> Leafs<00:01:12.090> quite<00:01:12.689> wrong<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
how that are the Leafs quite wrong I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.910 
how that are the Leafs quite wrong I
know<00:01:13.799> they've<00:01:14.070> got<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> couple<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.700> erm<00:01:15.920> snails
