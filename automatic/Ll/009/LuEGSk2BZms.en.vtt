 4 wheels 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.559
 body and engine it would seem that else 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.540
 need a car enthusiast to be happy but 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.490
 closed garages there are always those to whom 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.710
 not enough standard 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.750
 car about mushroom standard cars it 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.820
 increase the rate of change of external 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 body type modifications of the chassis and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.720
 Salon how it looks and why you need it 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.760
 such time-consuming procedures to analyze 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.390
 on a specific example car da 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.790

 105 horsepower want to do something 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.019
 just taken is done by mistakes on 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.510
 sample mixing paint and putty here 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.400
 someone so begins all wheel replacements 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 larger disc diameter is selected and 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.690
 wide tires need this to improve 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.729
 handling characteristics for the same 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.619
 targets need to file springs 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.080
 suspension machine gets lower and 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:04.729
 holds the road so tight it is on my

 cooling backlight on the buffer and on the light 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.630
 due to alterations changing external 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.490
 dashboard and interior view 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.140
 sports seats are installed with 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.460
 improved ergonomics appears 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.770
 many additional sensors 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.549
 devices and switches for each of them 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.549
 its purpose 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.750
 speaking of external changes the body is not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.520
 with the exception of modification has undergone the hood 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.649
 additional holes are made in it 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.210
 to cool the motor on the cover 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.679
 trunk mounted spoiler for 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.600
 aerodynamic improvements 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.499
 go in and the front bumper is changed to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.499
 sports models 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.530
 important is the power 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.330
 sound design but still the most 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.370
 the main motor, he was also pumped 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.110
 powerful turbine boost speeds 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
 characteristics in the end we get 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 racing car able to even contend 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 with expensive supercars 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.829
 there is no limit to perfection 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.110
 limit and talent garage lovers
