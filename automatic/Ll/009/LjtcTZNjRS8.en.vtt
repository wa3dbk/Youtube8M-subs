00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
in little this is I guess easy but for

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.490 
in little this is I guess easy but for
the<00:00:29.519> gamers<00:00:30.060> who<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.630> found<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:31.080> about<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the gamers who just found out about it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.459 
the gamers who just found out about it
it's<00:00:32.309> pretty<00:00:32.820> hard<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.360> first<00:00:33.540> time<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.809> did<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's pretty hard the first time I did it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's pretty hard the first time I did it
it<00:00:34.620> took<00:00:34.829> me<00:00:35.250> 20<00:00:35.700> minutes<00:00:36.380> and<00:00:37.380> then<00:00:37.680> second

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
it took me 20 minutes and then second

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670 
it took me 20 minutes and then second
time<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.579> took<00:00:39.120> 10<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> other<00:00:40.290> time

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
time I took 10 and then the other time

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.510 
time I took 10 and then the other time
it<00:00:40.950> took<00:00:41.070> five<00:00:41.340> no<00:00:41.760> time<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.800> wonder

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it took five no time to do so I wonder

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
it took five no time to do so I wonder
what<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:47.219> just

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.560 

hey<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:04.560> might<00:02:04.800> not<00:02:04.980> work<00:02:05.040> but

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570
