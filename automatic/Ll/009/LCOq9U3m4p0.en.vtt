00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.270
 next day I have to make 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.270
 filled my plans I go on the huts 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 I take breaks bricks and I 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.670
 fill the boli casinos so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 as you can see I fill 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.360
 everything but that man no brick breakers 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 here 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.350
 sorry the quality is not very good 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.950
 so once I recalled everything but 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.570
 breakout hut the g50 7290 this 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.240
 elixir 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 so what am I going to do now 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.950
 I'm going to go to bed 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 so I'm going to leave clash of clan 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.260
 the man the next day the drama tomorrow 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.260
 morning I post that clan heat 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:14.160
 here I go back the heater clan the game 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:19.140
 revive let's imagine I would have 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.680
 attacked that night like that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.450
 spent so tonight the level 48 guy 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.360
 took only 12 1875 elixir we do not see 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.980
 very well so he took me two 1875 and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.350
 to write it says 7800 will you 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.480
 gold so not me he taught me not 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.400
 great thing so I go back to my 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.400
 hut the next morning and I resell 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.270
 is only a trick so I do not know if 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.930
 you can see it on the video but he 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.520
 there is a little less next to the frame so 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.640
 I vote some broken mega bricks 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.640
 man 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.340
 here 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.209
 I can not find that one 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.060
 so here I removed the whole box 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.440
 rugby my cabin and I end up with 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.420
 of the 197 1297 and the shots that the player 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.409
 that he attacked me and could not take 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.879
 since he was safe in the 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.170
 huts breaking up 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.440
 brick in his cabin before going to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.110
 sleep 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.470
 it's 2004 2000 and luc cyr at each box 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.049
 gross 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.660
 there I can put 40 so I can 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:08.579
 put 80 miles and write it aside 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:11.019
 like will not take what makes that 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:18.579
 I had and I managed to put 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:22.919
 the elixir in safety so here is already a 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.919
 technique that I wanted to explain to you 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.389
 it was sure bankai thing thing
