hey Clint Smith here from leat MTS calm
I've<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> question<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> QA<00:00:05.930> about<00:00:07.400> how

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I've got a question on the QA about how

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.970 
I've got a question on the QA about how
to<00:00:08.460> wear<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> belt<00:00:08.940> effectively<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.650> think

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
to wear a belt effectively and I think

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
to wear a belt effectively and I think
that's<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.370> good<00:00:12.030> topic<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> cover<00:00:12.719> may<00:00:13.380> seem

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
that's a good topic to cover may seem

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.070 
that's a good topic to cover may seem
simple<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.130> first<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.900> it's<00:00:15.900> definitely

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
simple at first but it's definitely

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.269 
simple at first but it's definitely
worth<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.650> over<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.789> first<00:00:18.150> thing<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:19.279> what

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
worth going over so first thing is what

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.960 
worth going over so first thing is what
type<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> belt<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:21.029> wear<00:00:22.789> specifically<00:00:23.789> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
type of belt to wear specifically I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.259

you know their own applications like you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.980 
you know their own applications like you
know<00:01:16.710> maybe<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.040> you're<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.869> know

training at a health club and just want
a<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> support<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.530> main

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a little bit of support but if your main

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.520 
a little bit of support but if your main
goal<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> lift<00:01:23.490> heavy<00:01:23.729> weight<00:01:24.000> than<00:01:24.570> 13

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
goal is to lift heavy weight than 13

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
goal is to lift heavy weight than 13
millimeters<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.430> four<00:01:26.670> inches<00:01:26.790> wide

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
millimeters like four inches wide

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.580 
millimeters like four inches wide
now<00:01:28.369> next<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.420> place<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
now next thing is where to place the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.030 
now next thing is where to place the
belt<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> shore<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.530> don't<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.890> too

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
belt on a shore so you don't want it too

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
belt on a shore so you don't want it too
low<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> too<00:01:36.659> low<00:01:36.869> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
low because if you get it too low then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
low because if you get it too low then
it's<00:01:37.680> definitely<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> bind<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.700> hips

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it's definitely going to bind your hips

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's definitely going to bind your hips
up<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> dig<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.170> hips<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
up it's going to dig into your hips and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
up it's going to dig into your hips and
that's<00:01:41.130> gonna<00:01:41.369> prevent<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.240> executing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that's gonna prevent you from executing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.819 
that's gonna prevent you from executing
the<00:01:43.049> lift<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.490> wear<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> too<00:01:44.850> high<00:01:45.119> then

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
the lift and you wear it too high then

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.539 
the lift and you wear it too high then
it's<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
it's not really going to be that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's not really going to be that
effective<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:48.360> stabilizing<00:01:48.689> your<00:01:49.380> trunk<00:01:50.270> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
effective at stabilizing your trunk so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.039 
effective at stabilizing your trunk so
the<00:01:51.869> best<00:01:52.110> place<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:54.240> as

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the best place for you where it is is as

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.660 
the best place for you where it is is as
low<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.560> possible<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.799> digging

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
low as possible so that it's not digging

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.389 
low as possible so that it's not digging
into<00:01:59.790> your<00:01:59.939> hips<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.829> long<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> can

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
into your hips so it as long as you can

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.980 
into your hips so it as long as you can
while<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.939> still<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.329> digging<00:02:03.719> into<00:02:03.840> your

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
while it's still not digging into your

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.649 
while it's still not digging into your
hips

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
hips

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.560 
hips
the<00:02:04.869> bottom<00:02:05.200> two<00:02:05.290> lifts<00:02:06.299> that's<00:02:07.299> going<00:02:07.509> to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
the bottom two lifts that's going to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.919 
the bottom two lifts that's going to
vary<00:02:07.750> from<00:02:08.080> lift<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.860> lift<00:02:09.039> for<00:02:10.030> example<00:02:10.479> a

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
vary from lift the lift for example a

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.050 
vary from lift the lift for example a
conventional<00:02:11.920> deadlift<00:02:12.310> where<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.880> have<00:02:13.030> a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
conventional deadlift where you have a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.660 
conventional deadlift where you have a
narrower<00:02:13.390> stance<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.640> to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
narrower stance and you really have to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.600 
narrower stance and you really have to
bend<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.180> lot<00:02:16.360> more<00:02:16.630> at<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.930> waist<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.980> you're

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
bend a lot more at the waist then you're

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.800 
bend a lot more at the waist then you're
going<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.760> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.000> wear<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.300> belt<00:02:19.480> higher

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
going to want to wear the belt higher

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.530 
going to want to wear the belt higher
then<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.500> would<00:02:20.709> say<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:21.970> are<00:02:22.060> doing<00:02:22.269> a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
then you would say if you are doing a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.729 
then you would say if you are doing a
wide<00:02:22.810> stance

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
wide stance

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.850 
wide stance
sumo<00:02:24.580> type<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.540> deadlift<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.620> torso

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
sumo type of deadlift because your torso

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.190 
sumo type of deadlift because your torso
is<00:02:27.250> much<00:02:27.459> higher<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.170> can

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
is much higher and you can and you can

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.420 
is much higher and you can and you can
effectively<00:02:29.860> use<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.670> lower<00:02:31.060> belt<00:02:31.330> position<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
effectively use a lower belt position so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030 
effectively use a lower belt position so
you<00:02:34.390> figure<00:02:35.110> out<00:02:35.170> where<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.470> where<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.860> need

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
you figure out where you where you need

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.410 
you figure out where you where you need
to<00:02:36.069> place<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:36.940> not<00:02:37.030> digging<00:02:37.330> in

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
to place it so that it's not digging in

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870 
to place it so that it's not digging in
your<00:02:37.540> hips<00:02:37.720> too<00:02:37.900> bad<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.380> then<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.640> next

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
your hips too bad and then the next

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.420 
your hips too bad and then the next
thing<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:41.110> want<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.349> have<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> downward

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
thing is you want to have a downward

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.240 
thing is you want to have a downward
angle<00:02:42.970> slight<00:02:43.480> downward<00:02:43.810> tilt<00:02:44.349> with<00:02:45.099> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
angle slight downward tilt with the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.030 
angle slight downward tilt with the
orientation<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.090> belt<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.709> reason

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
orientation of the belt and the reason

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.000 
orientation of the belt and the reason
this<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:48.640> because<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:50.380> want<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.739> be<00:02:50.890> able

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
this is is because you want to be able

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.640 
this is is because you want to be able
to<00:02:51.540> push<00:02:52.540> your<00:02:52.750> abdomen<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
to push your abdomen down and out and it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.460 
to push your abdomen down and out and it
kind<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:56.920> locks<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.549> belt<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.599> your<00:02:59.200> waist

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
kind of locks the belt in to your waist

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
kind of locks the belt in to your waist
and<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.829> top<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.190> your<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.959> really

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
and the top of your is and that's really

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.930 
and the top of your is and that's really
and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.799> gives<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.190> trunk<00:03:03.579> in<00:03:03.790> your

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
and then that gives your trunk in your

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.819 
and then that gives your trunk in your
stomach<00:03:04.750> muscles<00:03:04.930> something<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.560> push

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
stomach muscles something to push

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.620 
stomach muscles something to push
against<00:03:06.220> which<00:03:06.489> really<00:03:06.849> stabilizes<00:03:07.540> your

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
against which really stabilizes your

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.150 
against which really stabilizes your
lower<00:03:07.840> back<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.470> your<00:03:09.400> front<00:03:09.609> torso<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:11.160> when

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
lower back and your front torso so when

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.520 
lower back and your front torso so when
you<00:03:12.250> put<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.549> on<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:13.480> get<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.660> nice<00:03:13.900> tight<00:03:14.170> fit

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
you put it on you get a nice tight fit

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.099 
you put it on you get a nice tight fit
don't<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.880> think<00:03:16.030> about<00:03:16.150> contracting<00:03:16.989> your

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
don't just think about contracting your

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.960 
don't just think about contracting your
abs<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:17.799> about<00:03:17.980> pushing<00:03:18.400> them<00:03:18.489> out<00:03:18.640> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
abs think about pushing them out and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970 
abs think about pushing them out and
down<00:03:19.180> almost<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.590> that's<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.859> will

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
down almost like so that's that will

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.400 
down almost like so that's that will
really<00:03:24.190> make<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.519> feel<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:25.060> lot<00:03:25.450> sturdier<00:03:25.780> with

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
really make you feel a lot sturdier with

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.759 
really make you feel a lot sturdier with
the<00:03:26.530> weight<00:03:26.709> if<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.459> do<00:03:27.639> that<00:03:27.819> simple<00:03:28.769> simple

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
the weight if you do that simple simple

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.800 
the weight if you do that simple simple
tip<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.670> other<00:03:30.700> thing<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.269> how<00:03:31.420> tight<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
tip the other thing is how tight to

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.140 
tip the other thing is how tight to
where<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.079> bill<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.639> you<00:03:33.700> need<00:03:34.090> to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
where the bill you know you need to

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.120 
where the bill you know you need to
figure<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.690> out<00:03:34.750> for<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.950> need<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
figure that out for you and you need to

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.530 
figure that out for you and you need to
figure<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.519> out<00:03:36.609> based<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:37.180> what<00:03:37.359> you're<00:03:37.510> doing

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
figure it out based on what you're doing

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.000 
figure it out based on what you're doing
again<00:03:38.049> I'll<00:03:38.170> use<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.500> example<00:03:38.920> of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
again I'll use the example of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.009 
again I'll use the example of
conventional<00:03:39.670> versus<00:03:40.120> sumo<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
conventional versus sumo for the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.110 
conventional versus sumo for the
deadlift<00:03:41.549> conventionally<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.639> might<00:03:42.819> not<00:03:43.000> be

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
deadlift conventionally you might not be

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.840 
deadlift conventionally you might not be
able<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.299> wear<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.600> as<00:03:43.840> tight<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.549> and

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
able to wear it as tight and be and and

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.940 
able to wear it as tight and be and and
use<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.540> know<00:03:46.660> be<00:03:47.079> able<00:03:47.139> to<00:03:47.260> do<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> lift<00:03:47.739> well

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
use you know be able to do the lift well

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.220 
use you know be able to do the lift well
then<00:03:48.609> if<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.090> were<00:03:49.180> doing<00:03:49.389> sumo<00:03:49.810> because<00:03:50.139> of

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
then if you were doing sumo because of

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.509 
then if you were doing sumo because of
the<00:03:50.290> fact<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.769> bend<00:03:50.980> over<00:03:51.100> more<00:03:51.340> at<00:03:51.459> the

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
lever belt is it takes a longer time to

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.790 
lever belt is it takes a longer time to
adjust<00:05:50.890> cuz<00:05:51.100> you<00:05:51.190> get<00:05:51.340> on<00:05:51.520> unscrew<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:53.260> you

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
and that's definitely makes this easier
