00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 I lead everyone back to developing with my own 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.160
 channel and today I want to tell you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.190
 the set that came down the site 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.700
 aliexpress is the first Chinese set 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.330
 which i ordered i wanted 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.529
 try to raise on the canvas already with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.960
 printed pattern and 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 I came here like this 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 such a nuance when I buy a picture 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.590
 cross or even sew 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 I look here to crush this work 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 but this option on the site was 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.129
 This picture is presented which 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.230
 now you see before you and therefore 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 for me this is such a little gamble 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.590
 that it will turn out the size of the picture is not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 small for one groan account he will 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.689
 110 to 50 55 centimeters that 's what 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.350
 indicated here is the size apparently the most 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.350
 fabrics and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.310
 this is my book such a scheme 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 presented in the form of a book here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.170
 here is the layout on 20 pages 44 colors 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 strings 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.579
 Of course, kees x out and size 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.799
 crosses 480 by 240 crosses 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:43.170
 schemes, in principle , convenient to use 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 because that's who did not despite the fact 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.750
 that the offset of them is the same 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.270
 approximate colors which at 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 artificial light can be 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.770
 indistinguishable here such a scheme in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.770
 Basically it is possible to understand so that it will be a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:05.360
 gazebo so here it is these words 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.759
 here is this house 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.759
 at the car 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.420
 But this type of so looks paintings in 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.580
 but it is immediately apparent that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.000
 photoshop for the edge I think so 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.720
 scheme 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.470
 here are the strings laid out on the bed 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.209
 and because the picture is really big I 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.810
 I hope the colors are less visible what 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.010
 because I shot a little video but not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.010
 It turned out again in the evening I shoot at 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.250
 artificial more often and here are strings but this 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.020
 not yet everything is such a bunch of heaps and not 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.260
 so extra is a huge womb 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:20.420
 Here, rub 2 meters 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:31.100
 16 of these blacks are generally 40 each. 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:37.010
 meters of course the picture is so 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:46.120
 giant cheers so how would I show well 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:51.680
 so here you must see such a picture 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.530
 I thought that I would order it to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.459
 embroider 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.860
 when I am waiting for his daughter to lessons but to drag 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.920
 so big 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 such a large carpet as it called 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:12.560
 I think it will be uncomfortable here 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.020
 all is well printed but the only thing 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.450
 that there are some colors for example here 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.230
 these are blue 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:25.310
 turquoise colors 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:27.350
 which is possible when so here still when 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.750
 artificial light can be confused 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:35.540
 so you can look at the scheme as well 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.990
 in the kit there were two needles one of 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.990
 which 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.050
 Well, of course in general, one of them 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.250
 defective but the needles are very similar to 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.540
 pony needle 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.960
 4 account and as I also seller 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.960
 put down 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.920
 such a present 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.580
 needle threader and something 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.580
 needles 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:15.110
 The seller is a good good apparently 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.030
 famous because you are but very 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.140
 popular don't know don't remember how much u 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.300
 he is there a diamond kafka ron well good 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.680
 good seller almost immediately 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.990
 immediately the next day sent me 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:34.330
 order but plus reorder went on very long 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:37.760
 over 40 days 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.340
 such a purchase with aliexpress there by the way 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.340
 Yes, when I ordered her this picture 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.650
 it cost 1700 rubles without a discount 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.460
 before the dollar went up thousands 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.040
 seven hundred three Russian rubles at a discount 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.300
 she became 700 rubles so do not take her 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.470
 it would be a sin so we will 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:12.620
 try see what out of this 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:16.690
 get all thanks for your attention 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.690
 good luck to you and bye
