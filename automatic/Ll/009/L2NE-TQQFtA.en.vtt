00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.139
 We have been almost 10 days of snow 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.469
 there was 4 meters of new snow just that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.419
 day it happened that the sun came out 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 the night before they had dropped about 30 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.400
 centimeters of new and good snow 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.920
 we knew that risk we tried 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 minimize it by looking for the three 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.869
 sectors that we had planned we looked for 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 the least risk less pending than 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.320
 We believed that I would have only what I did not 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.660
 we expected it is what would happen 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.540
 I made four or five turns and there were already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 this that starts to open everything every 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.409
 Once I was bigger I went and tried 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 take back to try the 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.140
 overtake above but not impossible 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.540
 the whole mountain is falling and already 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 there came a moment that there was a click of 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.189
 two or three meters then that's it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 when all the avalanche from behind me 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:01.859
 he caught and started to roll 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 to them when I realized that already 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.150
 I was stuck that I was inside a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.549
 avalanche then the truth that I was 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.310
 everything all at all times was conscious 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.380
 of what he was doing and the first thought 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.500
 that was is to pull this from the airbag and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.159
 nothing, I put myself in a position like that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.130
 shrunken 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.140
 trying to avoid punches that is 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.170
 impossible because you do not even know where you are 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.899
 or if you're face up on your stomach if 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.569
 how much time do you have left to stop just 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.390
 you have to pray and wait for it not to happen 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.609
 nothing can be happy was I 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 I was buried until then 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.240
 I remember that I made myself a little space 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.789
 well with your hands and you can take the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.000
 hands and I told them that everything was all 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.689
 more or less ok I lost the skis I lost 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.250
 the glasses I lost the clubs and good the most 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.110
 important that I did not lose my life 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.709
 final is what counts the materials 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.969
 final is the least thanks to the 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.939
 backpack bs 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.039
 I can be here today telling everyone 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.390
 and the truth no longer just because it kept me 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.519
 to the surface of this but that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.519
 it also saved me from multiple injuries
