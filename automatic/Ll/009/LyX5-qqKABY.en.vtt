00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 where girls and I hope you go 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 well 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 I find you today for a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 new series of videos so I know 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 you're going to say oh there there with the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 New Year highlights its full of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 new series yes but good here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.560
 I hope it will interest you then 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.240
 actually like you've been pretty 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 many each time when I 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.289
 was making a video to ask me what 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 lipstick or I was enjoying little and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
 everything I actually thought about doing any 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 a series of videos to introduce you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.879
 nor lipstick when I have it when 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 not bad I thought I was going 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.350
 not to show them all in one video 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.620
 because a three-hour video does not 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.480
 is useless so I decided to do 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 small groups of five to seven reds 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.230
 sometimes a little bit more with death 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.289
 watch on the hand red photos 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.010
 lipstick worn so that will have some 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.359
 lipsticks between nimes and flashy 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.129
 from women's collections to collections 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.869
 a series with me lipstick at the bottom 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.260
 is it being said red stream 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.640
 brunettes to things like that and everything 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.130
 what I call my nude lipstick 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.049
 the company nude lipstick this does not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 are not sheep, they are roses 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 pink lipsticks let it be 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.590
 round schools that's that kind of color 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.070
 where I associate with gloss or more 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.790
 or less so here is today 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.460
 will start with them five sets I know 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.409
 not flashy lipstick 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.790
 so I'm starting right now I'm going 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.119
 start with the one I wear in this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.490
 moment it's the red chic a fruit football 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 ponchos and it seems to me in fact that he 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 have gemini molines so he gets 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.110
 present like that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.970
 it's really moisturizing I mean 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 in the hands and does not dry out the student does not 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.690
 not necessarily feel the need to 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.220
 put up over which I you 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.220
 do a little boy be shocked like that 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:18.890
 and of course the photo is then there 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.910
 is a lipstick that is chic 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.720
 inique called pic berry so he 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.800
 is like this here it's all 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.470
 give as we also say very 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.750
 moisturizer that does not dry lips 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.750
 and I think he's cute 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.110
 of course all the lipsticks 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.840
 that I present you are red 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.540
 lipstick that you can wear with 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 gloss and gentlemen you do what 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.630
 you want I mean you change the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.100
 rendered you can of course put some 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.390
 ice cubes of the counselor or more clear 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 depending on the rendering you want 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.780
 then there is the rugby diam's 104 of 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.280
 at gemey maybelline 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.280
 he's like that 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.800
 and he too is still pretty 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:21.680
 moisturizing but it has more an infinity 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:26.200
 glossy here it is - it's no longer 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.200
 glossy that must Canadian 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.780
 here is the 82.10 euros in a rose 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.340
 enough not been let's say I have not so 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.870
 you will see but in fact he has 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.870
 multiple multicolored sequins 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.340
 then I have lipstick 37 red 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.640
 pure yves saint laurent who an orange 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.370
 and others like that needles like 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:09.510
 that but also the sooner it rained 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.420
 will be glo if the wreckage morning and we will 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.660
 to say that he is between matt and he will miss 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.410
 here he was finally able to go in all 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:28.440
 case on the lips 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:30.300
 it's more satigny we'll say next 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.870
 there is the lipstick gloss win 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.830
 10 009 of the mark jordan so I 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.600
 not going to die it's called burgundy 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.940
 because in general the colors that 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 are associated with that name there are more 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.860
 dark but here it's more its pink I 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.100
 find very pretty bitter pink 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.770
 if he has not associated himself 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.430
 atmosphere really so this is this 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.430
 color if 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:06.590
 and he too likes to say that he is between 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.100
 matt and between matt and they have to 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.950
 expect 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.870
 he's in between we're going to say he 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:20.930
 do not dry out the books we are waiting 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:26.330
 more to finish there is the lipstick 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:30.940
 14 so too bad word or the what name 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:34.640
 oman cadou post of the mark bel 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.950
 so it's a bit of an orange brown and I 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.450
 find it very pretty 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.640
 good personally I will not wear 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.260
 alone I would put a gloss by 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.970
 on it I'm not what color but 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.780
 think it's a very pretty color 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.780
 the swatch 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.670
 so here I hope you liked 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.220
 this little presentation of this red 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.870
 I hope it can help you 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.980
 in your lipstick research 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.830
 Also you are looking for reds to 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.630
 lips to the mayor in that color there and 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.800
 so I think the next video I 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.630
 you will present these are the red ones to 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.010
 dark lips and then then I 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:21.130
 will continue on the lipsticks 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:21.550
 flashy and then the nude rose if you can 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.100
 say 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.560
 and so here it is I hope that any 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.720
 this small series of videos will please you 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.890
 and I make you big kisses and I 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.910
 tell you next time in another 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.910
 video lease 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.780
 that was waiting for us
