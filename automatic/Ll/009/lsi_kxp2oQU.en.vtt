00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.270
 well we are here today on the day of 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.850
 kings let's see what they have brought us 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.039
 here the kings a couple of points so that 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.379
 the wise men would have to have more 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.299
 magicians and less kings but good we are going to 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.799
 see the wise men pass and let's see 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.540
 what puzzle they have brought us do not have to 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 see anything this with rubik's cube but 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.539
 we are going to see them 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220
 They are from the Wizard's Houdini Collection 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 this is why there had to be more magicians 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.270
 that kings and well they are the puzzles 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.840
 that comes in these boxes we buy 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.379
 in a big establishment over here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.570
 this cost 795 and this cost 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.230
 the kings cost how much is not what 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059
 I keep proposing 14 or something like that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.880
 so then let's see these puzzles 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.370
 I have here with chin chon 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.260
 say hi here are you going to solve the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.700
 because they are very simple then we go 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.840
 to open the box is to see what is 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.790
 about 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.910
 let's see what we do here the box 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.770
 the cardboard pretty good then we go 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.900
 to see how it falls apart and let's see what 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.300
 such the first impressions good 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.680
 we have some box and this what there is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.870
 that making peace with the box is a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 little curious normal and current and there 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.860
 that trying to open it there is no type 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 of instruction says it's on the web 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 how this is done but good we 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.830
 you are going to try to open come when it has 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.330
 cost open it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 come on let's do a test you look at it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.690
 on the one hand and what is there to be 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 do to open it push and in a 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.479
 site and it opens does not have any damn 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.100
 mystery this is a little trivial but 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.410
 Well, what do you think about losing here? 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 your money does not have the two magnets here 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.850
 have there are two others then after 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 here 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 has here a mechanism are sunk 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.250
 it's all here I thought it 's could 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.310
 be like a Chinese box and then it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.330
 open here and it has already opened 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.020
 a little shit 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.230
 that you take and put a gift and such 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.610

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.330
 to see how you do it every time you did 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.280

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 you have had water and truth is coming 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.760
 with two keys in principle I told them 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.560

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.880

 the law is speaking I the first thing 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.260
 I did was looking at the keys that were 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 same 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.659

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.060
 with the key it sticks it has a mechanism 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.040
 internal 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.090
 what it does is block this topic 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040
 a lot of people are going around with the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.520
 key that does nothing and then this 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.920
