00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.859
 otherwise it was great year for me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.329
 because I arrived here on March 26 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.179
 and my son was born on March 29 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.550
 we are going to move with my pregnant wife 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.710
 it was something 2011 thanks to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.839
 facilities here my son you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.129
 add after and my license in 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:43.260
 taking public romania at the beginning 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.550
 when we have nothing we start a little like 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.550
 his horse flesh 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.500
 and then that's it and then it's not 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:03.640
 too badly spent from the beginning so after 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 you see you're working 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.220
 correctly they come back to see 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.399
 today on this site there are 17 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.240
 euros what does he do to the 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:19.689
 pavement fluctuation the foals of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.530
 I like that the foals I need 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.909
 believe it's jean pierre who is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.299
 wood that had said the best 6 follow 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.530
 pea and here it is I think he 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.270
 always first reason jean pierre 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.270
 dumont so looking for him 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.320
 in the morning 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.299
 work to warm up or who too much 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 suddenly hit the water like that 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.000
 now galloping and at this time 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.259
 there at the warming she was pulling a little 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.939
 at first I'm worried I say what is it 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.520
 is happening it's done wrong everything 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.990
 and then I said good she was a little 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.000
 nervous and everything is laid back in 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.220
 the same time that I was thinking and I 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 I'll let her do it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.140
 too soon like that to mach 1 after their 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.940
 tombs drouot all alone for lame 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.310
 nothing good work nicely to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.590
 see and then does his job door if 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 we're going back to the job of three 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.220
 days after the same thing so we go 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.750
 let it go I 'm going to the course that the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.150
 next shot she makes her run and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.319
 takes a place as often and then 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.829
 it's gone like that so foiled 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.030
 blofeld and joel do not apologize 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.230
 I noticed that in general when 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.459
 he does that it's a good sign that she 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.660
 is in his head is that he is 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.709
 flexible so let her do 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.379
 she is capable of 500 meters 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.170
 like that but if when we get to the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.359
 keep 2 100 200 300 meters the ss is 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.639
 really a nice tip of speed 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.100
 but it's really a judgment he 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.569
 have to run hidden and if to go out the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.160
 as late as possible 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.260
 and there actually when she at 200-300 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.260
 meters she goes fast 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.120
 from marcel world to shot any time 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.780
 regularly for not like crazy but 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.070
 it is a mare that must be left 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.120
 recover between races anyway at 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.040
 fifteen days three weeks because 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.480
 that she is better so we will re insisted 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.490
 we will resort next shot that you 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.750
 to have class if they win at next 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.330
 blow if we manage to make a hold up 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.740
 after their arrival fake his little 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.770
 tricky thing she knew by 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.770
 heart these three intervals like that 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.750
 that's it's not wrong job 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.170
 naughty it's a job to let her 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.629
 in his farm or even three weeks 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.810
 place no nonsense hours between 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.150
 two races it's intervals but this 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.099
 that because I attach the important 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.650
 it's as much of a recuperation between 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.780
 intervals actually the intensity of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.500
 interval is a thing to work in 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.640
 30 years 40 or more if you want and after if 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 you work more or less hard it's 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.209
 the recovery time haunts the intervals 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.680
 there in this case it was long 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.680
 recovery time so in fact it's not a 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.049
 very very hard job who flew over 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.579
 imposing master hard we shorten 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.889
 temples recovery by train 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.769
 interval and there we always hold a 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.769
 little in the hard 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.410
 lucien kouna as gentleman the goff and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.300
 brands sellers as I had had 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.500
 six there I said I'll go 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.100
 buy what so I did buy at 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.030
 my father-in-law and to my wife's pen 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.380
 where the story is beautiful is that 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.260
 it's their first racehorse and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.870
 that he won hamas is so great 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.910
 history is also the good times of 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.040
 our job I remind you that day 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.750
 so there was my father who is not 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.060
 Someone of very demonstrative that samir 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.010
 is there the wife of uncle sam who she 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.270
 howled the day the horse passes the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.919
 yet at heart she was in the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.840
 stands from the top of the stands I 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.160
 wait for the duo the writings and the jump 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.810
 run to jump in the arms 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.810
 that's great compared to his thirst or 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.250
 who run he is put to run every 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.080
 fifteen days is good so there is a 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.060
 climb climb that falls to fifteen 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.990
 days we will put their head under 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.520
 water it is well built koussa good we're going 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.940
 unshod not watched the feet 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.280
 kick after I love this racetrack 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.669
 for me it's the same, so we're not going 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.120
 to do I play it is like if of France 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.380
 of rugby go to the stadium of france for 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.090
 to get it smoothly what internal it 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.539
 must be given to the maximum so if I 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.740
 go to vincennes it's paper I 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:57.289
 think of having a chance to take to 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:59.180
 sleeves and I was rugby player 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.729
 since very small had to start 11 years 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.690
 I played 25 years when I stopped when 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.720
 I started my business because 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.830
 I did not risk hurting myself 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.630
 so I was a player coach and 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.979
 I also had a colleague who trained 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.639
 the screen and who were poor two 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.710
 scores in more and so who us her and 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.070
 him the physical preparation program 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.820
 and / or so I learned a lot of things 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.260
 all that to cook the work in 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.470
 intervals and all that we love you or 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.830
 heard a frame that player and I 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.229
 taken from the principles of that things 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.300
 to take a blurred image for the 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.650
 established fitness trainer 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.510
 different programs within a single 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.160
 team he can establish programs 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.219
 different according to the players according to their 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.740
 own abilities already and then after we 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.860
 tried to combine 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.780
 the mind for it to be always 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.009
 volunteer at work all that so we 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.620
 try to do those things there too on 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.680
 the horses I'm also trying to find 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.789
 in in my horses in values 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.810
 that I loved in the teeth the 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:09.069
 rugby players ie the envi 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.039
 give the maximum capable of a lot 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:13.930
 to work 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.350
 here and want to give everything they 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.660
 have 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.480
 it's worth me, we can dream all 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.800
 days a little late have to be careful 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.880
 to be carried away by the wings 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.130
 that's me I'm working I do not know what 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:33.770
 that I do I chose I chose everything 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:34.790
 forgot to play make his profession a 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.970
 luck in europe 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.110
 the junkie are 25 years old for work 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.250
 they still do not know what he wants 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.430
 do it I can not find their 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.080
 bench who are so his mother all their lives 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.440
 what am I going to do less a 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.970
 month 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.030
 twelve years old I knew what I wanted 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.030
 to make reports I saved time 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:58.090
 now you have to work and for 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.090
 resist the pressure 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.770
 only who puts pressure on this bank and 

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.770
 he is scary of me
