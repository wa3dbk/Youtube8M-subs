00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
complicated of the steps then we finally

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
complicated of the steps then we finally
just<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.890> installing<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> condor<00:00:38.850> software

this down make sure because every time

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.690 
this down make sure because every time
condor<00:05:16.210> starts<00:05:16.840> you'll<00:05:17.080> have<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.710> enter<00:05:18.520> this

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
condor starts you'll have to enter this

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.060

as the root password for the mysql

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.150 
as the root password for the mysql
server<00:05:21.660> so<00:05:22.660> again<00:05:22.900> we<00:05:23.050> recommend<00:05:23.530> not<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.770> have

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
server so again we recommend not to have

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.020 
server so again we recommend not to have
any<00:05:24.540> password<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.680> then<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.130> have<00:05:27.370> the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
any password and so then you have the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.510 
any password and so then you have the
modified<00:05:28.570> security<00:05:29.139> settings<00:05:29.530> unchecked<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
modified security settings unchecked and

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.420 
modified security settings unchecked and
then<00:05:31.030> just<00:05:31.300> click<00:05:31.540> Next<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.800> again<00:05:33.070> it's<00:05:33.250> your

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
then just click Next so again it's your

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.330 
then just click Next so again it's your
personal<00:05:34.300> preference<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:36.010> then<00:05:36.160> finally

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
personal preference and then finally

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.100 
personal preference and then finally
step<00:05:36.790> 35<00:05:37.750> is<00:05:37.930> just<00:05:38.080> click<00:05:38.380> execute<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:40.110> what

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
step 35 is just click execute and what

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.200 
step 35 is just click execute and what
that<00:05:41.290> will<00:05:41.440> do<00:05:41.650> that<00:05:41.680> will<00:05:42.070> execute<00:05:42.669> all<00:05:43.030> these
