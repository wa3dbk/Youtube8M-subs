00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
well welcome to this my lot of IT video

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.910 
well welcome to this my lot of IT video
one<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.870> these<00:00:04.020> wonderful<00:00:04.440> things<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.740> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
one of these wonderful things about the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.550 
one of these wonderful things about the
USB<00:00:05.100> ports<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.640> you<00:00:05.759> can<00:00:05.910> actually<00:00:06.029> plug

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
USB ports is you can actually plug

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.450 
USB ports is you can actually plug
surface<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.710> other<00:00:07.799> Windows<00:00:08.069> RT<00:00:08.280> devices

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
surface and other Windows RT devices

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.419 
surface and other Windows RT devices
into<00:00:09.240> compatible<00:00:09.809> printers<00:00:10.230> I'll<00:00:10.889> say<00:00:11.190> this

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
into compatible printers I'll say this

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
into compatible printers I'll say this
not<00:00:11.700> every<00:00:12.120> printer<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.870> be

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
not every printer is going to be

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049 
not every printer is going to be
compatible<00:00:13.230> with<00:00:13.500> surface<00:00:14.190> RT<00:00:14.400> plane<00:00:14.910> in

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
compatible with surface RT plane in

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.250 
compatible with surface RT plane in
simply<00:00:15.389> because<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> drivers<00:00:16.020> aren't

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
simply because the drivers aren't

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980 
simply because the drivers aren't
necessarily<00:00:16.710> available<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.330> we've

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
necessarily available for that we've

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
necessarily available for that we've
already<00:00:19.189> looking<00:00:20.189> around<00:00:20.279> schools<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.910> we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
already looking around schools so we

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.500 
already looking around schools so we
found<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.480> model<00:00:21.750> printer<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.260> HP<00:00:23.510> 4700

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
found one model printer at the HP 4700

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
found one model printer at the HP 4700
which<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> quite<00:00:25.199> an<00:00:25.289> old<00:00:25.410> model<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:25.920> pushing

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
which is quite an old model now pushing

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.279 
which is quite an old model now pushing
7<00:00:26.670> years<00:00:26.910> couldn't<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> driver<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.109> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
7 years couldn't get a driver for that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.759 
7 years couldn't get a driver for that
however<00:00:28.830> looking<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.090> HP<00:00:30.420> CP<00:00:31.080> 1<00:00:31.289> 5<00:00:31.529> 1

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
however looking down at this HP CP 1 5 1

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.400 
however looking down at this HP CP 1 5 1
5<00:00:32.239> we've<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.390> been<00:00:33.750> able<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> install

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
5 we've actually been able to install

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.319 
5 we've actually been able to install
that<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> simple<00:00:35.070> driver<00:00:35.280> installed<00:00:35.850> over

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that as a simple driver installed over

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.470 
that as a simple driver installed over
the<00:00:36.510> Internet<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.370> USB<00:00:38.910> cable

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the Internet so here we are USB cable

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
the Internet so here we are USB cable
plugged<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.170> printer<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:41.550> gonna

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
plugged into the printer and we're gonna

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.319 
plugged into the printer and we're gonna
have<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> look<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.320> printing<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.620> surface<00:00:44.329> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have a look at printing from surface so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
have a look at printing from surface so
here<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.870> surface<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.559> our<00:00:46.680> HP<00:00:47.070> cp1
