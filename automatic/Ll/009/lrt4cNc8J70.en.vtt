soy games on this but whatever they'll
be<00:05:57.510> very<00:05:57.780> similar<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.200> this<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.650> looked

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
be very similar to this it looked

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.680 
be very similar to this it looked
actually<00:05:58.950> kind<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.370> smaller<00:05:59.760> than<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.300> dsi

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
actually kind of smaller than the dsi

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.630 
actually kind of smaller than the dsi
notable<00:06:01.080> differences<00:06:01.470> are<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:02.100> buttons<00:06:02.340> from

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
notable differences are the buttons from

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.190 
notable differences are the buttons from
here<00:06:02.970> going<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.180> be<00:06:03.270> right<00:06:03.630> here<00:06:03.810> on<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.990> side

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
here going to be right here on the side

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.680 
here going to be right here on the side
and<00:06:04.440> this<00:06:05.160> control<00:06:06.090> pads<00:06:06.270> could<00:06:06.450> be<00:06:06.540> moved

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
and this control pads could be moved

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.120 
and this control pads could be moved
down<00:06:06.930> so<00:06:07.170> they<00:06:07.290> can<00:06:07.410> make<00:06:07.500> way<00:06:07.650> for<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.830> slide

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
down so they can make way for the slide

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.630 
down so they can make way for the slide
pad<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:09.150> design<00:06:09.540> is<00:06:09.750> good<00:06:10.050> but<00:06:10.980> what<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.430> don't

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
pad the design is good but what I don't

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.550 
pad the design is good but what I don't
like<00:06:11.700> about<00:06:11.790> that<00:06:12.210> is<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:13.110> whole<00:06:13.260> thing<00:06:13.290> how

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
like about that is the whole thing how

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.870 
like about that is the whole thing how
you<00:06:13.680> have<00:06:13.770> slide<00:06:14.100> pad<00:06:14.310> then<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:14.640> have<00:06:14.760> the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
you have slide pad then you have the

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.580 
you have slide pad then you have the
analog<00:06:15.240> stick<00:06:15.450> it's<00:06:15.570> like<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.840> PSP<00:06:16.380> but

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
analog stick it's like the PSP but

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.160 
analog stick it's like the PSP but
backwards<00:06:16.770> what<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.580> was<00:06:17.970> preferred<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.690> were

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
backwards what I was preferred was were

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.650 
backwards what I was preferred was were
um<00:06:19.410> they<00:06:19.980> moved<00:06:20.250> this<00:06:20.490> this<00:06:21.270> button<00:06:21.570> the

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
um they moved this this button the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.650 
um they moved this this button the
control<00:06:22.050> pad<00:06:22.400> right<00:06:23.400> here<00:06:23.430> right<00:06:24.390> where<00:06:24.420> these

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
control pad right here right where these

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.480 
control pad right here right where these
buttons<00:06:24.990> are<00:06:25.170> and<00:06:25.410> then<00:06:25.770> they<00:06:25.890> get<00:06:26.310> out<00:06:26.400> the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
buttons are and then they get out the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.650 
buttons are and then they get out the
slide<00:06:26.730> pad<00:06:26.940> up<00:06:27.030> here<00:06:27.180> so<00:06:27.300> let's<00:06:27.420> say<00:06:27.510> you're

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
slide pad up here so let's say you're

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.000 
slide pad up here so let's say you're
just<00:06:27.840> playing<00:06:27.990> zelda<00:06:28.380> and<00:06:28.500> then<00:06:28.590> say<00:06:28.770> you<00:06:28.830> have

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
just playing zelda and then say you have

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.210 
just playing zelda and then say you have
to<00:06:29.130> switch<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:29.550> an<00:06:29.640> item<00:06:29.940> right<00:06:30.060> you<00:06:30.480> just<00:06:30.780> um

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
to switch to an item right you just um

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.409 
to switch to an item right you just um
what's<00:06:32.220> called<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.430> deep<00:06:32.910> I'll<00:06:33.090> be<00:06:33.240> more

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
what's called the deep I'll be more

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.860 
what's called the deep I'll be more
accessible<00:06:33.720> if<00:06:34.110> it's<00:06:34.260> down<00:06:34.650> here<00:06:34.710> rather<00:06:35.220> than

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
accessible if it's down here rather than

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.210 
accessible if it's down here rather than
like<00:06:35.960> this<00:06:36.050> we<00:06:36.200> have<00:06:36.290> school<00:06:36.500> like<00:06:36.650> this<00:06:37.070> is

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
like this we have school like this is

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.290 
like this we have school like this is
the<00:06:37.340> move<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:37.640> then<00:06:37.760> you<00:06:37.820> have<00:06:37.910> to<00:06:38.000> go<00:06:38.060> riding

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
the move and then you have to go riding

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.300 
the move and then you have to go riding
me<00:06:38.390> at<00:06:38.450> school<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.660> you<00:06:39.350> know<00:06:39.440> it<00:06:39.650> really<00:06:40.040> feels

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
me at school I you know it really feels

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.590 
me at school I you know it really feels
like<00:06:40.400> clunky<00:06:40.940> if<00:06:41.030> they<00:06:41.120> do<00:06:41.180> it<00:06:41.420> like<00:06:41.450> that

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
like clunky if they do it like that

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.380 
like clunky if they do it like that
