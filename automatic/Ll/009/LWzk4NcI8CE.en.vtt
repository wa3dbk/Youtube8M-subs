00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.110

 ring but we are also like sisters 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.540

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.949
 Mendez, how do you think that 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.920
 definitely the show has helped their 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.809
 Careers should only learn short 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.479
 ultimate has helped in my career the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.489
 wrestling but not only that I also 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.089
 has helped girls and their children 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.239
 moms 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.979
 showing them that a diva of the ww does not 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.380
 it's only in the ring but 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.920
 also outside because we help a lot in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.920
 community 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.640
 my character in the ring is completely 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.010
 different as I am I am very 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.420
 excited because the doubles w see what 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.700
 happens in my life as I am as a person 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.370
 that can hurt me and the things that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.410
 I live daily obama and I definitely will 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.910
 like to be again or your work with 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.240
 the maxim magazine 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.580
 stoner and spies in maxim japan also 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.860
 It was a great honor to be part of the top 100 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.500
 from maxam when they called me the first 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.020
 time april is of happiness now 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.580
 I'm just waiting to come out on the cover 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.820
 you believe that it would definitely be 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.160
 a successful program if instead of the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.510
 live is also a reality show like the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.510
 of the living for example 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.430
 the show these girls know that the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.190
 boys who work with us are 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 great divas like us I'm sure 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.540
 that the world would like to see them but in 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.460
 this moment what they see is the only thing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.620
 totally needs 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.180
 I know of a superstar who is late 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.180
 an hour and a half to be ready 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.300
 is complete with rosa méndez in 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.300
 World sports point 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 in Spanish and rosa méndez is half 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 Costa Rican and not cost up and for 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.140
 that I speak Spanish not and also that what 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.600
 strange is that there in the interview 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.790
 still if we want to lose the reale 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.200
 of everything for little to take and in the king 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.700
 they also fail, but 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.450
 you know you have to take 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.450
 well because yes no
