00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.629
 The day they tell us is that this is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.059
 one of the three robots in the series 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 gemino and that exists in the world and this 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.200
 he is the only one who has left japan and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.020
 is traveling the world and has 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.949
 come to our other country what is the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.560
 cost equal this cost of theft the see 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.900
 like speech setting 70 26 thousand stable 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.789
 a robot like this costs more or less 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.840
 170 thousand dollars 170 thousand dollars and I 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.270
 you asked in a study that I wanted to know 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.640
 how could they really help us 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.890
 not what function could have for what 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.570
 function could acquire a person like 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.970
 any of us 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.710
 one of these robots clear what we 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.270
 mentions is that those moments this robot 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.120
 is for research but for 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.470
 other things a robot could work 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.470
 similar like this 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.659
 uy weakness in soccer if I encourage 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 robert his performance we do not really 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.479
 where are they if the people 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.110
 buy drugs and does the way you win it on 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.540
 the streets show and they have doubted 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.509
 depending new age legends air and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.479
 space john a people in the beat and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.310
 franklin his day on the roll in the future 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.200
 there are going to be many types of robots 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.540
 we have to understand how and why 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.909
 what people react to one or the other 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.920
 way by now we can say that the 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.080
 people react differently in 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.899
 function to age to gender and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.149
 situation where you are and not 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.220
 talk about roche you can talk to him 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.010
 you can ask questions 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.260
 taking for the moment does not speak us 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.580
 his creator says that later 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.480
 maybe he could already talk to us tell us that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.130
 You can move the lips I have the clips 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:03.100
 like the island speaking jazz day of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.530
 mass activities in degreasing is what 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.009
 that he on facebook picasa and mailing without 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.130
 be able to increase and super- raise makers close 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.910
 expression on facebook facebook the eyes 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 britten wow 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.209
 and here you have muscles in your face that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.209
 allow me to replicate the expressions 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.400
 human this is basically used to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.579
 see the reactions of humans 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.280
 you can see that until they breathe they go to 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.940
 Viana was asking me what worries me 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.349
 little the intention of these robots because 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.690
 good sometime 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.579
 I read a story that in China 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.250
 for example many people acquire 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.410
 baby dolls to serve them the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.329
 company if this would be the function 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.890
 from the study of seeing the reactions of 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.540
 people so that tomorrow 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.970
 those lonely people 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.280
 had a robot company would be 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.040
 very sad for humanity 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.760
 in studies they ask us if the robot 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.860
 it could be a kind of company then 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.630
 for people who feel very 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.550
 solitary this could be a bit 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.550
 sad to be accompanied by a robot 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.470
 this year so michael of repechaje 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:35.240
 a place in people 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.240
 visual drums and said type 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.430
 this minister 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.380
 This is one of the applications 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.240
 can draw from this robot but the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.860
 objective of my research is not that 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.170
 it's not about replacing beings 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.370
 human beings what we are missing are beings 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.650
 humans what I want to see is how 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.070
 human beings interact with 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.070
 robots 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.100
 we arrived
