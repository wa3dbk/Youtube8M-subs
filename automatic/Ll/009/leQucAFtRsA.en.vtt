method<00:01:14.590> I'm<00:01:15.100> an<00:01:15.310> advocate<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.940> applying<00:01:16.720> wax

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
method I'm an advocate of applying wax

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.230 
method I'm an advocate of applying wax
in<00:01:17.260> a<00:01:17.350> circular<00:01:17.560> motion<00:01:17.920> because<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:18.940> believe

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
in a circular motion because I believe

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.790 
in a circular motion because I believe
you<00:01:19.510> work<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:19.930> into<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.110> paint<00:01:20.409> better<00:01:20.590> this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
you work it into the paint better this

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.700 
you work it into the paint better this
way<00:01:20.979> as<00:01:21.220> paint<00:01:22.060> spores<00:01:28.080> since<00:01:29.080> carnuba<00:01:29.470> Gore
