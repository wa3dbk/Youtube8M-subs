way<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.420> lay<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.260> down<00:02:46.530> flat<00:02:46.980> pin<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.550> with

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
way to lay this down flat pin it with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.630 
way to lay this down flat pin it with
our<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.569> short<00:02:48.840> flag<00:02:49.190> pin<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
our to the short flag pin this to the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.260 
our to the short flag pin this to the
ground<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.290> let's<00:02:52.650> say<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.940> top

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
ground and let's say this is the top

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.100 
ground and let's say this is the top
left<00:02:54.660> corner<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.640> plot<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.900> want

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
left corner of the of the plot we want

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.560 
left corner of the of the plot we want
to<00:02:58.200> run<00:02:58.350> our<00:02:58.500> screen<00:02:58.860> from<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.280> corner<00:02:59.610> down

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
to run our screen from this corner down

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.710 
to run our screen from this corner down
in<00:03:01.020> any<00:03:01.530> corner<00:03:01.920> over<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.970> other<00:03:03.150> corner<00:03:03.450> so

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
in any corner over the other corner so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.110 
in any corner over the other corner so
these<00:03:04.020> are<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.530> inside<00:03:04.709> corner<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
these are on the inside corner is the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.710 
these are on the inside corner is the
guy<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.420> does<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.950> aerial<00:03:07.950> helm<00:03:08.340> he<00:03:09.330> lays<00:03:09.569> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
guy that does the aerial helm he lays a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
guy that does the aerial helm he lays a
ruler<00:03:10.020> down<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:11.190> he<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.790> edge

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
ruler down because he can see the edge

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.030 
ruler down because he can see the edge
of<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> number<00:03:12.600> from<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.810> whole<00:03:12.930> bit<00:03:13.170> then

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
of the number from the whole bit then

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.340 
of the number from the whole bit then
we'll<00:03:14.220> walk<00:03:14.400> through<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:15.000> mark<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.840> each<00:03:15.959> nest

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
we'll walk through it mark in each nest

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.020 
we'll walk through it mark in each nest
go<00:03:17.220> through<00:03:17.580> flag<00:03:18.450> them<00:03:18.690> go<00:03:18.900> back<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.260> coney

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
go through flag them go back to coney

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.330 
go through flag them go back to coney

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
double-checking keeping track one two

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.090 
double-checking keeping track one two
three<00:03:23.370> egg<00:03:23.880> nests<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:25.200> get<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> four<00:03:25.680> egg<00:03:25.830> nests

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
three egg nests we get a four egg nests

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:56.780 
three egg nests we get a four egg nests
is<00:03:26.730> write<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.390> bottom

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.370 

you're<00:03:57.790> some<00:03:58.180> predators<00:03:58.569> got<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.930> nest<00:03:59.230> I

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
you're some predators got this nest I

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.640 
you're some predators got this nest I
don't<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.560> what<00:03:59.709> time<00:04:00.900> they<00:04:01.900> drop<00:04:02.200> on<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> hard

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
don't know what time they drop on a hard

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.259 
don't know what time they drop on a hard
surface<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.400> they<00:04:03.519> break<00:04:03.730> as<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:03.970> can<00:04:04.120> see

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
surface and they break as you can see

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.820 
surface and they break as you can see
they<00:04:04.390> let<00:04:04.569> me<00:04:04.660> land<00:04:04.840> on<00:04:05.019> other<00:04:05.140> shells<00:04:05.470> and

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
they let me land on other shells and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.800 
they let me land on other shells and
then<00:04:06.310> they<00:04:06.430> can<00:04:06.580> actually<00:04:06.790> get<00:04:07.090> at<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> inside

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
then they can actually get at the inside

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.380 
then they can actually get at the inside
so<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:08.980> looks<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.250> plenty<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.880> activities

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
so it looks like plenty of activities

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.000 
so it looks like plenty of activities
happen<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:10.930> through<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.680> know<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.830> few

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
happen here through the you know a few

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.130 
happen here through the you know a few
years<00:04:12.280> well<00:04:12.819> but<00:04:13.690> it's<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.930> learned

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
years well but it's like a learned

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.110 
years well but it's like a learned
behavior<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.250> what<00:04:18.519> we<00:04:18.639> owe<00:04:18.729> me<00:04:18.940> here

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
behavior it's like what we owe me here

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:35.640 
behavior it's like what we owe me here
once<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.479> year<00:04:34.139> laughing<00:04:35.139> gulls<00:04:35.320> they<00:04:35.470> don't

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.550 
once a year laughing gulls they don't
seem<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:36.040> understand<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:37.110> shutter<00:04:38.110> laugher

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
seem to understand like shutter laugher

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.700 
seem to understand like shutter laugher
is<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.830> yeah<00:04:39.040> they<00:04:39.550> totally<00:04:40.240> avoid<00:04:40.710> totally

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
is just yeah they totally avoid totally

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.430 
is just yeah they totally avoid totally
avoid<00:04:41.979> us<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.940> then<00:04:43.240> no<00:04:43.510> I<00:04:43.539> feel<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.840> there

avoid us and then no I feel like there
is<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.590> certain<00:04:44.979> like<00:04:45.370> natural<00:04:45.820> selection<00:04:46.240> of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
is a certain like natural selection of

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
learn that but the problem that the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.940 
learn that but the problem that the
Laughing<00:05:03.760> does<00:05:03.940> is<00:05:04.150> they<00:05:04.300> don't<00:05:04.450> learn<00:05:04.950> they

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
Laughing does is they don't learn they

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.710 
Laughing does is they don't learn they
don't<00:05:06.190> learn<00:05:06.430> yeah<00:05:06.820> so<00:05:07.060> all<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.240> can<00:05:07.330> do<00:05:07.570> is

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
don't learn yeah so all you can do is

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.570 
don't learn yeah so all you can do is
just<00:05:07.750> control<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.289> population<00:05:08.950> but<00:05:09.430> there

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
just control the population but there

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.129 
just control the population but there
must<00:05:09.610> be<00:05:09.880> ones<00:05:10.120> that<00:05:10.240> if<00:05:10.510> they<00:05:10.630> live<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.900> be<00:05:11.020> old

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
must be ones that if they live to be old

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.360 
must be ones that if they live to be old
it<00:05:11.289> means<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.590> they've<00:05:11.710> somehow<00:05:11.979> avoided

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
it means that they've somehow avoided

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.370 
it means that they've somehow avoided
that<00:05:12.550> airs<00:05:12.789> or<00:05:12.970> they<00:05:13.180> get<00:05:13.360> right<00:05:13.539> or<00:05:13.720> by<00:05:14.050> chance

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
that airs or they get right or by chance

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.320 
that airs or they get right or by chance
well<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:15.250> know<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.669> reason<00:05:16.000> they're<00:05:16.090> going

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
well you know the reason they're going

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.940 
well you know the reason they're going
that<00:05:16.450> way<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.690> because<00:05:16.810> there's<00:05:17.289> there's

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
that way is because there's there's

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.100

up in the 20s or more that have been for
this<00:05:44.220> it's<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.759> very<00:05:45.000> we<00:05:45.360> got<00:05:45.509> to<00:05:45.630> keep<00:05:45.720> it<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.960> 10

this it's a very we got to keep it a 10

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.629 
this it's a very we got to keep it a 10
to<00:05:46.259> 12<00:05:46.500> right<00:05:46.800> more<00:05:46.979> than<00:05:47.009> that<00:05:47.250> some<00:05:47.490> like

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
to 12 right more than that some like

that<00:05:47.849> right<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.479> I<00:05:48.569> think<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:49.319> also<00:05:49.410> not<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
that right and I think it also not the

deal yeah the population is dropped and
it's<00:06:06.389> it<00:06:06.660> well<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.410> it<00:06:07.680> is<00:06:08.220> stable<00:06:08.490> on<00:06:08.729> it's

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
it's it well that it is stable on it's

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.490 
it's it well that it is stable on it's
just<00:06:09.300> yeah<00:06:09.599> it's<00:06:09.780> gotten<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.139> the<00:06:10.169> point<00:06:10.229> where

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
just yeah it's gotten to the point where

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.620 
just yeah it's gotten to the point where
not<00:06:11.069> not<00:06:11.220> as<00:06:11.340> many<00:06:11.490> birds<00:06:11.789> flying<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.449> well

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
not not as many birds flying that well

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.300 
not not as many birds flying that well
because<00:06:12.930> they're<00:06:13.169> getting<00:06:13.470> mean<00:06:14.009> the<00:06:14.099> others

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
because they're getting mean the others

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.499 
because they're getting mean the others
think<00:06:14.550> they'd<00:06:14.669> rather<00:06:14.849> eat<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.210> food<00:06:15.389> out

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
think they'd rather eat the food out
