it like so you know I'm gonna do this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.419 
it like so you know I'm gonna do this
who<00:01:56.109> is<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.319> like<00:01:56.439> sold<00:01:56.740> into<00:01:57.159> insurance

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429

listed and so that's what I will be the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.949 
listed and so that's what I will be the
integral<00:02:02.020> we<00:02:02.679> go<00:02:02.829> far<00:02:03.159> was<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.700> drive<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:04.420> will

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
integral we go far was the drive I will

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.480 
integral we go far was the drive I will
take<00:02:05.109> it<00:02:05.170> down<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.709> show<00:02:05.859> you<00:02:05.920> all<00:02:06.069> that<00:02:06.219> whole

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
take it down and show you all that whole

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.340 
take it down and show you all that whole
process<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.240> anyway<00:02:07.600> if<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.780> want<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.020> see<00:02:08.200> it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
process so anyway if you want to see it

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.410 
process so anyway if you want to see it
and<00:02:08.560> now<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.800> turns<00:02:09.069> out<00:02:09.310> Satan<00:02:11.880> hey<00:02:12.880> guys<00:02:13.090> is

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
the split the front looks lame I guess

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.990 
the split the front looks lame I guess
it's<00:04:07.530> intense<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.799> kind<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.280> doing<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> at

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
it's intense of kind of doing it at

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.259 
it's intense of kind of doing it at
night<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.660> too<00:04:11.500> um<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:12.870> guess<00:04:13.890> locking<00:04:14.890> your

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
night is too um I guess locking your

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.529 
night is too um I guess locking your
natural<00:04:16.269> curl<00:04:16.600> or<00:04:16.870> wave<00:04:17.280> pattern<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.299> play

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
natural curl or wave pattern get to play

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.710 
natural curl or wave pattern get to play
but<00:04:20.440> not<00:04:20.669> home<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.880> in<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.240> stuff<00:04:22.479> like<00:04:22.660> that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
but not home it in and stuff like that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.330 
but not home it in and stuff like that
so<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.919> guess<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.910> way<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.620> may<00:04:29.620> seen<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.190> it's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
so I guess the way you may seen it it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.910 
so I guess the way you may seen it it's
just<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.750> know

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920
