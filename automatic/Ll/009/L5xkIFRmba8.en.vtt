00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.420
 this single Nokia c6 only single I say the operation of this device 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.760
 AK nonsense Carter Center in Nature of the device on that will be clearly apparent here 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.179
 this button 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.509
 the organizer 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.349
 For the device installed Becker wrote UNMISS that we boot 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.689
 Just wait 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.480
 we have that here for data 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.090
 we have a Disclaimer me an amulet Asbeck or act 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.599
 stand and it is about three com branches off 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.719
 or a diagonal of oh come 1 3 inches moreover we have 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.519
 here a resolution of 640 by 360 pixels 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.380
 and 16 com to 7 million colors 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.550
 the operating system which is installed on the device is that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.679
 operating system 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.190
 Nokia Symbian 3 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.720
 so now the device has started up 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.830
 Phone at the open mouth use his no no 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.950
 and here we just see Nuclear and Katharina Umladen 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.410
 that was all later and now we see here our homescreen Dingermann 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.600
 also individualize show later for the first time since autumn is waived 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 Mailings on it gets back in the action movie Beck 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.940
 and now see how open programs edit home screen here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.960
 Change background is now on legs and so on and so forth 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.140
 Here at the sorting to see our eyes when I'm in the middle there 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.010
 auftrete 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.330
 then you do not have to jump between these three homescreens you expected 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.690
 Vormann in which I over here Vischer 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.040
 or I just take this button 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840
 So then we have to call here because we are shown to improve 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.159
 we can enter a phone number to access open phone book 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.169
 again Options Â»call Close cancel 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.049
 Anything I get to the option attracts Beck 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.789
 Agassi about a message 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.789
 just look at the percent that looks like 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.940
 here in Sanaa to yes speech bubble I get now 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 the message of the really once on it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.210
 so welcome and so on and so on, that's what it looks like 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.269
 or here in this dialogue can then I can write back now 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.079
 can take over the message here to take over 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.559
 and around 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 here collided back 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.939
 soft Trier on and on the homescreen so 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.529
 I do not come back 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.319
 but I will show you again later how to write a message 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.769
 like last time, what else we have functions 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.639
 of course we have the founder was to answer a call 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.010
 respectively 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.370
 when I do their performances 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.500
 then I have the numbers dialed here so a call log as well 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.090
 you in the middle of this physical peg that brings me to my program 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.250
 and to my application and so on and so forth here I can choose what 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.709
 I want to do 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.400
 close and then I hear her after the red hears of course 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.239
 but I can too 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 of course change the profile with it as you can see here 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.520
 when settling and when I have moved closer to him 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.839
 then I come back to the homescreen again and again 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.109
 if I press him long with those on the button then opens mentally 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.169
 on manager moment it just opened the menu that i can then 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.349
 exclude 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.599
 now it is not open anymore 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.979
 yes, I individualized this space Kriens 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.559
 if I put him on the background for a long time 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.539
 do you see LEG you something like that 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.939
 Son then I get his grid- 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.030
 So here are the widgets I can attach to folders I can now too 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.120
 offers to take 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.389
 from different sides I want him to continue online 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.259
 then we see his course here if I should 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:38.539
 then I can choose more widgets here which I then back here 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:39.599
 anordne 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.829
 that's the way foreign countries really look 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.829
 if I listen to the channels Seattle, I'll be there for a long time 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:52.859
 And so again this grid is relatively simple but also relatively strong 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.940
 As you can see here 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.300
 you can only in this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.830
 single CAS drag the widgets order so and now we are still looking 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.799
 once you write a text message 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.649
 Tina Menz menu item 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.189
 Millions we also have a quick access new message 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.399
 and now we have the recipient here and I can paste the text here 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.089
 and then she has the whole painter's phone keypad and I'll just get started 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.089
 Tilt it 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.250
 Whether I ever get into the action movie becker-bender again and again 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.249
 light 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.219
 Well, the keys work well for us and they are good for you 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.900
 they react well 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.469
 You actually forgive yourself relatively seldom 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.639
 Here are more late then have me here is that will be great and 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.270
 lowercase 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.520
 Asterisk and here you can write special characters 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.080
 yes, here was the 1 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.250
 Point and expand immediately smileys 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.729
 that works well 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.220
 Here we have to go further between words like international 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.139
 the others here are German 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.569
 the name he 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.699
 to accept the lines 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.330
 what I wrote 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.729
 and if I turn the device here now then I come back versus 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:08.280
 Artur 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.300
 Of course, here the recorded are much smaller 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.819
 writer 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.280
 but here I almost always meet now I have mistyped myself 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.530
 the whole thing looks a bit more difficult as you can see the topline real 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.050
 no one here we have to Lautern something irritating it is this 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.189
 Clear key 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:30.949
 here is wrong 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.819
 out of reflex, I always want to press right here in Mayen because you're there 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.280
 Rafter delete 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.230
 Brita first test runs delete as the one himself is now the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.129
 round 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.379
 and that is a bit irritating 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.539
 Tecmo Koei 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.900
 Son then my message is inserted here in this 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.089
 News at field 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:53.610
 here can not send 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.990
 the phone book detailed by men 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.290
 and right here 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.979
 At the attachments the datasets may be the message 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.409
 b video clips stops new picture new video 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.039
 new sound since the original note business card 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.129
 and other 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.469
 So this works well because get good insight and we will now 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.659
 test again how it looks 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.290
 when I have a phone call 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.069
 for Osama the dial and I just enter the number one time 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.129
 Mischa with the miniskirt looks when I make a call, respectively 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.169
 what options I have 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.210
 and important, for example 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.990
 how to use the hands-free kit 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.569
 System stops 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.029
 Dulig on it and now we do 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.309
 we had here 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.929
 now comes a diversion since loading briefly but Gesine Schwan sees 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:41.180
 It looks like that 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.410
 here have options as we can see here find the playing field 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.379
 open here we have to stop holding the phone book 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.569
 then came the microphone on and off that in one 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:52.850
 or other situation 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.850
 times relatively important around here with the speaker 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.699
 that's how it looks 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.699
 with salt and water bind hereby the volume rocker 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.089
 and then you realize already here I can believe a new radio play 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.680
 Here you can hold down 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.430
 the complaint of Australia 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.649
 Philippe Erne call the SIM card 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.789
 and loud or quiet WfL 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:35.509
 option 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:39.479
 so bitter that you reactivate aloud and expand the people here you have some 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:40.789
 options 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:44.909
 yes so much for the operation of the Nokia c6 Noir 1 

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:47.949
 another option will be found in the other videos
