this<00:02:27.930> should<00:02:28.110> pull<00:02:28.379> out<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.310> I've<00:02:29.459> already

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
this should pull out so I've already

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.320 
this should pull out so I've already
done<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:31.220> you're<00:02:32.220> doing<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.580> right

here so hopefully you can learn from my

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.580 
here so hopefully you can learn from my
mistakes<00:02:37.470> whatever<00:02:39.140> all<00:02:40.140> right<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.440> next

mistakes whatever all right the next

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.530 
mistakes whatever all right the next
steps<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.819> have<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.650> screws<00:02:43.980> here

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
steps here we have a the screws here

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
steps here we have a the screws here
there<00:02:45.829> there<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:48.560> then<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:49.890> one<00:02:50.069> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
there there and then then we have one of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.300 
there there and then then we have one of
those<00:02:50.220> rivets<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:51.110> behind<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.890> area<00:02:53.250> of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
those rivets that's behind this area of

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
another different push pin this is just

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.940 
another different push pin this is just
one<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.910> those<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:29.230> pry<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.560> off<00:04:29.680> with<00:04:29.890> a

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
then I'm I'll loosen these screws here

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.709 
then I'm I'll loosen these screws here
but<00:06:51.379> I'm<00:06:51.529> I<00:06:51.919> don't<00:06:52.699> need<00:06:52.969> to<00:06:53.029> remove<00:06:53.269> anymore

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
but I'm I don't need to remove anymore

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.689 
but I'm I don't need to remove anymore
for<00:06:54.079> what<00:06:54.499> I'm<00:06:54.619> gonna<00:06:54.769> do<00:06:55.039> with<00:06:55.219> this

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
for what I'm gonna do with this

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.079 
for what I'm gonna do with this
so<00:06:57.219> looks<00:06:58.219> like<00:06:58.279> there's<00:06:58.550> another<00:06:58.759> bolt

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.089 
so looks like there's another bolt

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:02.019 
so looks like there's another bolt
there's<00:06:59.959> another<00:07:00.229> bolt<00:07:00.559> behind<00:07:01.099> here<00:07:01.789> to

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.029 
there's another bolt behind here to

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.119 
there's another bolt behind here to
remove<00:07:02.300> the<00:07:02.509> side<00:07:02.749> fairing<00:07:03.229> then<00:07:03.889> I'm<00:07:03.979> not

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:04.129 
remove the side fairing then I'm not

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:05.559 
remove the side fairing then I'm not
exactly<00:07:04.430> sure<00:07:04.610> how<00:07:04.789> the<00:07:04.999> rest<00:07:05.329> of<00:07:05.419> this

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
exactly sure how the rest of this

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.439 
exactly sure how the rest of this
separates<00:07:06.169> that's<00:07:06.939> beyond<00:07:07.939> the<00:07:08.029> scope<00:07:08.059> of

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:08.449 
separates that's beyond the scope of

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:11.739 
separates that's beyond the scope of
what<00:07:08.539> I'm<00:07:08.719> doing<00:07:08.749> so<00:07:09.499> and<00:07:10.099> this<00:07:10.479> this<00:07:11.479> has

basically the same thing as the left

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.530 
basically the same thing as the left
side<00:07:54.020> except<00:07:55.010> it<00:07:55.130> was<00:07:55.250> kind<00:07:56.060> of<00:07:56.090> a<00:07:56.180> little<00:07:56.390> more

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:56.540 
side except it was kind of a little more

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.870 
side except it was kind of a little more
difficult<00:07:56.960> if<00:07:57.200> it's<00:07:57.380> out<00:07:57.560> now<00:07:57.830> but<00:07:58.070> what<00:07:58.640> I<00:07:58.670> had

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:58.880 
difficult if it's out now but what I had

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.650 
difficult if it's out now but what I had
to<00:07:59.000> do<00:07:59.120> was<00:07:59.270> kind<00:07:59.450> of<00:07:59.540> manipulate<00:08:01.660> manipulate

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:02.660 
to do was kind of manipulate manipulate

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.690 
to do was kind of manipulate manipulate
this<00:08:02.780> piece<00:08:03.020> of<00:08:03.170> bodywork<00:08:03.590> down<00:08:04.250> a<00:08:04.280> little<00:08:04.460> bit

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:04.700 
this piece of bodywork down a little bit

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.770 
this piece of bodywork down a little bit
to<00:08:04.910> like<00:08:05.240> that<00:08:05.480> to<00:08:05.690> get<00:08:06.080> it<00:08:06.200> to<00:08:06.290> come<00:08:06.470> out<00:08:06.500> and

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:07.780 
to like that to get it to come out and

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.970 
to like that to get it to come out and
then<00:08:08.780> it<00:08:08.900> you<00:08:09.230> know<00:08:09.320> kind<00:08:09.560> of<00:08:09.650> fits<00:08:09.860> around

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:09.980 
then it you know kind of fits around

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.070 
then it you know kind of fits around
that<00:08:10.280> power<00:08:10.520> outlet<00:08:11.030> a<00:08:11.060> little<00:08:11.300> tight<00:08:11.510> too<00:08:11.780> so

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 
that power outlet a little tight too so

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.650 
that power outlet a little tight too so
that's<00:08:12.260> something<00:08:12.440> to<00:08:12.560> take<00:08:12.650> note<00:08:12.800> of<00:08:13.040> and

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:13.660 
that's something to take note of and

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.660 
that's something to take note of and
peek
