00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
before working here at ipd and I think

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
before working here at ipd and I think
that's<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.819> important<00:00:45.449> because<00:00:45.479> it<00:00:46.109> lends

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that's very important because it lends

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's very important because it lends
itself<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.969> products<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.449> be

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
itself to how these products can be

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.989 
itself to how these products can be
applied<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.499> real<00:00:49.710> world<00:00:49.789> well<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.850> had

applied to the real world well I had

applied to the real world well I had
really<00:00:51.239> humble<00:00:51.539> beginnings<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.019> started

training there and was able to bring
that<00:00:59.219> training<00:00:59.670> when<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> came<00:01:00.089> here<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.479> ipd

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that training when I came here to ipd

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.239 
that training when I came here to ipd
when<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.199> called<00:01:01.440> me<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.769> help<00:01:01.889> them<00:01:01.979> design

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
when they called me to help them design

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.070 
when they called me to help them design
develop<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.299> do<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:03.870> research

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
develop and and do some research

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.540 
develop and and do some research
regarding<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.860> parts<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.220> thought<00:01:05.430> would

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
regarding what parts we thought would

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.830 
regarding what parts we thought would
really<00:01:05.730> do<00:01:05.850> well<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> Volvo<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.660> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
really do well in the Volvo and the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
really do well in the Volvo and the
Subaru<00:01:07.140> market<00:01:07.440> now<00:01:07.560> yeah<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Subaru market now yeah and I think that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
Subaru market now yeah and I think that
really<00:01:08.670> lends<00:01:09.120> itself<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.690> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.050> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
really lends itself to kind of a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.640 
really lends itself to kind of a
conceptual<00:01:11.040> side<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.730> a<00:01:12.000> design<00:01:12.420> studio<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
conceptual side of a design studio or in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
conceptual side of a design studio or in
a<00:01:13.740> self<00:01:14.010> what's<00:01:14.250> coming<00:01:14.550> out<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.880> mind

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a self what's coming out of your mind

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.650 
a self what's coming out of your mind
because<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:16.440> have<00:01:17.160> an<00:01:17.310> idea<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.360> also

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
because to have an idea and then also

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.380 
because to have an idea and then also
apply<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> real<00:01:19.950> world<00:01:19.980> has<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
apply it to the real world has a lot to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
apply it to the real world has a lot to
do<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.560> works<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.280> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
do with how it actually works and I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
do with how it actually works and I
think<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.730> kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.970> lends<00:01:24.270> itself<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.780> all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
think that kind of lends itself with all

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.360 
think that kind of lends itself with all
the<00:01:25.080> training<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.560> had<00:01:25.800> absolutely

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
the training that you had absolutely

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.370 
the training that you had absolutely
you'll<00:01:27.120> find<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.870> those<00:01:27.930> lessons

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you'll find that some of those lessons

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.050 
you'll find that some of those lessons
learned<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.830> shop<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.310> busted<00:01:29.730> knuckles

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
learned in the shop with busted knuckles

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.360 
learned in the shop with busted knuckles
and<00:01:30.240> scraped<00:01:30.480> up<00:01:30.600> fingers<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.830> translates

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
and scraped up fingers really translates

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.860 
and scraped up fingers really translates
over<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> develop<00:01:33.090> those<00:01:33.300> parts<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
over to when you develop those parts and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.330 
over to when you develop those parts and
thinking<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.440> how<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.800> real<00:01:35.310> world

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
thinking about how the real world

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
thinking about how the real world

plate<00:01:56.460> design<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.940> came<00:01:56.970> with<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
plate design we came with was when we

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
plate design we came with was when we
had<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.230> customers<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> had<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.100> oil<00:01:59.280> pan

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
had some customers that had some oil pan

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.130 
had some customers that had some oil pan
damage<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> Volvo's<00:02:00.600> being<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.900> cast

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
damage and on the Volvo's being a cast

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
damage and on the Volvo's being a cast
aluminum<00:02:01.290> pan<00:02:01.800> it's<00:02:02.100> an<00:02:02.430> expensive<00:02:02.700> part<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
aluminum pan it's an expensive part and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
aluminum pan it's an expensive part and
a<00:02:03.330> fairly<00:02:03.690> complex<00:02:04.080> repair<00:02:04.440> procedure<00:02:04.800> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
a fairly complex repair procedure so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.560 
a fairly complex repair procedure so
there's<00:02:05.220> some<00:02:05.310> great<00:02:05.430> cost<00:02:05.730> involved<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there's some great cost involved so a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
there's some great cost involved so a
simple<00:02:06.960> skid<00:02:07.260> plate<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.710> easy<00:02:08.159> investment

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
simple skid plate can be easy investment

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.850 
simple skid plate can be easy investment
to<00:02:08.819> save<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.149> ride<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:10.200> skid<00:02:10.560> plates<00:02:10.740> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to save your ride they skid plates that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.620 
to save your ride they skid plates that
we<00:02:11.009> use<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.400> typically<00:02:11.700> design<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
we use we typically design off of the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.720 
we use we typically design off of the
factory<00:02:13.140> mounting<00:02:13.470> point

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

where the undercarriage of the vehicle
already<00:02:15.470> has<00:02:15.739> some<00:02:15.980> pretty<00:02:16.159> strong

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
already has some pretty strong

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.339 
already has some pretty strong
provisions<00:02:16.790> for<00:02:17.150> us<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.330> bolt<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.629> so<00:02:18.290> the

design aspect on at least the volvo side

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.600 
design aspect on at least the volvo side
has<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:20.659> become<00:02:20.799> pretty<00:02:21.799> easy<00:02:22.099> for<00:02:22.459> us<00:02:22.580> to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
has really become pretty easy for us to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610 
has really become pretty easy for us to
some<00:02:22.940> respect<00:02:23.299> we<00:02:23.450> haven't<00:02:23.720> taken<00:02:24.290> too<00:02:24.530> many

for<00:02:51.290> our<00:02:51.410> sway<00:02:51.620> bars<00:02:51.859> and<00:02:52.040> mounting<00:02:52.280> systems

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
for our sway bars and mounting systems

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.059 
for our sway bars and mounting systems
like<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.940> now<00:02:53.629> what<00:02:53.930> would<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.109> say<00:02:54.470> is

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
like that now what would you say is

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.020 
like that now what would you say is
probably<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:56.209> most<00:02:57.459> involved<00:02:58.459> piece<00:02:58.760> that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
probably the most involved piece that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.670 
probably the most involved piece that
you<00:02:59.060> get<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.660> get<00:02:59.810> into<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
you get that you get into is it the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.319 
you get that you get into is it the
internal<00:03:01.160> pieces<00:03:01.549> like<00:03:01.700> those<00:03:01.879> motor<00:03:02.150> bit

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
internal pieces like those motor bit

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.930 
internal pieces like those motor bit
like<00:03:02.450> an<00:03:02.569> adjustable<00:03:03.170> cam<00:03:03.379> gear<00:03:03.680> or<00:03:03.829> is<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
like an adjustable cam gear or is it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.030 
like an adjustable cam gear or is it
really<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.780> idea<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.290> coming<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.799> something

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really the idea of coming up a something

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.860 
really the idea of coming up a something
that<00:03:07.160> fits<00:03:07.459> within<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.819> factory<00:03:08.450> mounting

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
that fits within the factory mounting

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.300 
that fits within the factory mounting
bolts<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.379> talked<00:03:09.590> about<00:03:09.709> with<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.099> skid

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
bolts like we talked about with the skid

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.099 
bolts like we talked about with the skid
plates<00:03:10.579> what's<00:03:10.819> more<00:03:11.060> involved<00:03:11.569> or<00:03:11.690> what

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
plates what's more involved or what

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.869 
plates what's more involved or what
might<00:03:12.260> be<00:03:12.410> more<00:03:12.530> exciting<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.220> well<00:03:13.849> I

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
can talk about fuel injection mapping

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.750 
can talk about fuel injection mapping
and<00:03:36.139> half<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.709> people<00:03:37.099> with<00:03:37.250> tuned<00:03:37.459> off<00:03:37.609> the

that lifestyle thing now do you do some
of<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.739> design<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.310> interior<00:03:43.639> the

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
of the design on the interior the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.039 
of the design on the interior the
vehicles<00:03:44.209> as<00:03:44.299> well<00:03:44.329> like<00:03:44.660> some<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:44.989> the

vehicles as well like some of the
internal<00:03:45.440> pieces<00:03:45.829> that<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:45.980> guys<00:03:46.190> develop<00:03:46.639> we

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
internal pieces that you guys develop we

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.610 
internal pieces that you guys develop we
have<00:03:47.389> done<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.569> little<00:03:47.750> bit<00:03:47.930> designed<00:03:48.260> in-house

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
have done a little bit designed in-house

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.550 
have done a little bit designed in-house
first<00:03:49.370> selected<00:03:50.120> pieces<00:03:50.359> of<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.660> car<00:03:50.870> each

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
first selected pieces of the car each

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.140 
first selected pieces of the car each
piece<00:03:51.889> is<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.069> little<00:03:52.340> bit<00:03:52.430> different<00:03:52.819> some<00:03:53.060> of

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
piece is a little bit different some of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.759 
piece is a little bit different some of
it<00:03:53.269> will<00:03:53.389> go<00:03:53.510> outside<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.109> we'll<00:03:54.260> get<00:03:54.410> input

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
it will go outside and we'll get input

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.309 
it will go outside and we'll get input
from<00:03:54.849> other<00:03:55.849> types<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.359> businesses<00:03:57.049> that<00:03:57.200> can

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
from other types of businesses that can

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.490 
from other types of businesses that can
help<00:03:57.500> give<00:03:57.980> us<00:03:58.129> feelings<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.060> design<00:03:59.930> styling

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
help give us feelings on design styling

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.949 
help give us feelings on design styling
colors<00:04:01.220> textures<00:04:01.760> things<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.450> yeah

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
colors textures things like that yeah

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.170 
colors textures things like that yeah
now<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.500> talk<00:04:03.889> a<00:04:03.919> little<00:04:04.069> bit<00:04:04.340> about<00:04:04.549> 3d

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
now you talk a little bit about 3d

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.449 
now you talk a little bit about 3d
mapping<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.780> 3d<00:04:06.200> design<00:04:06.620> as<00:04:06.859> far<00:04:07.099> as<00:04:07.220> building

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
mapping and 3d design as far as building

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.300 
mapping and 3d design as far as building
I<00:04:08.379> guess<00:04:09.379> what<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.620> would<00:04:09.799> call<00:04:10.010> a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
I guess what you would call a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.360 
I guess what you would call a
preliminary<00:04:10.790> piece<00:04:11.419> or<00:04:11.750> maybe<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.739> prototype

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
preliminary piece or maybe a prototype

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.949 
preliminary piece or maybe a prototype
piece<00:04:13.669> you<00:04:14.120> guys<00:04:14.269> are<00:04:14.419> using<00:04:14.569> some<00:04:14.810> real

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
piece you guys are using some real

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.599 
piece you guys are using some real
estate<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.410> art<00:04:15.620> technology<00:04:15.680> tell<00:04:16.400> us<00:04:16.549> a

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
estate of the art technology tell us a

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.699 
estate of the art technology tell us a
little<00:04:16.699> bit<00:04:16.849> about<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.299> well<00:04:18.079> when<00:04:18.470> we<00:04:18.590> go

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
little bit about that well when we go

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.349 
little bit about that well when we go
into<00:04:18.829> production<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.519> very<00:04:19.729> expensive<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
into production it's very expensive to

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.899 
into production it's very expensive to
make<00:04:20.479> just<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.750> single<00:04:21.019> piece<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.500> test

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
make just a single piece to test

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.279 
make just a single piece to test
manufacturers<00:04:22.909> have<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.180> tool<00:04:23.360> up<00:04:23.390> set<00:04:24.200> up

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
manufacturers have to tool up set up

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.839 
manufacturers have to tool up set up
their<00:04:24.440> machines<00:04:24.770> build<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.190> one<00:04:25.370> piece<00:04:25.610> and

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
their machines build this one piece and

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.500 
their machines build this one piece and
then<00:04:25.940> tear<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.210> all<00:04:26.270> down

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
then tear it all down

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.330 
then tear it all down
to<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.690> another<00:04:26.960> one<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.770> make<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.950> single

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340

to do another one so to make a single
unit<00:04:28.610> can<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.730> very<00:04:28.940> costly<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.630> lately<00:04:30.200> in<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
last probably say five years we found

and<00:04:52.730> all<00:04:52.790> those<00:04:52.910> types<00:04:52.970> of<00:04:53.240> things<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:53.690> I

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and all those types of things and I

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.300 
and all those types of things and I
think<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.200> kinda<00:04:54.440> goes<00:04:54.680> back<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:55.070> what<00:04:55.190> we

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
think that kinda goes back to what we

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.460 
think that kinda goes back to what we
talked<00:04:55.520> about<00:04:55.640> about<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.510> know<00:04:56.660> what<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.200> a

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
talked about about you know what is a

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.160 
talked about about you know what is a
conceptual<00:04:58.010> idea<00:04:58.610> doesn't<00:04:59.360> always<00:04:59.660> fit<00:04:59.960> when

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
conceptual idea doesn't always fit when

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.440 
conceptual idea doesn't always fit when
you<00:05:00.260> go<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.650> car<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.730> know<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.030> thing

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
you go to the car and you know the thing

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.820 
you go to the car and you know the thing
that<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:02.660> kind<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:02.960> came<00:05:03.140> up<00:05:03.290> with<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.500> my<00:05:03.590> mind

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
that I kind of came up with in my mind

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.680 
that I kind of came up with in my mind
is<00:05:04.010> when<00:05:04.160> you<00:05:04.250> see<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:05.030> hate<00:05:05.390> to<00:05:05.540> be<00:05:05.660> a

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
is when you see that I hate to be a

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.200 
is when you see that I hate to be a
movie<00:05:05.960> geek<00:05:06.380> but<00:05:06.650> if<00:05:06.980> anybody<00:05:07.400> seen<00:05:07.640> face<00:05:07.910> off

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
movie geek but if anybody seen face off

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.700 
movie geek but if anybody seen face off
when<00:05:08.450> they<00:05:08.540> build<00:05:08.750> those<00:05:08.900> little<00:05:09.140> fake<00:05:09.350> ears

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
when they build those little fake ears

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.830 
when they build those little fake ears
for<00:05:09.890> those<00:05:10.010> guys<00:05:10.190> it's<00:05:10.790> it's<00:05:11.240> almost<00:05:11.600> like

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
for those guys it's it's almost like

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.030 
for those guys it's it's almost like
that<00:05:11.990> if<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.200> see<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.530> that's<00:05:12.740> about<00:05:12.950> the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
that if you see that that's about the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.530 
that if you see that that's about the
only<00:05:13.070> visual<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.670> can<00:05:13.850> think<00:05:14.030> of<00:05:14.120> where<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.330> see

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
only visual I can think of where you see

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.750 
only visual I can think of where you see
the<00:05:14.690> laser<00:05:14.930> actually<00:05:15.770> building<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.310> layer<00:05:16.730> by

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
the laser actually building it layer by

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.430 
the laser actually building it layer by
layer<00:05:17.030> it's<00:05:17.450> really<00:05:17.630> interesting<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:18.110> look<00:05:18.290> at

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
layer it's really interesting to look at

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.370 
layer it's really interesting to look at
those<00:05:18.620> pieces<00:05:18.920> now<00:05:19.820> getting<00:05:20.480> into<00:05:20.660> some<00:05:21.260> of

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
those pieces now getting into some of

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.980 
those pieces now getting into some of
the<00:05:21.470> more<00:05:21.650> advanced<00:05:22.070> stuff<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.670> there<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.540> is

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
the more advanced stuff is there a is

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.390 
the more advanced stuff is there a is
there<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.230> direction<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.040> guys<00:05:25.190> are

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
there a direction that you guys are

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.710 
there a direction that you guys are
going<00:05:25.520> towards<00:05:25.790> is<00:05:26.120> there<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> goal<00:05:26.690> that

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
going towards is there a goal that

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.440 
going towards is there a goal that

and hopefully do really well in solving
their<00:05:44.330> needs<00:05:44.540> but<00:05:45.170> the<00:05:45.560> next<00:05:45.830> trends<00:05:46.370> that

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
their needs but the next trends that

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.130 
their needs but the next trends that
we're<00:05:46.610> looking<00:05:46.700> for<00:05:46.880> really<00:05:47.360> do<00:05:47.570> focus<00:05:47.780> on

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
we're looking for really do focus on

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.710 
we're looking for really do focus on
fuel<00:05:48.770> economy<00:05:49.220> moving<00:05:49.550> into<00:05:49.820> hybrids<00:05:50.270> looking

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
fuel economy moving into hybrids looking

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.060 
fuel economy moving into hybrids looking
at<00:05:50.810> hydrogen<00:05:51.230> as<00:05:51.350> an<00:05:51.470> alternative<00:05:51.830> fuel

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
at hydrogen as an alternative fuel

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.740 
at hydrogen as an alternative fuel
source<00:05:52.340> all<00:05:53.090> types<00:05:53.330> of<00:05:53.420> things<00:05:53.600> like<00:05:53.720> that

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
source all types of things like that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.690 
source all types of things like that
even<00:05:54.080> working<00:05:54.380> in<00:05:54.590> with<00:05:54.770> e85<00:05:55.100> as<00:05:55.550> that's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
even working in with e85 as that's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.130 
even working in with e85 as that's
becoming<00:05:56.000> more<00:05:56.120> prevalent<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.630> market<00:05:56.930> yeah

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
becoming more prevalent the market yeah

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.510 
becoming more prevalent the market yeah
and<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.350> think<00:05:57.560> that's<00:05:57.710> really<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:58.010> hot<00:05:58.280> button

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
and I think that's really a hot button

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.570 
and I think that's really a hot button
right<00:05:58.730> now<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.180> where<00:05:59.510> fuel<00:05:59.930> both<00:06:00.770> from<00:06:01.490> a

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
right now is where fuel both from a

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.190 
right now is where fuel both from a
design<00:06:01.970> standpoint<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.840> management

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
design standpoint of the management

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200 
design standpoint of the management
system<00:06:03.710> but<00:06:04.100> also<00:06:04.130> just<00:06:04.520> where<00:06:04.940> are<00:06:05.090> these

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
system but also just where are these

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.060 
system but also just where are these
fuels<00:06:05.780> going<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:05.960> come<00:06:06.200> from<00:06:06.380> who<00:06:06.620> is<00:06:06.770> going<00:06:07.010> to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
fuels going to come from who is going to

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.770 
fuels going to come from who is going to
really<00:06:07.340> break<00:06:07.610> through<00:06:07.940> we've<00:06:08.360> had<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.540> lot<00:06:08.720> of

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
really break through we've had a lot of

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.660 
really break through we've had a lot of
talk<00:06:09.020> about<00:06:09.050> diesel<00:06:09.710> hybrid<00:06:09.950> you<00:06:10.250> hear<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:10.610> a

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
talk about diesel hybrid you hear that a

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.670 
talk about diesel hybrid you hear that a
lot<00:06:10.790> in<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.090> marketplace<00:06:11.630> it's<00:06:12.110> just<00:06:12.440> who's

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
lot in the marketplace it's just who's

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.750 
lot in the marketplace it's just who's
gonna<00:06:12.830> break<00:06:13.100> through<00:06:13.370> and<00:06:13.460> I<00:06:13.520> think<00:06:13.670> it's

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
gonna break through and I think it's

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.010 
gonna break through and I think it's
