it's going to pass goods and tag which

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's going to pass goods and tag which
here<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:28.170> goods<00:00:28.380> equal<00:00:28.680> lumber<00:00:28.920> fail<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
here the goods equal lumber fail if you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
here the goods equal lumber fail if you
fail<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.760> lumber<00:00:30.029> success<00:00:30.390> yes<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.140> you've

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
fail they lumber success yes and you've

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.530 
fail they lumber success yes and you've
got<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> tag<00:00:32.099> numbers<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.270> basically

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
got to have the tag numbers so basically

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.639 
got to have the tag numbers so basically
we're<00:00:33.750> passing<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> tag<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.790> from<00:00:35.790> there<00:00:36.649> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
we're passing the tag from from there to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
we're passing the tag from from there to
here<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> gate<00:00:38.700> good<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.239> what

since this is some other stuff I was

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.169 
since this is some other stuff I was
working<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.429> keeping<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.149> case

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
working on all keeping in there in case

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.359 
working on all keeping in there in case
you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.200> use<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.649> then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.039> to<00:01:35.100> echo

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you can use it and then you want to echo

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.590 
you can use it and then you want to echo
out<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.179> lumber<00:01:36.539> that<00:01:36.780> much<00:01:36.990> wood<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.789> then

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
out you lumber that much wood and then

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.279 
out you lumber that much wood and then
the<00:01:39.720> total<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.959> you<00:01:43.049> fail

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
the total would and then if you fail

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.490 
the total would and then if you fail
we're<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.450> not<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.599> to<00:01:45.689> act<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.959> go<00:01:46.470> out

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
we're just not going to act out go out

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
we're just not going to act out go out
really<00:01:47.039> anything<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.610> than<00:01:47.849> the<00:01:48.140> fail

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really anything other than the fail

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.450 
really anything other than the fail
let's<00:01:50.099> jump<00:01:50.580> back

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.420 

so<00:01:55.090> coming<00:01:55.360> right<00:01:56.320> here<00:01:56.590> we're<00:01:56.799> splitting<00:01:57.310> it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
so coming right here we're splitting it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.039 
so coming right here we're splitting it
with<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.090> question<00:01:58.479> mark<00:01:58.630> that's<00:01:58.750> why<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:58.930> had

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
with the question mark that's why I had

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.020 
with the question mark that's why I had
the<00:01:59.110> question<00:01:59.500> mark<00:01:59.680> there<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.130> then<00:02:00.850> we're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
the question mark there and then we're

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.530 
the question mark there and then we're
just<00:02:01.060> making<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> action<00:02:01.930> window<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.210> split

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
just making the action window the split

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.149 
just making the action window the split
and<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:05.020> basically<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:05.800> doing<00:02:05.920> is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
and it's basically all it's doing is

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.980 
and it's basically all it's doing is
saying<00:02:06.369> okay<00:02:06.760> this<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.360> how<00:02:07.450> much<00:02:07.630> would<00:02:07.840> you

and then we're going to set the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.870 
and then we're going to set the
innerhtml<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> stat<00:02:17.470> box<00:02:17.770> which<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.100> this

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
innerhtml of the stat box which is this

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.059 
innerhtml of the stat box which is this
box<00:02:19.360> over<00:02:19.660> here<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.959> shows<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.350> wood<00:02:23.069> we're

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
box over here that shows the wood we're

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.680 
box over here that shows the wood we're
going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> we're<00:02:24.819> going<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> make<00:02:25.569> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
going to we're going to make the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.110 
going to we're going to make the
innerhtml<00:02:25.900> equal<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.739> new<00:02:26.860> wood<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.310> then

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
innerhtml equal the new wood and then

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.670 
innerhtml equal the new wood and then
we're<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.690> do<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.019> action<00:02:29.350> window

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
we're going to do the action window

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920 
we're going to do the action window
action<00:02:30.310> window<00:02:30.580> 1<00:02:30.820> plus<00:02:31.180> action<00:02:31.510> window<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
action window 1 plus action window to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.990 
action window 1 plus action window to
that<00:02:32.170> way<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.040> both<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.459> them<00:02:33.550> they're

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
that way you get both of them they're

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.930 
that way you get both of them they're
together<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:36.420> then<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.310> total<00:02:39.730> of

is<00:03:39.530> greater<00:03:40.530> than<00:03:40.650> zero<00:03:40.980> then<00:03:41.310> then<00:03:42.270> update

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
is greater than zero then then update

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.020 
is greater than zero then then update
the<00:03:42.630> value<00:03:43.220> 2-30<00:03:44.220> else<00:03:44.430> if<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.790> less<00:03:45.000> than

sometimes<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.330> forget<00:03:54.480> how<00:03:55.140> much<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.500> really<00:03:55.710> did

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
sometimes I forget how much I really did

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.450 
sometimes I forget how much I really did
code<00:03:57.500> let's<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.770> that's<00:03:58.920> basically<00:03:59.130> get

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
code let's see and that's basically get

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.070 
code let's see and that's basically get
good<00:03:59.610> so<00:03:59.790> you're<00:03:59.910> good<00:04:00.090> there<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.690> only<00:04:00.870> other

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
good so you're good there the only other

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.430 
good so you're good there the only other
thing<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.780> harvest<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.290> other

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
thing is the the harvest in the other

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080 
thing is the the harvest in the other
player<00:04:04.710> if<00:04:05.010> when<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.400> click<00:04:05.640> on<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
player if when you click on it the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.030 
player if when you click on it the
action<00:04:06.390> box<00:04:06.570> will<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.960> go<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.110> attack<00:04:07.770> player

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
action box will just go to attack player

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.450 
action box will just go to attack player
when<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.370> click<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.670> another<00:04:08.940> player<00:04:09.210> and<00:04:10.460> to

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
when you click on another player and to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.400 
when you click on another player and to
be<00:04:11.580> honest<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:12.120> don't<00:04:12.690> know<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.020> that's<00:04:13.170> working

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
be honest I don't know if that's working

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.680 
be honest I don't know if that's working
never<00:04:14.130> actually

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.539 

yeah<00:04:17.290> I<00:04:17.440> guess<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.650> does<00:04:17.769> attack<00:04:18.070> player<00:04:18.310> so

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
yeah I guess it does attack player so

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.949 
yeah I guess it does attack player so
doesn't<00:04:19.150> mean<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.360> actually<00:04:19.630> attacks<00:04:19.840> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
doesn't mean it actually attacks the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.600 
doesn't mean it actually attacks the
player<00:04:20.170> but<00:04:20.410> now<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.680> know<00:04:21.040> where<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.340> go<00:04:21.459> in

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
player but now you know where to go in

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.980 
player but now you know where to go in
and<00:04:21.730> make<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.970> changes<00:04:22.000> when<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.540> are<00:04:22.720> ready

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
and make the changes when you are ready

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.900 
and make the changes when you are ready
to<00:04:23.050> make<00:04:23.230> attack<00:04:23.560> player<00:04:23.800> another<00:04:24.610> thing<00:04:24.790> if

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
to make attack player another thing if

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.910 
to make attack player another thing if
you<00:04:25.000> notice<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.570> goes<00:04:26.230> away<00:04:26.350> after<00:04:26.590> some

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
you notice that goes away after some

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.760 
you notice that goes away after some
time<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:28.150> was<00:04:28.360> part<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.780> innerhtml<00:04:29.080> that

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
time that was part of the innerhtml that

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.020 
time that was part of the innerhtml that
I<00:04:29.830> just<00:04:29.980> made<00:04:30.130> equal<00:04:30.430> nothing<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.000> that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
I just made equal nothing and that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.360 
I just made equal nothing and that
happens<00:04:31.390> on<00:04:31.510> travel<00:04:32.020> every<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.620> trial<00:04:33.070> runs

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
happens on travel every time trial runs

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.300 
happens on travel every time trial runs
which<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.730> at<00:04:33.880> two<00:04:34.240> seconds<00:04:34.690> that's<00:04:35.590> that'll

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
which is at two seconds that's that'll

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.950 
which is at two seconds that's that'll
go<00:04:36.430> away<00:04:36.460> it'll<00:04:36.940> erase<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.480> so<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> way<00:04:37.870> you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
go away it'll erase that so that way you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440 
go away it'll erase that so that way you
don't<00:04:38.110> have<00:04:38.140> this<00:04:38.320> huge<00:04:38.590> massive<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.610> bunch<00:04:40.330> of

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
don't have this huge massive a bunch of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.030 
don't have this huge massive a bunch of
riding<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.200> could<00:04:41.350> make<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> scroll<00:04:41.860> box

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
riding and you could make a scroll box

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.170 
riding and you could make a scroll box
here<00:04:42.250> where<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.490> stays<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.030> just

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
here where it stays and it just

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580 
here where it stays and it just
continues<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.630> add<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.080> that's<00:04:44.200> what<00:04:44.380> that's

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
continues to add and that's what that's

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.810 
continues to add and that's what that's
what<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.860> would<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.070> with<00:04:45.100> that<00:04:45.370> action

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
what you would do with that action

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.080 
what you would do with that action
window<00:04:46.150> in<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.840> array<00:04:47.790> so<00:04:48.790> that's<00:04:48.940> basically

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
window in that array so that's basically

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.730 
window in that array so that's basically
everything<00:04:49.930> everything<00:04:50.380> in<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.530> nutshell

everything everything in a nutshell

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.350 
everything everything in a nutshell
that's<00:04:51.070> how<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.370> make<00:04:51.580> that's<00:04:51.760> how<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:51.940> built

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
that's how to make that's how I built
