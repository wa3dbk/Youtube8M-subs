00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
box below we're now going to cut off the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.679 
box below we're now going to cut off the
edge<00:01:48.799> like<00:01:48.829> we<00:01:49.430> did<00:01:49.580> last<00:01:49.610> time<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.570> we're

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
edge like we did last time but we're

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.820 
edge like we did last time but we're
going<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.930> make<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.229> smaller<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:54.350> means<00:01:54.649> when

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
going to make it smaller this means when

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.679 
going to make it smaller this means when
we<00:01:54.920> open<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.369> up<00:01:55.520> we'll<00:01:55.700> get<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> smaller<00:01:56.299> circle

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
we open it up we'll get a smaller circle

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.719 
we open it up we'll get a smaller circle
and<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.659> look<00:01:59.869> it'll<00:02:00.110> sit<00:02:00.380> perfectly

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and if you look it'll sit perfectly

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.169 
and if you look it'll sit perfectly
inside<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.939> bigger<00:02:02.179> circle<00:02:04.240> see<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.940> now<00:02:08.119> we

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
inside the bigger circle see so now we

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.170 
inside the bigger circle see so now we
want<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.479> glue<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.690> on

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.509

slice now we're going to put some glue

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.369 
slice now we're going to put some glue
on<00:02:30.170> one<00:02:30.500> side<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.159> fold<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.000> over<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
on one side and fold it over so that the

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.160 
on one side and fold it over so that the
flower<00:02:33.590> starts<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.219> take<00:02:34.400> shape<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.849> 3d<00:02:35.359> form

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.270 

now<00:02:39.170> we're<00:02:39.350> going<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> repeat<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.040> without

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
now we're going to repeat this without

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.670 
now we're going to repeat this without
