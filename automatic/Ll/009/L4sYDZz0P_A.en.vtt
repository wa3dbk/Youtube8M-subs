00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that we take off the trans crossmember

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.260 
that we take off the trans crossmember
and<00:01:00.270> drop<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.170> hopefully<00:01:02.270> sounds

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and drop it right out hopefully sounds

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.560 
and drop it right out hopefully sounds
