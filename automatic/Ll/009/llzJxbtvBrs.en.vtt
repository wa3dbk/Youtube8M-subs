00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.880
 little about construction contracts 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.550
 following based on the cpc pronouncement 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 cpc 17 that talks about this topic 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 initially when we will talk about 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.250
 construction contracts we will be 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.330
 always referring to contracts of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 long- term construction of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 example bridges and other types more like 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.779
 for example there was the construction of Christ 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 redeemer is taking five years to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.660
 be ready from 26 to 31 and if this work 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 also long construction works 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 you had a work that took five 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 years to get ready and here comes the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 question how are you going to figure it out? 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 result in this work I expect five years 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.550
 finish at the end of the work the trouble is heard 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.770
 than injury or make a good year 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
 the primary basis of accounting it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 versa about the essence about how we 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.949
 we have to try to observe which is where 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920
 is occurring and sing mensura 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 you as reliably as possible 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 wait five years and have a result 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.439
 final would be a perfect result 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.570
 undisputed since we have a profit 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.810
 already consolidated form is done 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 indisputable 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 however you spend five years without having 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.350
 an annual profit and not knowing if that 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 construction that contract is giving 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.439
 profit or loss 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.290
 It's a very long period so it's better 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 you take stock of what 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 would be the real year year than having the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.460
 absolute certainty at the end of the fifth year 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.070
 that you have suffered loss in every year 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 then not the construction contracts 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 we are going to do a year-to-year calculation 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.110
 that each work without even wanting the work 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 completed some details about the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.649
 construction contract against 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 construction and can be traded for 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.009
 construction of a single asset for example 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.130
 a bridge 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.799
 it is difficult a dam a pipeline a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 road to the ship or a tunnel with it 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.820
 can also contemplate the construction of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.119
 assets that are directly related to the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.879
 related neowin independent in 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.590
 terms of design technology or function 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.349
 for example building a refinery 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.770
 and other complex parts also a 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.050
 plant 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.810
 of industrial plants or equipment 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.940
 then in summary the construction contract 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.690
 can only be for an item on the dam 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.570
 difficult 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.070
 oprah also the contract of 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.760
 construction it can be examined 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.960
 elaborated in several ways. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 all followed that the pronouncement 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.000
 17 they can be classified from two 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.980
 forms or fixed price than that price 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
 where you already leave fixed 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.480
 what will be the value of the revenue or 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.750
 that called more marginal cost 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.360
 I cost light where you have a cost x for 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.540
 construction and its profit margin is 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.600
 calculated on this cost is 20% 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.700
 above cost and so on 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.220
 the revenue from a construction contract 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.960
 she must always understand the amount 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.060
 of the revenue established in the 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.620
 contract or value that is not 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.090
 beginning of the period you had 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.300
 established a contract that would be the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.270
 value to be received by the customer and 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.740
 variations in work contracted in the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.840
 claims incentive payments 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.810
 and any kind of change that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 occur after the start of the contract 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.660
 the cost of a contract and comprises the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.450
 cost that is directly related to 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.660
 with the specific contract of expenses with 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.690
 labor and raw material and at all costs 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.430
 for the work to happen and also courses 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.830
 which are attributed to the activities of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.050
 contract in general terms and which may be 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.020
 allocated a contract and last point 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.600
 other costs which are specifically 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.910
 attributable to the contractor to the customer 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.700
 according to the terms of the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.360
 contract neither as an incentive and thus 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.300
 against 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.250
 courses directly related to the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.800
 which is the first item that we 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.530
 we have named here are the costs that 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
 They are like we already have. 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.840
 directly related to the work 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.780
 then on site labor including 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.180
 also the supervision materials used 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.000
 in the construction of all types of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.730
 construction of depreciation of fixed assets 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.850
 tangible assets used in that contract 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.919
 in that work costs to take or 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.810
 withdraw from the premises the fixed or 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.030
 materials needed for the work then all 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.440
 spent with certain freight 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.930
 the girl project of facilities and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.990
 equipment design assistance 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.780
 also the courses of Ram and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.300
 rectification and guarantee and lastly the 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.310
 third right claims 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.010
 good that can not be attributed to 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.050
 administrative expenditure for the 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.000
 reimbursement is not provided for in the 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.480
 contract then all kinds of expenses 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.740
 mainly administrative and sales 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.200
 and research and development 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.639
 development of which is the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.410
 reimbursement is not provided for in 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.320
 the contract and also the depreciation 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.300
 installations and equipment that 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.200
 not be used in a contract 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.150
 private 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.610
 so it was usually in 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.320
 administrative and sales expenses will be 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.919
 recognized as expenses 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.900
 administrative and commercial expenses and 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.150
 recipe as we will recognize the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.460
 dell's recipe since I'm 45 years old 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.650
 of work I received from a client of a 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.900
 way but I work the work of a 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.790
 another way in a different percentage 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.530
 good when the conclusion of a 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.479
 building construction could be 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.630
 estimated reliably, ie you 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.540
 have a confidence how much time is left 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.490
 to complete that work and the costs 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.720
 also that they will be spent at least 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.900
 estimated 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.060
 you can recognize the recipes and 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.000
 costs associated with unlike 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.780
 then they will be 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 recognized 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.880
 taking as reference the stage of 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.039
 execution stage is the completeness stage of 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.970
 the work is already in progress. 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.970
 ready 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.010
 considering the activity with contract to the 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.370
 the end of the reporting period then 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.110
 summary will be the following percent 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.090
 that work is ready 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.650
 based on this percentage and will 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.510
 know the revenue and cost 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.850
 reminding that there is more than one way to 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.910
 find this stage of components 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.000
 complete is not complete 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.789
 makes measurement of the cost incurred and 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.760
 other methods also the recognition 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.440
 of the recent expenditure, 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.030
 the stage of implementation has been 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.580
 This is what we just commented on. 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.640
 it is usually called a method 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.610
 of the percentage completed or some will 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.230
 call touch is the percentage of 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.360
 completeness of the work 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.220
 the percentage method completed by the 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.570
 contract revenue it should be 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.860
 recognized as revenue in the dr is in 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.130
 periods in which the work is performed 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.140
 that is, according to the hole 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.210
 construction work I will 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.820
 acknowledging recipes speaks daniel espera 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.620
 then with works will only be ready from here 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.470
 three years from now to five years 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.170
 no matter year after year as 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.450
 future building I will recognize the 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.410
 final recipe I'm giving you the 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.410
 construction service
