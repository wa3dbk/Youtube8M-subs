 water 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.170
 hi all the guys are alex e 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.820
 welcome today to this new video 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.860
 before starting the video is true e 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.200
 own of highly advice of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.150
 download this map because how 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
 you can see behind me is present 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.500
 the ultra compact home I presented 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.390
 on my official channel of course 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
 find the link in the description the invitation 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.080
 really to see it because it is 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.770
 really very particular very dogs 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.170
 then together you find the libraries of the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 of the shelves today video however 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.250
 don't focus on that anyway 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.710
 you can also use them to look at them 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.010
 take inspiration from here for yours 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.200
 houses, in short, but today what we will discuss 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.720
 yes yes today we will be talking about fantastic 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.880
 chimneys to put in our rooms of 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.070
 minecraft and in your castles in short 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.110
 this is the first one I present to you 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.560
 version is quite raw as you can 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.300
 see is built with in the kobzon and is 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.250
 very nice to put especially in 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.710
 stone castles these things here 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.720
 because it's a little spartan respect 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 to the others that I will present to you shortly 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 obviously I repeat you must take inspiration 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.229
 from here but not copy and paste with mc 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.240
 edit also try editing the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.200
 yours your ways and your things 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.570
 we can others 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 what you see here instead is another 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.619
 I walk a little bit more smooth a little bit 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.080
 more elegant than before 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.720
 and of course it is always built with the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
 stone so do not put it in short 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.280
 maybe in a modern built kitchen 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.260
 in quartz what you see to mine 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.780
 shoulders instead a bigger path 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.150
 compared to others and would be good 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.970
 maybe put in the largest salons of the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.560
 castles and built and in a way 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.900
 different in the sense that they were 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.939
 used stone slams but a lot 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.479
 smooth one there I never know how it is 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.659
 yes exactly called the stone slab and 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.359
 of the very simple bricks 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.670
 and quite elegant, however, it is also very much 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.160
 impressive very often we can 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.200
 say so well but now let's move on to design 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.410
 modern what sees children behind me 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.750
 and a really nice fireplace from 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.000
 put in your elegant living rooms 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.660
 we can say this because precisely this 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.400
 here is a path built in quartz 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.480
 where above here is here tic for you 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.390
 here it is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.329
 here above is present the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.730
 racetrack lane obviously through these 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.709
 slab these quartz steps from this 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440
 really angular effect a lot that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
 almost looks like a brazier of the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.900
 but the Olympic stadium is very beautiful and 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.220
 very beautiful 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.379
 what you see in front of me now 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.690
 instead it is another modern path from 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.930
 maybe use in kitchens in the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.160
 big kitchens because as you can see 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.609
 to a base of the slam steps of 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.040
 steps and then here are other steps that are 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.140
 were intersected in the slams and then by 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.440
 this effect here and then obviously the 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 upper base made other steps 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.260
 really very nice I call them 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.670
 steps but in reality they are steps but it is 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.400
 the same thing but as you can see 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.069
 of course you can safely a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.190
 It does not burn down anything in short, 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.590
 lan and was that it is raised by a block 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.470
 so there are no problems if you don't have 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.269
 just attached wood down there 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 in short, there are no problems 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.599
 this is the last decided path of 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.480
 present it last because it is 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.040
 really impressive just from the hall of 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.439
 a castle absolutely maybe 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.870
 you can use it on the servers 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.849
 because it is very very very impressive 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.170
 massive especially as you can see 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.129
 was built with the stone that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.069
 the more we can say that more but stone 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.959
 normal in short and they were also here 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.459
 intersected steps with slams 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.859
 to create this effect a lot 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.930
 excavation detail in short of 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.219
 chiaroscuro we can also say so two 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.220
 outbreaks obviously protected by this 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:14.590
 iron barrier and very very beautiful 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.009
 it looks more like a medieval path than 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.720
 in short, I walk from home to a living room 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.880
 well but also for today from minecraft 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.229
 of Italy and of course everything you find the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.870
 map in description that I invite you 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.120
 really very strongly to download them to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.889
 take example in short you can see 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.330
 see everything above 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.860
 obviously we see each other next 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.860
 hello alviano video
