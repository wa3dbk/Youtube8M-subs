on<00:03:17.260> defense<00:03:17.500> chocolate<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.280> what's<00:03:18.490> new<00:03:18.780> so

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
on defense chocolate on what's new so

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.420 
on defense chocolate on what's new so
the<00:03:19.900> gameplay<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.380> year<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.070> focus<00:03:21.310> is

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
the gameplay this year the focus is

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.830 
the gameplay this year the focus is
definitely<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:21.910> defense<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.480> comes<00:03:22.720> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
definitely on defense and that comes in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.930 
definitely on defense and that comes in
two<00:03:23.020> ways<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.500> how<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.740> tackle<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.670> also

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
two ways but how you tackle and also

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.280 
two ways but how you tackle and also
improvements<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.480> zone<00:03:25.660> coverage<00:03:25.990> and<00:03:26.140> so

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
improvements to the zone coverage and so

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.990 
improvements to the zone coverage and so
with<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.860> tackling<00:03:27.250> system<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:27.700> all<00:03:27.790> about

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
with that tackling system it's all about

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.730 
with that tackling system it's all about
the<00:03:28.210> collision<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.900> moment<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.590> impact

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
the collision and the moment of impact

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.440 
the collision and the moment of impact
being<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> drive<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.730> animation<00:03:31.240> so

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
being with the drive the animation so

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.480 
being with the drive the animation so
you<00:03:31.930> won't<00:03:32.080> see<00:03:32.260> Blair<00:03:32.560> suction<00:03:33.070> into<00:03:33.250> another

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
you won't see Blair suction into another

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.220 
you won't see Blair suction into another
player<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:34.480> start<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.780> tackle<00:03:35.110> they'll

player to start a tackle they'll

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.840 
player to start a tackle they'll
actually<00:03:35.410> will<00:03:35.950> not<00:03:36.070> be<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> tackle<00:03:36.550> until

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
actually will not be on the tackle until

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.400 
actually will not be on the tackle until
there's<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> moment<00:03:37.210> of<00:03:37.390> contact<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.230> you'll

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
there's a moment of contact and you'll

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.290 
there's a moment of contact and you'll
see<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.590> player<00:03:38.800> wrap<00:03:39.100> up<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:40.120> that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
see that player wrap up and so with that

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.640 
see that player wrap up and so with that
you<00:03:40.450> saying<00:03:40.690> things<00:03:40.870> like<00:03:40.930> momentum<00:03:41.470> come

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
you saying things like momentum come

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.680 
you saying things like momentum come
into<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> huge<00:03:42.160> play<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.120> you'll<00:03:43.270> see<00:03:43.450> where

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
into a huge play so you'll see where

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.110 
into a huge play so you'll see where
defenders<00:03:44.590> coming<00:03:44.890> in<00:03:44.980> takes<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.730> shot<00:03:45.910> at<00:03:46.030> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
defenders coming in takes a shot at the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.490 
defenders coming in takes a shot at the
running<00:03:46.360> back<00:03:46.510> he<00:03:46.960> starts<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.350> away

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
running back he starts going away

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.960 
running back he starts going away
another<00:03:47.740> defender<00:03:48.100> will<00:03:48.220> come<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.520> actually

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
another defender will come in actually

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.580 
another defender will come in actually
knock<00:03:49.300> off<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.690> first<00:03:49.930> inventor<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.380> change

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
knock off the first inventor and change

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.720 
knock off the first inventor and change
the<00:03:50.740> course<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.010> direction<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.490> where<00:03:51.580> he's

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
the course of direction of where he's

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.550 
the course of direction of where he's
going<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.630> big<00:03:52.870> way<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.200> changing<00:03:53.350> the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
going so it's a big way of changing the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.350 
going so it's a big way of changing the
game<00:03:53.709> four<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.130> how<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.580> looks<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.150> feels

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
game four is how it looks and feels

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.910 
game four is how it looks and feels
because<00:03:55.630> you're<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.320> control<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.740> entire

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
because you're in control the entire

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.500 
because you're in control the entire
time<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.400> at<00:03:57.520> that<00:03:57.610> moment<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.970> impact<00:03:58.060> that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
time up at that moment of impact that

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.120 
time up at that moment of impact that
was<00:03:59.050> zone<00:03:59.230> coverage<00:03:59.620> it's<00:03:59.830> really<00:04:00.040> about

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
was zone coverage it's really about

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.560 
was zone coverage it's really about
tithing<00:04:00.550> that<00:04:00.670> up<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.940> making<00:04:01.150> sure<00:04:01.300> that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
tithing that up and making sure that

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.910 
tithing that up and making sure that
some<00:04:01.990> cover<00:04:02.170> just<00:04:02.320> play<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:02.650> they<00:04:02.740> do<00:04:02.800> in

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
some cover just play like they do in

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.400 
some cover just play like they do in
real<00:04:03.160> life<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.550> you're<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:03.880> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
real life so you're going to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.200 
real life so you're going to
defenders<00:04:04.890> flee<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> routes<00:04:05.460> not<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:06.060> their

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
defenders flee the routes not just their

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
defenders flee the routes not just their
assignment<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.810> won't<00:04:06.930> see<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.080> guy

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
assignment so you won't see a guy

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
assignment so you won't see a guy
standing<00:04:07.470> 15<00:04:08.340> yards<00:04:08.610> away<00:04:08.700> from<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> ball

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
standing 15 yards away from the ball

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.220 
standing 15 yards away from the ball
while<00:04:09.360> everyone<00:04:09.660> else<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.080> other<00:04:10.140> side

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
while everyone else is on the other side

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.660 
while everyone else is on the other side
of<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.440> field<00:04:10.590> he'll<00:04:11.160> actually<00:04:11.310> played

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
of the field he'll actually played

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.860 
of the field he'll actually played
working<00:04:12.240> with<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.420> middle<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.780> field

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
working with the middle of the field

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.570 
working with the middle of the field
until<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.290> receiver<00:04:13.710> comes<00:04:13.860> back<00:04:14.070> in<00:04:14.250> his<00:04:14.370> side

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
until a receiver comes back in his side

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.280 
until a receiver comes back in his side
so<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:14.910> really<00:04:15.030> kind<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.300> making<00:04:15.810> sure<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
so it's really kind of making sure that

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.140 
so it's really kind of making sure that
all<00:04:16.320> 11<00:04:16.860> players<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.280> demons<00:04:17.640> are<00:04:17.760> playing<00:04:17.970> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
all 11 players on demons are playing the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.789 
all 11 players on demons are playing the
cohesive<00:04:18.570> unit<00:04:18.870> you're<00:04:19.380> really<00:04:19.500> trying<00:04:19.709> to

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
cohesive unit you're really trying to

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.530 
cohesive unit you're really trying to
shut<00:04:20.010> down<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.310> play<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:20.910> things<00:04:21.420> like

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
shut down that play and so things like

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.480 
shut down that play and so things like
out<00:04:21.750> routes<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.290> short<00:04:22.560> uh<00:04:22.800> turning<00:04:23.250> zones

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
out routes and short uh turning zones

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.520 
out routes and short uh turning zones
are<00:04:23.670> taken<00:04:23.910> care<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.120> by<00:04:24.450> defenders<00:04:25.200> stepping

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
are taken care of by defenders stepping

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.450 
are taken care of by defenders stepping
up<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.680> playing<00:04:25.890> better<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.280> zone<00:04:26.430> coverage

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
up and playing better in zone coverage

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.880 
up and playing better in zone coverage
so<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.330> really<00:04:27.480> key<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.900> having<00:04:28.200> guys<00:04:28.350> hand

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
so it's really key of having guys hand

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.650 
so it's really key of having guys hand
off<00:04:29.070> defenders<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:29.790> hand<00:04:30.000> up<00:04:30.090> receivers<00:04:30.480> give

offensive<00:05:33.440> guys<00:05:33.650> you're<00:05:34.250> focusing<00:05:34.640> on

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
offensive guys you're focusing on

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.820 
offensive guys you're focusing on
defense<00:05:35.240> than<00:05:35.300> doing<00:05:35.600> anything<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:36.230> allow<00:05:36.470> so

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
defense than doing anything to allow so

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.519 
defense than doing anything to allow so
that<00:05:36.980> when<00:05:37.100> you<00:05:37.190> play<00:05:37.400> gym<00:05:38.350> or

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
that when you play gym or

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.309 
that when you play gym or
got<00:05:40.919> some<00:05:41.309> kind<00:05:41.549> of<00:05:41.579> explosiveness<00:05:42.059> so<00:05:42.719> even

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
got some kind of explosiveness so even

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.409 
got some kind of explosiveness so even
though<00:05:43.409> this<00:05:43.439> is<00:05:44.069> more<00:05:44.549> focus<00:05:44.849> on<00:05:44.939> the<00:05:45.029> defense

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
though this is more focus on the defense

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.359 
though this is more focus on the defense
it's<00:05:45.929> not<00:05:46.109> just<00:05:46.169> about<00:05:46.619> the<00:05:46.829> events<00:05:47.069> often<00:05:47.249> I

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:47.369 
it's not just about the events often I

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:49.129 
it's not just about the events often I
to<00:05:47.429> get<00:05:47.549> some<00:05:47.699> love<00:05:47.909> too<00:05:48.089> so<00:05:48.329> with<00:05:48.779> that<00:05:48.929> the

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
to get some love too so with that the

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.809 
to get some love too so with that the
new<00:05:49.289> taxes<00:05:49.649> it<00:05:49.769> also<00:05:50.249> lends<00:05:50.429> itself<00:05:50.699> to

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
new taxes it also lends itself to

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.449 
new taxes it also lends itself to
suction<00:05:51.749> spent<00:05:52.019> walking<00:05:52.229> so<00:05:52.949> you<00:05:53.039> won't<00:05:53.339> see

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:53.459 
suction spent walking so you won't see

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.429 
suction spent walking so you won't see
gotten<00:05:54.329> defenders<00:05:54.659> kind<00:05:54.839> of<00:05:54.899> coming<00:05:55.139> in<00:05:55.289> and

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
getting sucked into it lock will

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.579 
getting sucked into it lock will
actually<00:05:57.179> be<00:05:57.659> able<00:05:57.719> to<00:05:57.869> move<00:05:58.019> around<00:05:58.169> and
