00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
red bandanas until it went to the

red bandanas until it went to the
cartoon<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.110> changed<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
cartoon and then they changed it so that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
cartoon and then they changed it so that
kids<00:01:32.280> could<00:01:32.460> better<00:01:32.670> differentiate<00:01:33.299> the

characters that's what I did here to
kind<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.659> more<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> turtles

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
open hands to pose them with I think

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.650 
open hands to pose them with I think
that<00:03:17.660> looks<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:18.019> cool<00:03:18.290> haven't<00:03:18.680> imposed

with the open hand the thing where a lot
of<00:03:26.120> people<00:03:26.360> go<00:03:26.930> wrong<00:03:27.200> when<00:03:27.440> they<00:03:27.560> customize

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070

the<00:05:46.220> neck<00:05:46.370> of<00:05:46.490> figures<00:05:46.790> it's<00:05:47.000> just<00:05:47.150> about<00:05:47.360> the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
the neck of figures it's just about the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.910 
the neck of figures it's just about the
custom<00:05:47.900> work<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.170> I<00:05:48.230> did<00:05:48.410> on<00:05:48.440> them<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.860> I

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
custom work that I did on them and I

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.560 
custom work that I did on them and I

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.030 
have them posed the way I like them and
I<00:05:50.630> want<00:05:50.870> them<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.170> stay<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.710> way

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.320 

these<00:06:19.040> figures<00:06:19.400> are<00:06:19.550> all<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:19.790> same<00:06:20.000> body

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
these figures are all the same body

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.490 
these figures are all the same body
sculpt<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.870> only<00:06:21.050> thing<00:06:21.170> that's<00:06:21.320> different

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
sculpt the only thing that's different

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.940 
sculpt the only thing that's different
about<00:06:21.650> them<00:06:21.920> is<00:06:21.980> the<00:06:22.100> head<00:06:22.310> sculpt<00:06:23.140> so<00:06:24.140> all<00:06:24.710> the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
about them is the head sculpt so all the

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.750 
about them is the head sculpt so all the
pads<00:06:25.160> and<00:06:25.280> everything<00:06:25.430> looked<00:06:25.910> the<00:06:26.030> same<00:06:26.710> and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
pads and everything looked the same and

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.250 
pads and everything looked the same and
then<00:06:28.760> I<00:06:28.790> have<00:06:29.210> another<00:06:29.330> one<00:06:29.630> of<00:06:29.780> those<00:06:29.900> hands

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
then I have another one of those hands

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.820 
then I have another one of those hands
that<00:06:30.500> I<00:06:30.590> opted<00:06:31.370> with<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.990> green<00:06:32.990> stuff<00:06:33.320> to

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
that I opted with the green stuff to

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.430 
that I opted with the green stuff to
have<00:06:33.920> an<00:06:34.040> open<00:06:34.310> hand<00:06:34.460> so<00:06:34.610> that<00:06:34.730> you<00:06:34.790> get<00:06:34.880> hold<00:06:35.090> D

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440

nunchucks<00:06:36.440> like<00:06:36.620> this<00:06:36.860> and<00:06:37.130> I<00:06:37.220> think<00:06:37.280> that

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
nunchucks like this and I think that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.160 
nunchucks like this and I think that
comes<00:06:37.760> out<00:06:37.940> great<00:06:38.120> I've<00:06:38.420> got<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.840> clear

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.920 
comes out great I've got the clear
plastic<00:06:39.380> bands<00:06:39.860> that<00:06:40.130> come<00:06:40.310> on<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.600> figures

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
plastic bands that come on the figures

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.430 
plastic bands that come on the figures
on<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.500> accessories<00:06:42.980> when<00:06:43.160> you<00:06:43.220> get<00:06:43.370> them<00:06:43.550> and

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
on the accessories when you get them and

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.400 
on the accessories when you get them and
then<00:06:45.440> on<00:06:45.860> this<00:06:46.070> nunchuck<00:06:46.520> here<00:06:47.000> I've<00:06:47.840> got<00:06:48.170> wire

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
then on this nunchuck here I've got wire

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.020 
then on this nunchuck here I've got wire

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
wrapped around it you can see so that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.930 
wrapped around it you can see so that
it's<00:06:50.270> posed<00:06:50.510> like<00:06:50.720> he's<00:06:50.930> swinging<00:06:51.320> it<00:06:51.410> and<00:06:52.370> up
