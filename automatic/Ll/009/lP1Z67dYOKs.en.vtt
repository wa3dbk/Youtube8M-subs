the<00:00:03.760> 34<00:00:04.450> gone<00:00:04.629> so<00:00:04.899> long<00:00:04.930> I<00:00:05.109> filled<00:00:05.500> up<00:00:05.939> when<00:00:06.939> I

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
the 34 gone so long I filled up when I

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.209 
the 34 gone so long I filled up when I
did<00:00:07.330> fill<00:00:07.810> it<00:00:07.930> up<00:00:08.020> I<00:00:08.200> did<00:00:08.349> have<00:00:08.500> a<00:00:08.559> problem<00:00:09.010> with

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
did fill it up I did have a problem with

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.299 
did fill it up I did have a problem with
the<00:00:09.840> gurgling<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:11.320> thought<00:00:11.980> it<00:00:12.099> was<00:00:12.190> the

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
the gurgling the thought it was the

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.789 
the gurgling the thought it was the
plumbing<00:00:12.700> but<00:00:13.420> end<00:00:13.719> up<00:00:13.839> being<00:00:14.049> the<00:00:14.170> return

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
plumbing but end up being the return

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.280 
plumbing but end up being the return
pump<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.910> course<00:00:16.180> that's<00:00:16.330> expected<00:00:16.780> with<00:00:17.110> the

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
pump of course that's expected with the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.330 
pump of course that's expected with the
640<00:00:18.220> gallon<00:00:18.580> per<00:00:18.760> hour<00:00:19.200> so<00:00:20.200> what<00:00:20.710> I'm<00:00:20.800> doing<00:00:21.100> I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
640 gallon per hour so what I'm doing I

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.840 
640 gallon per hour so what I'm doing I
went<00:00:21.730> ahead<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:21.970> lowered<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.130> water<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:24.700> that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
went ahead and lowered the water so that

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.150 
went ahead and lowered the water so that
it<00:00:24.910> wouldn't<00:00:25.150> overflow<00:00:25.690> and<00:00:25.960> so<00:00:26.770> I<00:00:26.800> can<00:00:27.040> go

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
it wouldn't overflow and so I can go

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.880 
it wouldn't overflow and so I can go
ahead<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:27.370> mess<00:00:27.580> with<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.940> drain<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:29.740> going

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
ahead and mess with the drain I'm going

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.940 
ahead and mess with the drain I'm going
to<00:00:29.980> go<00:00:30.100> ahead<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:31.170> disconnect<00:00:32.170> the<00:00:32.410> hose<00:00:32.650> and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
to go ahead and disconnect the hose and

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.550 
to go ahead and disconnect the hose and
I'm<00:00:33.490> going<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.700> connect<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.390> ball<00:00:35.200> valve<00:00:35.410> right

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
I'm going to connect a ball valve right

I'm going to connect a ball valve right
here<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.490> ball<00:00:36.760> valve<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.690> three-quarter

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
here the ball valve is the three-quarter

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.830 
here the ball valve is the three-quarter
inch<00:00:38.590> I've<00:00:38.980> already<00:00:39.220> glued<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.820> it's<00:00:40.540> the

inch I've already glued it it's the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.950 
inch I've already glued it it's the
cured<00:00:41.290> for<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.830> while<00:00:42.420> probably<00:00:43.420> about<00:00:43.690> an<00:00:43.840> at

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
I was having was I had to change the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.910 
I was having was I had to change the
settings<00:01:07.630> on<00:01:07.750> my<00:01:07.780> controller<00:01:08.290> had<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.710> lower

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
settings on my controller had to lower

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.340 
settings on my controller had to lower
the<00:01:09.190> UV<00:01:09.610> all<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.390> way<00:01:10.479> down<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.690> zero<00:01:11.050> I'm

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
the UV all the way down to zero I'm

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.980 
the UV all the way down to zero I'm
turned<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.040> Reds<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.580> green<00:01:12.990> because

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
turned on the Reds the green because

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.530 
turned on the Reds the green because
when<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.740> was<00:01:14.950> doing<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.460> had<00:01:15.640> these<00:01:16.330> crazy

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
when I was doing it I had these crazy

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.010 
when I was doing it I had these crazy
lines<00:01:16.990> running<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.920> down<00:01:18.010> on<00:01:18.700> my<00:01:19.020> camera

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
lines running up and down on my camera

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.289 
lines running up and down on my camera
and<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:21.250> thought<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.580> was<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:21.820> because<00:01:21.940> I<00:01:22.180> was

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
and I thought it was just because I was

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.500 
and I thought it was just because I was
using<00:01:22.540> my<00:01:22.750> cell<00:01:23.020> phone<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.530> even<00:01:24.100> uh<00:01:24.420> busted<00:01:25.420> out

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
using my cell phone I even uh busted out

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.260 
using my cell phone I even uh busted out
the<00:01:25.540> DSLR<00:01:26.320> camera<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.159> try<00:01:27.700> shooting<00:01:27.880> video

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the DSLR camera and try shooting video

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.100 
the DSLR camera and try shooting video
with<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.170> was<00:01:29.320> just<00:01:29.560> as<00:01:29.710> bad<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
with that and it was just as bad so the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.030 
with that and it was just as bad so the
lights<00:01:32.650> do<00:01:32.979> play<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:34.299> factor<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.350> with<00:01:35.530> what

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
lights do play a factor in it with what

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.469 
lights do play a factor in it with what
that<00:01:36.190> leaves<00:01:36.400> me<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:37.290> there<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.710> plumbing

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that leaves me on there is the plumbing

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.260 
that leaves me on there is the plumbing
absolutely<00:01:40.500> no<00:01:41.500> leaks<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.190> I<00:01:42.369> use<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.909> two

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
absolutely no leaks and I use that a two

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.679 
absolutely no leaks and I use that a two
by<00:01:43.299> four<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.810> catch<00:01:44.049> any<00:01:44.590> excess<00:01:45.280> glue<00:01:45.689> coming

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
by four to catch any excess glue coming

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.690 
by four to catch any excess glue coming
off<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.990> pipe<00:01:47.830> when<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.130> was<00:01:48.250> learning<00:01:48.400> it

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
off of the pipe when I was learning it

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.530 
off of the pipe when I was learning it
here<00:01:49.710> let's<00:01:50.710> take<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> look<00:01:51.220> at<00:01:51.400> my<00:01:51.580> drains<00:01:52.210> I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
here let's take a look at my drains I

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.060 
here let's take a look at my drains I
just<00:01:53.020> connected<00:01:53.290> up<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.689> know<00:01:55.830> clear<00:01:56.830> hose

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
just connected up to you know clear hose

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.520 
just connected up to you know clear hose
that's<00:01:58.060> how<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.600> for<00:01:58.630> now<00:01:58.840> I'll<00:01:59.259> probably

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
that's how it is for now I'll probably

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.070 
that's how it is for now I'll probably
clean<00:01:59.830> it<00:01:59.979> up<00:02:00.130> I'm<00:02:00.909> not<00:02:01.060> too<00:02:01.240> happy<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
clean it up I'm not too happy with the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.640
