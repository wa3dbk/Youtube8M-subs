working pretty good

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
working pretty good
I<00:00:59.609> had<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> fiddle<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I had to fiddle with it a little bit to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
I had to fiddle with it a little bit to
get<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> air<00:01:01.920> flow<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
get the air flow right just because if I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
get the air flow right just because if I
didn't<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.769> had<00:01:04.799> my<00:01:05.040> vents<00:01:05.400> open<00:01:05.580> enough

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
didn't think I had my vents open enough

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.830 
didn't think I had my vents open enough
it<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.900> causing<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.530> pressure<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.840> working

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it was causing back pressure so working

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
it was causing back pressure so working
great<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:11.119> have<00:01:12.119> run<00:01:12.390> through<00:01:12.659> quite<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> bit

lose<00:02:06.890> too<00:02:07.100> much<00:02:07.250> heat<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.070> thing's

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
lose too much heat so this thing's
