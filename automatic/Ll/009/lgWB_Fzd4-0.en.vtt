00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
flights but I quite badly about five

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
know we came in and did the driver

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
again but you know he has got a long way

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.369 
again but you know he has got a long way
to<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.690> anyway<00:02:12.690> we'll<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:12.959> what<00:02:13.260> it's

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
to go so anyway we'll see what it's

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.869
