00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 on the other hand in the chapter of the exploits of 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.730
 this French transatlantic there is the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 performance of arthaud florence she has 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.400
 been the first woman on arrival you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 know and especially she ranked 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.049
 11th ie a very good place 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.120
 you've heard it already briefly this 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 evening I propose to listen to the story 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.060
 she did to salviac stone of her 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.590
 race 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.210
 arthaud florence I suffered but 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.070
 never to longlines was ever because 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 that you my retirement is at 100 it serves to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
 I would have never regretted 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.199
 I blew moments I really 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.810
 wanted to lift the foot of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.759
 to go to sleep 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 I say to myself every time good bah you 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.350
 you go astray you keep your way 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.900
 you go for too bad discovered the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.150
 instructions and returns from the law this this 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.260
 and then I left again would never say 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.760
 huh long but there was always 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.470
 often when there is stuff that was going 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.699
 not that they broke caused maximum and 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.920
 some next door we could see that 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.839
 did not work we always have moments 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.059
 where we have but really but the bowl 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.890
 fed up month the end is like that to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.670
 the time I was on my neck he I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.409
 screaming the insult finally I think it was 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 and then good after I did not resume 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.680
 I act and have taken action 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.560
 continues we continue to say that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.909
 made the mood in this race was 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.470
 you had to think of nothing else 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.060
 nothing but the race that his 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 skis and we have ruts 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.580
 we do not live fully it went quickly 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 always been possible but neither his boat 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 at most, whatever our states 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.360
 of soul no matter how tired we are 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.750
 health by that the physical form is well 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920
 what to think about it, especially not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 to tell oneself 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.549
 finally, I do not know, we do not have the leisure 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 the leisure of having to deal with other 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.939
 thing and we do not have the leisure either 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 to think of something else 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.930
 florence you carry on your hands the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.140
 bruises of the court so what have 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 been the most painful times to 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 it was me I think the kids in 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.750
 most painful holiday I do not know 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.159
 really this one is when it's 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 breaks and because the morale of his nose 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.320
 completely because when when you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.850
 fucked from the start you sleep 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 not that we do the maximum that you are 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.770
 punctured and that finally you do yourself 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.240
 the maximum but that is the material 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.710
 who loose is underneath that it has 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.229
 really one until July but that's 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.030
 disgusting and page and that's what I 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.060
 know it's not normal 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 it must happen and we are stopped we lose 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.580
 of execrable time because it's because 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.230
 that it's the things on the boat that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.230
 breaks when we do the maximum
