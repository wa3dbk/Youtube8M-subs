you get up to seven home screens and
let's<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> Android<00:02:02.790> version<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
let's look at the Android version it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.980 
let's look at the Android version it
should<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.829> 4.2<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.070> mean<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.659> modified

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
should be 4.2 I mean they have modified

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.320 
should be 4.2 I mean they have modified
as<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.649> samsung<00:02:08.550> has<00:02:08.700> modified<00:02:08.970> now

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
as you can see samsung has modified now

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839 
as you can see samsung has modified now
we<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.690> tabs<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
we have tabs here and I think so it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.850 
we have tabs here and I think so it
should<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.209> in

camera the camera is a 13 megapixel

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.380 
camera the camera is a 13 megapixel
shooter<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.979> we<00:04:43.979> do<00:04:44.190> get<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.580> tap<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.210> focus

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.590 
shooter and we do get this tap to focus
functionality<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:47.150> again<00:04:48.150> there<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.450> no

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
functionality and again there is no

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.780 
functionality and again there is no
shuttle<00:04:49.020> at<00:04:49.140> it's<00:04:49.350> instant<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.130> will<00:04:50.310> say<00:04:50.520> and

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
shuttle at it's instant I will say and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.450 
shuttle at it's instant I will say and
this<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.810> mode<00:04:52.050> button<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.530> we<00:04:53.160> have<00:04:53.250> seen

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
this is the mode button and we have seen

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460 
this is the mode button and we have seen
this<00:04:53.669> ribbon<00:04:54.030> interface<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.840> Galaxy

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
this ribbon interface in the Galaxy

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.760 
this ribbon interface in the Galaxy
camera<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.330> reviewed<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.810> few<00:04:57.840> weeks<00:04:58.560> ago

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
camera that I reviewed a few weeks ago

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.090 
camera that I reviewed a few weeks ago
so<00:04:59.430> we<00:04:59.850> see<00:05:00.060> that<00:05:00.240> one<00:05:00.510> I'll<00:05:01.440> be<00:05:01.680> testing<00:05:01.830> the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
so we see that one I'll be testing the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.040 
so we see that one I'll be testing the
camera<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.490> lot<00:05:02.729> more<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.330> I'll<00:05:03.750> make<00:05:03.960> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
camera a lot more and I'll make a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.680 
camera a lot more and I'll make a
dedicated<00:05:04.440> video<00:05:04.680> regarding<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
dedicated video regarding that but the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.540 
dedicated video regarding that but the
camera<00:05:06.960> performance<00:05:07.320> looks<00:05:07.590> pretty<00:05:08.190> good<00:05:08.490> I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
camera performance looks pretty good I

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.430 
camera performance looks pretty good I
would<00:05:08.760> say<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:08.970> let's<00:05:09.240> preview<00:05:10.080> those

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
would say so let's preview those

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.310 
would say so let's preview those
pictures<00:05:11.450> this<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.690> one<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.050> we<00:05:13.200> took

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
pictures this is the one that we took

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.860 
pictures this is the one that we took
let's<00:05:13.530> zoom<00:05:13.890> in<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.680> flash<00:05:16.860> did<00:05:17.070> not<00:05:17.190> fire

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
let's zoom in and the flash did not fire

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.900 
let's zoom in and the flash did not fire
so<00:05:21.590> looks<00:05:22.590> pretty<00:05:23.220> nice

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
so looks pretty nice

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.150 
so looks pretty nice
as<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.419> now<00:05:27.050> so<00:05:28.050> let<00:05:28.200> me<00:05:28.350> get<00:05:28.500> out<00:05:28.620> of<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.890> one

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
as of now so let me get out of that one

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.580 
as of now so let me get out of that one
again<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.960> phone

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
again the phone

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.219 
again the phone
is<00:05:32.280> comfortable<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:33.210> hold<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.600> width<00:05:33.840> hasn't

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
is comfortable to hold the width hasn't

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.110 
is comfortable to hold the width hasn't
been<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.530> great<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:35.160> if<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.789> have<00:05:35.910> already

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
been in great so if you have already

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.810 
been in great so if you have already
used<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.599> s3<00:05:37.050> look<00:05:37.380> actually<00:05:37.590> very<00:05:38.130> familiar

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
used the s3 look actually very familiar

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.670 
used the s3 look actually very familiar
I<00:05:38.880> would<00:05:39.120> say<00:05:39.330> also<00:05:40.200> let's<00:05:40.620> look<00:05:40.860> at<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.220> gap

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
I would say also let's look at the gap

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.680 
I would say also let's look at the gap
and<00:05:41.949> we<00:05:42.070> have<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.639> view<00:05:42.910> if<00:05:43.090> we<00:05:43.150> use<00:05:43.540> this

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
and we have that a view if we use this

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.900 
and we have that a view if we use this
to<00:05:43.930> finger<00:05:44.259> swipes<00:05:44.560> like<00:05:44.830> this<00:05:45.100> you<00:05:45.729> get

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
to finger swipes like this you get

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.999 
to finger swipes like this you get
access<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.300> all<00:05:46.660> these<00:05:46.870> toggles<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:47.740> as<00:05:47.889> you

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
access to all these toggles and as you

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.760 
access to all these toggles and as you
can<00:05:48.130> see<00:05:48.190> we<00:05:48.460> have<00:05:48.720> lot<00:05:49.720> more<00:05:49.750> toggles<00:05:50.530> this

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
can see we have lot more toggles this

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.170 
can see we have lot more toggles this
time<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:52.500> we<00:05:53.500> have<00:05:53.650> things<00:05:54.430> like<00:05:54.550> smart

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
time and we have things like smart

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.620 
time and we have things like smart
scroll<00:05:55.449> etc<00:05:56.190> Samsung<00:05:57.190> has<00:05:57.370> also<00:05:57.580> added<00:05:58.090> a<00:05:58.300> lot

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
scroll etc Samsung has also added a lot

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.810 
scroll etc Samsung has also added a lot
of<00:05:58.660> air<00:05:59.139> gestures<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.520> think<00:06:00.729> so<00:06:00.789> that

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
of air gestures and I think so that

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.540 
of air gestures and I think so that
works<00:06:01.389> in<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.720> gallery<00:06:02.139> so<00:06:02.440> let's<00:06:02.800> open<00:06:03.160> up

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550
