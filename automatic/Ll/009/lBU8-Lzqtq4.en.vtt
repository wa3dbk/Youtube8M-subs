i'm<00:00:32.730> always<00:00:32.820> up<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.239> new<00:00:33.270> things<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
i'm always up for new things but it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.209 
i'm always up for new things but it's
been<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> great<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> half<00:00:34.649> year<00:00:34.829> run<00:00:34.980> but

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
been a great two and a half year run but

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.229 
been a great two and a half year run but
we're<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.520> thinking<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> go

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
we're really thinking it's going to go

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
we're really thinking it's going to go
it'd<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> our<00:00:36.600> Olympic<00:00:37.050> season<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.559> we're<00:00:37.680> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it'd be our Olympic season so we're just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.979 
it'd be our Olympic season so we're just
keeping<00:00:37.920> our<00:00:38.129> fingers<00:00:38.219> crossed<00:00:38.399> thank<00:00:39.210> ya<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
keeping our fingers crossed thank ya and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.209 
keeping our fingers crossed thank ya and
it'd<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.739> cool<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.010> it'd<00:00:41.129> be

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it'd be really cool because it'd be

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
it'd be really cool because it'd be
coinciding<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> Olympics<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.559> it'd<00:00:43.559> be

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
coinciding with the Olympics and it'd be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
coinciding with the Olympics and it'd be
our<00:00:43.800> best<00:00:44.070> season<00:00:44.489> yet<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.239> this

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
our best season yet I think because this

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.819 
our best season yet I think because this
is<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> girls<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> show<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.710> been

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is what the girls in the show have been

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
is what the girls in the show have been
waiting<00:00:47.460> their<00:00:47.550> whole<00:00:47.579> lives<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.239> Olympic

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
waiting their whole lives for is Olympic

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.110 
waiting their whole lives for is Olympic
so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so I think if you know if we do go to a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.160 
so I think if you know if we do go to a
third<00:00:51.300> season<00:00:51.420> I'll<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> best<00:00:51.930> season<00:00:52.140> yet

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
third season I'll be the best season yet

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
third season I'll be the best season yet
