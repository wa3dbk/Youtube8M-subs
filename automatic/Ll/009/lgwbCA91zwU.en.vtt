of<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.150> messages<00:00:24.330> I've<00:00:24.750> been<00:00:24.900> getting<00:00:25.230> mainly

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
of the messages I've been getting mainly

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
of the messages I've been getting mainly
with<00:00:26.040> my<00:00:26.160> theory<00:00:26.610> that<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.939> next<00:00:27.210> main<00:00:27.390> lines

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with my theory that the next main lines

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.650 
with my theory that the next main lines
all<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.899> tile<00:00:28.259> be<00:00:28.470> released<00:00:28.829> in<00:00:29.040> 2015<00:00:29.520> or<00:00:29.939> 2060

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
all the tile be released in 2015 or 2060

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
all the tile be released in 2015 or 2060
and<00:00:30.899> it<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.290> a<00:00:31.320> theory<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.340> saying<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and it is a theory I'm not saying it's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.960 
and it is a theory I'm not saying it's
solid<00:00:33.630> proof<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:35.100> however<00:00:35.399> my<00:00:35.790> main

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
solid proof here but however my main

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.970 
solid proof here but however my main
reasons<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.360> stating<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:37.860> the

we're expecting a review of a new

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.760 
we're expecting a review of a new
mainline<00:03:53.970> title<00:03:54.390> when<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.020> mean<00:03:55.230> by<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.560> is

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
mainline title when I mean by that is

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.560 
mainline title when I mean by that is
that<00:03:55.800> Hyrule<00:03:56.310> warriors<00:03:56.340> isn't<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
that Hyrule warriors isn't the one and

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.240 
that Hyrule warriors isn't the one and
heavy<00:03:57.750> development<00:03:58.380> with<00:03:58.530> development<00:03:59.040> team

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
heavy development with development team

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.250 
heavy development with development team
number<00:03:59.550> three<00:03:59.580> the<00:04:00.390> reason<00:04:00.660> why<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.840> say<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
number three the reason why I say that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.200 
number three the reason why I say that
is<00:04:01.650> because<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.280> team<00:04:02.580> has<00:04:02.700> been<00:04:02.850> confirmed

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
is because the team has been confirmed

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.030 
is because the team has been confirmed
to<00:04:03.330> be<00:04:03.390> working<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.960> new<00:04:04.110> title<00:04:04.380> since

to be working on a new title since

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.140 
to be working on a new title since
either<00:04:05.390> 2009<00:04:06.390> 2010<00:04:07.080> or<00:04:07.470> 2011<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.790> doubt

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
either 2009 2010 or 2011 and I doubt

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.240 
either 2009 2010 or 2011 and I doubt
they<00:04:09.390> use<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.900> much<00:04:10.110> time<00:04:10.530> for<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> spin-off

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250
