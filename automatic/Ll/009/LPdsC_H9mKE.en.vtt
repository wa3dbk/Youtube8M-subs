00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.969
 other maps but is good it is 4 x 4 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.920
 you notice 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.430

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:09.080
 middle is the gold is every map 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.850
 simply yes okay is not our way and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 I've just noticed here the 'big 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.370
 one 'after one is always so a distance 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:23.720
 I have to take another front 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:27.130

 pickaxe with but I do not know where 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.959
 One thing is clear that there is the gold and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.250
 weg.de simply away there is not even that 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.250
 gold is iron aid 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.230
 but that 's gold or yes that's it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.650
 money very nice then you disappear 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.140

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.109
 jojo walter 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.970
 that means I have three gold three gold 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.730
 I brought home people 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.519

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.519
 brought three gold home 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.209
 I am the captain with three gold can 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.919
 unfortunately you do not start much 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.760
 Unfortunately, because the sword costs now 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.040
 five gold and one bow costs three 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.239
 gold and then I still need 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.239
 additionally an arrow 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.620
 it could be a bit quiet 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.000
 make people easier 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.139
 I can not look right now 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.579
 Although now already make the bow here 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.949
 so at infiniti reminds me of that 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.660
 song then would have to press here then 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:07.359
 to be iron if I'm right 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.709
 or yes exactly there are two pieces yes 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.910
 maybe a bit more me 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.470
 stay a little bit well 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.660

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.940

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.040
 straight from today 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.590
 that has been wise to stand safe 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.350
 the internet is the only one left 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.640
 that still stands the 10th 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.600
 our bed is the only one left 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.160
 I need three iron and seven 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.590
 Iron is ten iron I need 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.540
 Automatically count well five iron 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.710
 yet I could about bomba da 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.280
 Nobody was over there when I was there 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.290
 therefore over construction and I do not want however 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.380
 what I try now 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.340

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.460

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.410

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.560
 but team red does not get to us 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.250
 that's a bit bad for me now 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.940
 do not know where team red is the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.790
