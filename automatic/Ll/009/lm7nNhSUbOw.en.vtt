access to the impeller we have our whole
schooling<00:00:57.329> system<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.559> each

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
schooling system here is the they each

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
schooling system here is the they each
exchanger<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.370> call<00:00:59.750> normally<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> used

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
exchanger that we call normally it used

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
exchanger that we call normally it used
to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> big<00:01:01.620> round<00:01:01.920> cylinder<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
to be a big round cylinder now it is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.480 
to be a big round cylinder now it is
more<00:01:03.690> compact<00:01:04.880> also<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.600> introduced<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.290> new

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
more compact also we introduced a new

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
more compact also we introduced a new
bracket<00:01:08.490> which<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> one-piece<00:01:09.720> bracket

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
bracket which is a one-piece bracket

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.330 
bracket which is a one-piece bracket
that<00:01:11.340> holds<00:01:11.420> every<00:01:12.420> every<00:01:13.380> components<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that holds every every components of the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.690 
that holds every every components of the
engine<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.600> 2015<00:01:15.960> we're<00:01:16.920> offering<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> new

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
engine so for 2015 we're offering a new

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600 
engine so for 2015 we're offering a new
technology<00:01:18.600> we're<00:01:18.810> offering<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> DI<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.369> call

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
technology we're offering the DI we call

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
technology we're offering the DI we call
it<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.000> called<00:01:21.390> direct<00:01:21.720> injection

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it it's called direct injection

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
it it's called direct injection
basically<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> injectors<00:01:24.090> directly<00:01:24.600> into

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
basically the injectors directly into

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
basically the injectors directly into
the<00:01:25.110> combustion<00:01:25.409> chamber<00:01:25.640> compared<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the combustion chamber compared to the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
the combustion chamber compared to the
MPI<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> multi<00:01:27.869> port<00:01:28.049> injection<00:01:28.710> where<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
MPI the multi port injection where the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.120 
MPI the multi port injection where the
injectors<00:01:29.549> were<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> cylinder<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
injectors were into the cylinder it that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
injectors were into the cylinder it that
was<00:01:32.310> level<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> help<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> fuel<00:01:33.659> economy<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
was level to help for a fuel economy the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
was level to help for a fuel economy the
running<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> engines<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.790> precise<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
running of the engines more precise and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.319 
running of the engines more precise and
more<00:01:37.710> smooth<00:01:38.070> compared<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.820> our<00:01:39.119> previous

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
more smooth compared to our previous

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.940 
more smooth compared to our previous
version

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
version

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.730 
version
also<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> engines<00:01:42.270> offered<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.810> catalysts

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
also this engines offered with catalysts

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.120 
also this engines offered with catalysts
for<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.820> year<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.409> closed<00:01:46.650> cooling

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
for this year we have the closed cooling

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
for this year we have the closed cooling
because<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.610> engine<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:47.940> completely<00:01:48.240> full

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
because the engine is completely full

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
because the engine is completely full
aluminum<00:01:49.260> block<00:01:50.330> -<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:52.080> having<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.500> full

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
aluminum block - so by having a full

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
aluminum block - so by having a full
unblock<00:01:53.280> we're<00:01:53.610> looking<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:53.940> lightweight<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
unblock we're looking at lightweight the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
unblock we're looking at lightweight the
whole<00:01:55.409> package<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> drive<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.910> the

whole package with the drive and the
props<00:01:57.420> included<00:01:57.930> we're<00:01:58.080> looking<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.440> 850

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
props included we're looking at 850

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.430 
props included we're looking at 850
pounds<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.509> about<00:02:00.690> 150<00:02:01.259> pounds

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
pounds so which is about 150 pounds
