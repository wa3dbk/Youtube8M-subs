00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.930 
paying a really high cable bill and like
I<00:02:42.720> said<00:02:42.780> all<00:02:43.079> these<00:02:43.230> add-ons<00:02:43.650> are<00:02:43.860> loaded<00:02:44.790> onto

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
I said all these add-ons are loaded onto

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.920 
I said all these add-ons are loaded onto
your<00:02:45.269> box<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.760> manufacturers<00:02:48.450> don't<00:02:48.720> load

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
your box the manufacturers don't load

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.640 
your box the manufacturers don't load
the<00:02:49.109> boxes<00:02:49.319> with<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:49.799> these<00:02:49.950> add-ons<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:51.209> do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the boxes with all these add-ons we do

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.250 
the boxes with all these add-ons we do
we<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.799> provide<00:02:53.280> over<00:02:53.750> 950<00:02:54.750> add-ons

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
we actually provide over 950 add-ons

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.949 
we actually provide over 950 add-ons
which<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.310> lot<00:02:56.849> more<00:02:56.879> than<00:02:57.269> what<00:02:57.420> people<00:02:57.450> do

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
which is a lot more than what people do

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.890 
which is a lot more than what people do
online<00:02:58.519> if<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.849> similar<00:03:00.329> setups<00:03:00.810> for

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
online if you see similar setups for

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.680 
online if you see similar setups for
these<00:03:01.200> boxes<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.700> know<00:03:02.819> there<00:03:03.420> are<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.540> lot

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
these boxes you know there are a lot

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.150 
these boxes you know there are a lot
more<00:03:03.720> expensive<00:03:04.109> than<00:03:04.470> what<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.799> sell<00:03:05.040> them

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
more expensive than what we sell them

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.680 
more expensive than what we sell them
for<00:03:06.530> so<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.910> idea<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.359> you're<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.629> to
