in a live environment so I guess the the
main<00:00:46.480> difference<00:00:46.840> between<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.500> last<00:00:47.680> one<00:00:47.860> and

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980

the way it all kind of came about and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
Jack to use this we kind of felt like we

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.099 
Jack to use this we kind of felt like we
were<00:02:43.829> getting<00:02:44.549> away<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:44.909> robbery<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> little

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
were getting away with robbery a little

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.809 
were getting away with robbery a little
bit<00:02:46.260> because<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.799> was<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.669> kind<00:02:47.730> of

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
bit because it was it was it kind of

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.240 
bit because it was it was it kind of
like<00:02:48.409> you<00:02:49.409> know<00:02:49.500> could<00:02:49.709> run<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:49.889> trouble<00:02:50.219> I

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
like you know could run a trouble I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.530 
like you know could run a trouble I
guess<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.579> a<00:02:50.849> sense<00:02:50.879> because<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.299> was<00:02:51.389> like<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
guess in a sense because it was like a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.679 
guess in a sense because it was like a
bootleg<00:02:51.930> remix<00:02:52.049> but<00:02:52.439> yeah<00:02:52.560> after<00:02:52.889> that<00:02:53.689> think

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
bootleg remix but yeah after that think

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.319 
bootleg remix but yeah after that think
that<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.169> song<00:02:55.439> in<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.680> way<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:56.069> just<00:02:56.329> felt

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
that that song in a way we just felt

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.179 
that that song in a way we just felt
like<00:02:57.449> we<00:02:57.689> did<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.049> wasn't<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.379> some<00:02:58.859> remixes

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
like we did it wasn't like some remixes

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.949 
like we did it wasn't like some remixes
we<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> full<00:02:59.790> transformation<00:03:00.209> remix<00:03:00.810> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
we do a full transformation remix is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.110 
we do a full transformation remix is
like<00:03:01.109> when<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.290> remix<00:03:01.650> -<00:03:01.859> Punk<00:03:02.159> we<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.459> just

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
like when we remix - Punk we really just

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.939 
like when we remix - Punk we really just
took<00:03:03.239> one<00:03:03.540> piece<00:03:03.689> of<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.959> song<00:03:04.169> and<00:03:04.379> then

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
took one piece of the song and then

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.349 
took one piece of the song and then
built<00:03:05.219> a<00:03:05.310> whole<00:03:05.430> new<00:03:05.459> song<00:03:05.790> around<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.269> even

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
built a whole new song around it or even

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.449 
built a whole new song around it or even
the<00:03:06.510> same<00:03:06.659> thing<00:03:06.930> with<00:03:07.139> our<00:03:07.379> TV<00:03:07.919> on<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.189> radio
