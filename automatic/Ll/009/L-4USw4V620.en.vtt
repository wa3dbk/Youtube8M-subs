Warriors<00:05:06.560> with<00:05:06.800> one<00:05:06.980> piece<00:05:07.220> characters<00:05:07.730> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
Warriors with one piece characters the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.610 
Warriors with one piece characters the
one<00:05:08.150> piece<00:05:08.360> story<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.750> huge<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.260> this<00:05:09.380> game

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
one piece story is huge and this game

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.080 
one piece story is huge and this game
seems<00:05:09.920> to<00:05:10.010> take<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.400> through<00:05:10.430> most<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.030> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
seems to take you through most of the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.120 
seems to take you through most of the
arts<00:05:11.480> released<00:05:11.870> so<00:05:12.170> far<00:05:12.200> which<00:05:12.650> theoretically

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
arts released so far which theoretically

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.400 
arts released so far which theoretically
means<00:05:13.700> tons<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.600> hours<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.110> different

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
means tons of hours and different

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.320 
means tons of hours and different
missions<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.010> boss<00:05:16.400> fights<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.970> think<00:05:17.240> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
missions and boss fights I think the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.850 
missions and boss fights I think the
trick<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.810> keep<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.170> fresh<00:05:18.410> keep<00:05:18.620> us

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
trick is to keep it fresh keep us

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.320 
trick is to keep it fresh keep us
motivated<00:05:19.040> with<00:05:19.610> different<00:05:19.880> boss<00:05:20.030> fights

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330

interesting<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.700> will<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:26.150> but<00:05:26.420> we'll

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
interesting it will be but we'll

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.540 
interesting it will be but we'll
definitely<00:05:26.960> have<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.290> look<00:05:27.530> at<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.710> until<00:05:28.130> dawn

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
seems that the story changes

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.500 
seems that the story changes
significantly<00:05:39.980> which<00:05:40.970> would<00:05:41.180> encourage

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
significantly which would encourage
