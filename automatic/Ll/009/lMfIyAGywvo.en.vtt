PowerPoint<00:02:47.830> we'll<00:02:47.950> think<00:02:48.070> about<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.430> a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
PowerPoint we'll think about it for a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.980 
PowerPoint we'll think about it for a
minute<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.360> your<00:02:49.540> pictures<00:02:49.840> are

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
minute and now your pictures are

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.770 
minute and now your pictures are
compressed<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.820> next<00:02:52.150> let's<00:02:52.480> look<00:02:52.630> at

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
compressed so next let's look at

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.390 
compressed so next let's look at
compressing<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.410> video<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.890> audio<00:02:54.010> files

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
compressing your video and audio files

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
compressing your video and audio files
this<00:02:55.060> will<00:02:55.240> delete<00:02:55.510> extraneous<00:02:56.080> image<00:02:56.380> in

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
this will delete extraneous image in

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.590 
this will delete extraneous image in
sound<00:02:56.770> data<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.250> remove<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.090> beginning<00:02:58.360> or

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
sound data and remove the beginning or

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.300 
sound data and remove the beginning or
endings<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.140> media<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.470> you've<00:02:59.830> cropped<00:03:00.040> and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
endings of media that you've cropped and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.980 
endings of media that you've cropped and
trimmed<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:01.150> does<00:03:01.390> result<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.840> lower

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
trimmed this does result in lower

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.110 
trimmed this does result in lower
quality<00:03:02.500> images<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.070> videos<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.730> only

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
quality images and videos so only

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.760 
quality images and videos so only
perform<00:03:04.480> these<00:03:04.600> steps<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.990> your<00:03:05.110> file<00:03:05.290> really

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
perform these steps if your file really

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.280 
perform these steps if your file really
is<00:03:05.890> too<00:03:06.130> large<00:03:06.310> first<00:03:07.150> let's<00:03:07.600> save<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> copy<00:03:08.110> of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
is too large first let's save a copy of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.930 
is too large first let's save a copy of
our<00:03:08.410> presentation<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.490> we<00:03:09.550> can<00:03:09.640> always

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
our presentation so that we can always

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.300 
our presentation so that we can always
go<00:03:10.090> back<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> original<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.980> will<00:03:12.160> give

go back to the original this will give

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.010 
go back to the original this will give
us<00:03:12.430> two<00:03:12.640> copies<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.210> file<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.690> high

us two copies of a file a high

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.870 
us two copies of a file a high

great science writer at that point I can
see<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.880> image<00:05:25.090> is<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> little<00:05:25.570> bit

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
see that the image is a little bit

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360
