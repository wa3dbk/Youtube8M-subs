00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.730
 how about communist I do not expect it to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.860
 find this video very good 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.660
 ok brief but I want to show you a 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.640
 palette that came to me yesterday afternoon 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.619
 and I'm pretty happy with this 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.410
 palette is from team art 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.570
 I do not know if those who watched the video 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.369
 previous shopping I mentioned that they 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.830
 I showed that I had bought some things 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.010
 for trimmer nails good in this 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.290
 occasion I got a palette of 88 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.970
 colors in neutral tones 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.160
 I wanted this palette since I saw it 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.590
 from the first time and now I count on 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.570
 the joy of having it in my hands and that 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 is what I want to show you if you 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.829
 that you also are 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.020
 interested in acquiring a palette that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.699
 have first a good price and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.890
 that has a quality well enough 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.890
 good to be able to experience and 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.230
 practice with different looks really 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.449
 here you can get very good looks to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.489
 Although it is a palette that has 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.440
 pretty neutral tones 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.509
 also it has this that is here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.850
 I thought it was very nice that it's a tour 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.190
 that is like cake and I think that for 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.720
 this coming season I have seen many 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.940
 things in shoes 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.310
 Size in accessories with this color 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.040
 turquoise and they are mixing with 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.810
 neutral tones and I think that to this palette 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.500
 you can get a very good match 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.690
 especially for me because I then 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.190
 daily cap with neutral tones 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.900
 They like very much the make-up that look 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.500
 natural the shades the tones that are 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.660
 so matt tones so this is 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.240
 It can also be used to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.670
 create looks and smoked because it has 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.250
 has these gray shades tones 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 coffees and all darker shades that are 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.450
 can use to get good looks 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.910
 smoked this shadow from up here are 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 very good to light up I put on makeup 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.530
 my eyes this morning I already have like more 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.680
 of 9 hours already tonight I have more than 9 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.740
 hours with the shades on and then 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.030
 I can say that I'm pretty 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.340
 pleased with the result we have 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.590
 quartered that they keep well me 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.940
 I feel pretty good with them and for 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.070
 example I'm going to give you a test this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.890
 was the one for you to highlight the bone 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.760
 of the eyebrow and as you can see I do not know if 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.069
 here it is appreciated 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.780
 but pigment pigmentation is 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.459
 pretty good estimate this delivery to 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.400
 Everywhere in the world has clients 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.549
 around the whole world and not with the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.650
 shipping thing that is very attractive the idea 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.470
 at the time of placing an order because no 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.840
 It covers shipping and then I'll leave the links 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.540
 down in the information box both of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.150
 this palette like the other palette of the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 ranges of strong colors so that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.840
 you see it and you can do my 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.900
 recommendation my short video of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.359
 recommendation for today I hope 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.519
 that you liked the packaging as you see 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:02.299
 the case is quite light, very easy 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.599
 to carry and transport and very thin 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.450
 it does not weigh good anyway i'm going to leave you with 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.579
 some clues at the end and good in itself 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.650
 know I would like to be told that 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.470
 they think of them if they have already seen it and 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.900
 I'm also thinking of including the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.970
 get it for a draw soon 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.760
 that I'm going to have already very soon so I 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.739
 they say how they think 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.640
 of having it by the draw also up 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.640
 that is very well 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.750
 i 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.719
 and 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.260
 this 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.469
