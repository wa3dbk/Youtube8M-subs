that's<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.180> Rockstar<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.890> could<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that's how Rockstar is or it could be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's how Rockstar is or it could be
something<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.869> GTA<00:01:52.649> 5

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
something that we're gonna see in GTA 5

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
something that we're gonna see in GTA 5
let's<00:01:53.310> say<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> single-player<00:01:54.180> expansion<00:01:55.100> DLC

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
let's say a single-player expansion DLC

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
let's say a single-player expansion DLC
and<00:01:56.360> extension<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.930> Mount<00:01:58.170> chiliad

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and extension of the Mount chiliad

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
and extension of the Mount chiliad
mystery<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.520> very<00:01:59.759> cool<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.750> do

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
mystery that would be very cool and I do

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.120 
mystery that would be very cool and I do
think<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.320> we're<00:02:01.469> gonna<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.829> something

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
think that we're gonna see something

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
think that we're gonna see something
like<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.430> within<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.659> GTA<00:02:04.320> 5

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like that within this GTA 5

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.730 
like that within this GTA 5
single-player<00:02:05.310> update<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.149> moving<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.140> there

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
single-player update now moving on there

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.339 
single-player update now moving on there
is<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.489> brand<00:02:09.030> new<00:02:09.179> landmass<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.110> could

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
is also a brand new landmass that could

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.300 
is also a brand new landmass that could
be<00:02:10.500> added<00:02:10.890> into<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.459> game<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
be added into the game and

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.860 
be added into the game and
unfortunately<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.270> not<00:02:13.330> something<00:02:13.840> like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
unfortunately it's not something like

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.540 
unfortunately it's not something like
Vice<00:02:14.230> City<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.740> we'd<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> see<00:02:15.400> your

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
Vice City that we'd like to see your

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.510 
Vice City that we'd like to see your
Liberty<00:02:15.970> City<00:02:16.270> or<00:02:16.680> Las<00:02:17.680> Ventas<00:02:18.220> or<00:02:18.340> anything

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
Liberty City or Las Ventas or anything

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.910 
Liberty City or Las Ventas or anything
like<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.600> actually<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.080> new<00:02:20.319> city<00:02:20.650> added

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
like that it's actually a new city added

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.699 
like that it's actually a new city added
into<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> north<00:02:21.850> yankton<00:02:22.240> called<00:02:23.110> Clifford

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
into the north yankton called Clifford

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.470 
into the north yankton called Clifford
now<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.430> note<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> there's<00:02:24.940> ludendorff

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
now we note that there's ludendorff

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.880 
now we note that there's ludendorff
north<00:02:25.750> yankton<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.319> i<00:02:26.350> believe<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:26.800> how

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
north yankton and i believe that's how

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.890 
north yankton and i believe that's how
you<00:02:26.920> pronounce<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:28.120> there's<00:02:28.300> also<00:02:28.540> it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
you pronounce that but there's also it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.170 
you pronounce that but there's also it
could<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.230> Clifford<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.160> once<00:02:30.730> again<00:02:30.850> this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
could be Clifford and once again this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
could be Clifford and once again this
could<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.540> something<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:31.959> was<00:02:32.290> maybe

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
could be something that was maybe

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
could be something that was maybe
removed<00:02:33.010> from<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.370> game<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.180> think<00:02:34.480> we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
removed from the game but I think we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
removed from the game but I think we
would<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:34.989> known<00:02:35.140> about<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.620> earlier<00:02:36.010> on

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
would have known about this earlier on

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.490 
would have known about this earlier on
and<00:02:36.730> upon<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.660> research<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.260> don't

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
and upon for the research I don't

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500 
and upon for the research I don't
believe<00:02:38.709> there<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.040> any<00:02:39.250> location<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.180> GTA

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
believe there is any location in the GTA

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.050 
believe there is any location in the GTA
series<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:41.500> takes<00:02:41.739> place<00:02:42.130> in<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.610> location

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
series that takes place in a location

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.630 
series that takes place in a location
called<00:02:43.660> Clifford<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.890> that's<00:02:45.370> very

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
called Clifford so that's very

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.030 
called Clifford so that's very
interesting<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.510> I'm<00:02:46.720> very<00:02:46.959> excited<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.680> see

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
interesting and I'm very excited to see

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.660 
interesting and I'm very excited to see
what<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:49.060> Clifford<00:02:49.690> location<00:02:50.560> could<00:02:51.070> be<00:02:51.130> now

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
what this Clifford location could be now

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.370 
what this Clifford location could be now
we're<00:02:52.150> gonna<00:02:52.239> see<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> wide<00:02:52.810> variety<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.290> things

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
we're gonna see a wide variety of things

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
we're gonna see a wide variety of things
such<00:02:53.890> as<00:02:53.920> assassination<00:02:54.850> missions<00:02:55.209> added<00:02:55.630> in

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
such as assassination missions added in

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.380 
such as assassination missions added in
strangers<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.830> freaks<00:02:57.130> different<00:02:58.090> mission

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
strangers and freaks different mission

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.509 
strangers and freaks different mission
triggers<00:02:58.750> also<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> believe<00:02:59.350> there's<00:02:59.739> like<00:02:59.860> 34

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
triggers also I believe there's like 34

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.610 
triggers also I believe there's like 34
more<00:03:00.850> than<00:03:01.000> 34<00:03:01.569> mission<00:03:01.930> triggers<00:03:02.290> found

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
more than 34 mission triggers found

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.309 
more than 34 mission triggers found
within<00:03:03.310> these<00:03:03.430> game<00:03:03.670> files<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.300> reference<00:03:05.230> to

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
within these game files in reference to

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.100 
within these game files in reference to
single<00:03:06.190> player<00:03:06.400> DLC<00:03:06.700> missions<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:07.900> that's

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
single player DLC missions so that's

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.860 
single player DLC missions so that's
very<00:03:08.410> cool<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.920> also<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:10.030> want<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.540> talk<00:03:10.690> about

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
very cool and also I want to talk about

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.870 
very cool and also I want to talk about
there's<00:03:11.260> new<00:03:11.590> things<00:03:11.920> being<00:03:12.130> included<00:03:12.610> in<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
there's new things being included in the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.880 
there's new things being included in the
game<00:03:13.120> such<00:03:13.450> as<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.600> cell<00:03:14.019> phone<00:03:14.260> controller

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
game such as a cell phone controller

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.550 
game such as a cell phone controller
script<00:03:15.700> as<00:03:15.910> well<00:03:16.420> as<00:03:16.540> dialog<00:03:17.079> handler

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
script as well as dialog handler

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.770 
script as well as dialog handler
building<00:03:18.400> controller<00:03:18.850> which<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.450> sounds

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
building controller which that sounds

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.090 
building controller which that sounds
very<00:03:19.900> interesting<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.829> mentioned

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
very interesting and like I mentioned

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370 
very interesting and like I mentioned
before<00:03:21.130> I'm<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.690> genius<00:03:23.170> when<00:03:23.320> it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
before I'm not really a genius when it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.870 
before I'm not really a genius when it
comes<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.040> coding<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.430> different<00:03:24.730> things

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
comes to the coding and different things

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.030 
comes to the coding and different things
like<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.540> maybe<00:03:25.750> building<00:03:26.650> controller

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
like that but maybe building controller

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.069 
like that but maybe building controller
could<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.400> things<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.660> controlling

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
could be things like just controlling

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.750 
could be things like just controlling
different<00:03:29.620> things<00:03:29.829> within<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.190> interiors

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
different things within the interiors

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360 
different things within the interiors
that<00:03:30.820> would<00:03:31.090> be<00:03:31.180> awesome<00:03:31.360> having<00:03:32.370> elevators

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
that would be awesome having elevators

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.160 
that would be awesome having elevators
that<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.880> interact<00:03:34.120> with<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.810> take<00:03:34.989> up

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
that you can interact with and take up
