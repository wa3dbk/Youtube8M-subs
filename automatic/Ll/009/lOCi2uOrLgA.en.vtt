00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello, I 'm felipe sky, use this video to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.400
 give a tip on reading music 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.679
 sheet music so that you can start studying 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.070
 piano and what to learn to read sheet music 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 this is a very valuable tip already for now 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
 to let go of everything there to him 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.000
 Did you watch a mini piano course was 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 available on the internet, you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 realized that it is given to there was the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.260
 learning was by limitation I 'm with 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 one piece the student is giving me the beautiful 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.690
 solidary gesture even touching the notes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.030
 eye on the way of touching the dynamics 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 music that is being applied there and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 copying this incorporating a bit this 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 but already a next step and a lot 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.899
 important no doubt because yes 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.320
 learning people will evolve a lot and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 music is to learn to read music to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 reading on the piano is as follows 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
 you have a piano sheet music 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.719
 You will look at you will see five lines. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 for the right hand and then five lines 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 for the left hand 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 You do not need to understand the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.229
 what's that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.820
 I have no problem talking more 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.130
 double what he 's talking about and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 sync I speak with the lines not 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.760
 No problem at all, this is important. 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.290
 these lines 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.400
 they are referring to note names 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.170
 at heights to which key on the final piano 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.750
 of the accounts you're going to touch 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
 and the important thing to notice in this 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.030
 It's time for you to memorize 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 position on the lines and between 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.439
 the lines and so already gain a lot of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 time in the study 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.180
 so come the order to hand rights 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 here to memorize without much question 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110
 at that moment because then you will make a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.689
 great sense in the course of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 Learning is the five lines of the hand 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.220
 right first order will be down 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:56.729
 Up, my sunshine is gone, this time. 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.689
 order as if it were a missal word 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.290
 if you remember, think about it after you look 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.489
 do in small sayings first line 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.649
 me third line if the fifth line fa 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.060
 according to the line sun starts to change 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.950
 reverse and you will realize 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.340
 when what is already automated when 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.989
 no and there the spaces to order are four 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.569
 spaces between the five lines 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.180
 then Domi also thinks as if 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.400
 if it was a word, say Sunday and then you 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.280
 makes this saying to himself 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.489
 reversing think of it the same 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.739
 arriving when thinking about a space second 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.330
 space there has to be automated 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.730
 first space fa 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.340
 Then you do the same thing to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.540
 left has a note name 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.880
 many different 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.049
 is the following from bottom to top five 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.489
 left hand lines 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:54.430
 only remade the same thing it saves 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.370
 this will reverse the thinking now I will 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.349
 now is the first line now third 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.599
 line is now the second line again 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.810
 now fifth is changing to see if the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:08.049
 sun is reborn there is embedded and you 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 can associate something else with thinking 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.540
 independently in each of the lines 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.950
 and then respond quickly to the spaces 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.620
 spaces on the left 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.170
 there to sleep, the sun also thinks as if it were 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.120
 a word and then you dictate the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.540
 sleep only the first line first 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.160
 space there four spaces second sun 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.250
 space of the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.569
 Are you going to play? Check if you are well. 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.170
 incorporated 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.290
 it is very common for the piano student to stay 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 debating there with the opposition of the notes 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.609
 in the score at the beginning mainly 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.290
 people who are starting to study a 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.690
 little later that has little time 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.819
 to decorate things to devote to 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.620
 an absurdity so intense ends up being 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.030
 overdue for not being able to 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.060
 memorize notes 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.579
 Alina is missing when it would take you there 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.840
 two days there 12 days at most thinking 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.090
 about this with a certain regularity if 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.980
 easily memorize something like this. 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.819
 It's no big deal, you think they're like 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.760
 It was four words to me, rafaela 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:16.539
 Sunday after only talking to me, my sunshine. 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.299
 Just memorizations will save you a lot 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.239
 and will make it much easier for 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.340
 president 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.979
 new year repertoire and so it is 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.310
 always renewing his musical style 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.620
 It's good if you're not watching yet. 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.630
 received this mini piano course 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.240

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.000
