00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
two screws in the back so you could

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770 
two screws in the back so you could
adjust<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.850> screw<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.630> are

realistic<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.350> screw<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.549> be

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
realistic here screw so it will not be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.890 
realistic here screw so it will not be
falling<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:39.210> anytime<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> back

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
oh this is like reckoning the location

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.570 
oh this is like reckoning the location
in<00:01:53.290> case<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.620> lose<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.070> something<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:54.490> that
