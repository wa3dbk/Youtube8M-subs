00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.780
 What a miserable man, that I have become 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:49.660
 I beg the bread that was left yesterday and was mine. 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:01:01.940
 In disappointment, hope is born 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:20.420
 And I live the present, regardless of what happened 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:29.880
 For if everything has changed, in Christ I am more than I am 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:45.420
 Behind me I leave the man I was, and the houses I built away from You 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:59.960
 If everything has changed, I open the sails of the boat, hoping that in the morning 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 I'll see the harbor where I'll meet you at the harbor where I'll meet you. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.480
 The port where I will meet you 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.880
 As a refugee, leaving your country. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:45.860
 Running away at night, unable to sleep 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:57.580
 Trusting in the promise, that mourning takes the night 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 The day soon comes, and cries of joy echoed 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:27.000
 If everything has changed, in Christ I am more than I am 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:42.820
 Behind me I leave the man I was, and the houses I built away from You 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:58.120
 If everything has changed, I open the sails of the boat, hoping that in the morning 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:14.860
 I'll see the harbor where I'll meet you at the harbor where I'll meet you. 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:27.460
 If the rain hits me and the boat rolls 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:40.000
 That I end up on solid ground there 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.100
 If everything has changed, in Christ I am more than I am. 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:05:08.580
 Behind me I leave the man I was, and the houses I built away from You. 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:23.180
 If everything has changed, I open the sails of the boat, hoping that in the morning 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:32.480
 I will see the harbor where I will meet you, the harbor where I will meet you. 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.420
 The port where I will meet you
