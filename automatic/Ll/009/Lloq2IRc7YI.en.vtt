00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.560

 but unfortunately competitors in front of him 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.280
 fall and they end up twice 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.740
 in a pilots package ashore in 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.210

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.040
 such a competition every second to his 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.310

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.870
 tower 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.580
 but it takes a lot of effort 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.969
 that he will pay at the end of the race by having 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.699
