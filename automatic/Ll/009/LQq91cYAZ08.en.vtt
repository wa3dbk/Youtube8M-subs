 Well, speaking of that numark 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:25.220
 It's Kagari, and there is a spirit of challenge. 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:31.790
 Kana said that revolutionary Let You however say that issues the product country Nante famous and that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 to say that has created the future of the dj is so I do not an exaggeration various one 8 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.560

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.580
 Of course become a tooth even Toka anyone other than dg is one of the products 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:46.140
 I got a tan table called tte vsb 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.130
 It is the model that we put usb on the turntable for the first time in the world 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.570
 Recently, there are many record players with usb, but I don't care 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.160
 It is a feeling that the mark is the world's first to do at first glance 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.420
 It is said to eat ball and whether to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.420
 It was a feeling that it was not possible to catch up with public service orders that caught and eat a big break Yes 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.170
 So it was about the same time 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.220
 8 idj series ibj 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:17.409
 It was the time when there was no apple's ipod or iphone yet 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:26.759

 l Apple 's migrating music The generation of especially large young children is 8 cd 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.110
 The age of carrying around knowing me is over and ipod is with your portable eye-fi 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.440
 Is that the future ? 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.620
 With the sometimes quickly eyes there was the era Tteyuu 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.020
 I want this 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.010
 It seems that the latest mark will also do things like putting out 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 The advent of the adventurous heart shape of the turntable 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:59.140
 Yes also see how this have Te dx there was a cd worth of while seems detective minute 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.470
 Even if you have a fan who uses the sentence you did for 0 bones that you like 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.050
 Even if you come here 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.170
 That's a good head, maybe it's ze ne I'm pretty good at operability 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 It's said that support cdx 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.370
 Pretty amazing complete about catch snow-mail, such as sell a little bit Once you have this relapse 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.380
 The degree is right 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.600
 There was something really various 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.600
 I wonder if it is ok 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 After all 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.710
 It seems that the spirit of wanting to challenge more and more becomes corporate culture already 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.319
 Well there is this one 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:08.250
 There is also something that is too new or good, but that kind of thing 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.250
 Speaking during this time 8 year before last several times Do not announce it today yer me that orbit 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.280
 I would like to anticipate the boo-boo radio 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 It's a good guy, but that's right everyone loves it a lot 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:42.420
 It was once with Ghan, but I feel like that psp feels like a good game 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.900
 It looks like you can have good control in battle 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.860
 It seems to be able to move with serato dj wirelessly 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.520
 Say Well details, and who reward the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.940
 The prefectural prisoner in the tube is not really a game 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.690
 I'm wondering Fu that a Numazu and 6 points 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:04.860
 It's innovative and it feels like I'm meeting in recent years 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.640
 It feels like a worldwide group of six acts 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:13.770
 I M-Audio Toka that is Toka red 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.209
 Door Well has become a kind of eminent music group of companies 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.239
 It says that more and more there is now momentum 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.460
 Well, so once in total now 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:28.870
 It is that company that Otoyoshi America is already the head office, but says commission music 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.840
 There l was this numark company is the headquarters there is a sea such that the original source 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.650
 Or Toka Toka Akai had you saying earlier Yosuke 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.200
 mo Is it about 13 brands in all? 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.380

 or in music is having round girl Oh 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.270
 It is a situation where you say that everything is stealing a new product well . 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:05:00.540
 noon Well such Nyo-chan range spirit also Moreover longer live 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:04.490
 Say Hey Kinme the mix track pro is 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.490
 Really 30 there is there is a controller 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 Hmm 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.540
 Here 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.080
 It is over ob's attack yes 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.500
 Abekiha acme 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.430
 Arthur does not charge . 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 Yeah xs transformation can likely Kana is struck this 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:32.800
 Ya is a wireless 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.879
 In even the Tteyuu this mix track pro-2 is not a big hit that well 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.720
 I think that the mix before that is a pro or something 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:44.949
 Maybe anymore you say are best-selling in the world 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.470
 There is the Tteyuu really luck because there is no or not it exaggeration 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:54.470
 Toka it or there is also something of technology pad something even red in you 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.050
 By the way, this is that very cheap 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.389
 Many times 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.280
 Well it seems that this mix track pull is also so so good 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.830
 Though it is model called pain 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:13.300
 Of course there is also a case in which there is a case where there is a way of getting introductory, but it is also quite complete degree 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.040
 Or Dattari high of in quite from Intermediate towards the senior second machine 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.409
 That child has got a pretty wide audience 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.999
 Net high 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:25.989
 Well now that's why numark users are all over the world 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:30.729
 It's really all right, it's safe and it's right when you go there 

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:36.790
 It's only natural to say it's grateful if you have a large number of users 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:39.940
 It is a place where know-how accumulation is nothing but half 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.540
 Well always always kinda upset 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:47.010
