a release residue you'll always need to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.980 
a release residue you'll always need to
remove<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.890> residue<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> some<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.869> of

remove that residue with a some kind of
degreaser<00:01:07.830> before<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> next

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
material onto that part now you'll

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
material onto that part now you'll
notice<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.619> part<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> green

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
notice our part is a little bit green

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
notice our part is a little bit green
it's<00:01:15.659> still<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.500> give<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's still got some give to it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
it's still got some give to it
this<00:01:17.580> particular<00:01:18.090> resin<00:01:18.420> takes<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.720> 24

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this particular resin takes about 24

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
this particular resin takes about 24
hours<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.590> cure<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.729> tough<00:01:21.090> hard

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
hours to cure to a really tough hard

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.070 
hours to cure to a really tough hard
plastic<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:23.610> here's<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> copper<00:01:24.540> metal<00:01:24.720> rub

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
plastic now here's the copper metal rub

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.670 
plastic now here's the copper metal rub
and<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.970> wax<00:01:27.540> finishing<00:01:28.229> material

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
and this is a a wax finishing material

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
and this is a a wax finishing material
that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.729> dry<00:01:30.150> brush<00:01:30.509> over<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> surface

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that we just dry brush over the surface

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
that we just dry brush over the surface
and<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.619> gonna<00:01:31.710> grab<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and we're gonna grab a little bit of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300 
and we're gonna grab a little bit of
that<00:01:33.119> metal<00:01:33.479> rub<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.200> brush<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.920> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that metal rub on a brush and it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
that metal rub on a brush and it's
always<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.790> idea<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.180> test<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> clean

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
always a good idea to test it on a clean

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
always a good idea to test it on a clean
surface<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.189> how<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:38.909> on

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
surface just to see how much you have on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.730 
surface just to see how much you have on
the<00:01:39.270> brush<00:01:39.509> before<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.350> use<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.680> your

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the brush before you use it on your

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
the brush before you use it on your
piece<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> make<00:01:41.820> sure<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.270> over

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
piece just to make sure you don't over

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
piece just to make sure you don't over
apply<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> material<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.729> particular

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
apply the material with this particular

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
apply the material with this particular
technique<00:01:45.600> less<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> want<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
technique less is more so we want to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
technique less is more so we want to
just<00:01:47.100> carefully<00:01:47.790> dry<00:01:48.060> brush<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> top

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
just carefully dry brush it over the top

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
just carefully dry brush it over the top
just<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.220> bring<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> highs<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:50.939> lows<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just to bring out the highs and lows of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.440 
just to bring out the highs and lows of
the<00:01:51.780> piece<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:53.130> black<00:01:53.460> resin<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.240> gives

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the piece and the black resin just gives
