00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is the sound I'm looking for.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And this is my sauce.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I lower the heat, cover it, and let it cook for 8 more minutes

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it's ready to serve.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hello, dear friends. Welcome to Sabores (Flavors) with Denisse.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
On our menu today: pisco sour.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That refreshing and frothy typical cocktail of Latin America.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The secret is the pisco.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A liquor made from grapes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Peru and Chile both claim to be its creator.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We won't get into that discussion

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because we're all friends and we just want to enjoy a delicious pisco sour.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
My recipe calls for 2 ounces of mango,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a flavor that blends perfectly with the other ingredients.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
First, besides my pisco, there's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
lime juice.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This juice comes from Persian limes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which are smaller and more acidic than regular limes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you can't find them, you can use regular limes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There's egg whilte, essental for frothing,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
mango, in this case 2 ounces

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and syrup

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which I made with 4 ounces, or a half cup, of sugar

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and 3 tablespoons of water.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I let this melt and I end up with a syrup that gives a smooth touch

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to my drink.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Those are the ingredients.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then, I have ice

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and drops of bitters. Let's start!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I pour my pisco

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
lime juice

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
mango

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and syrup.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's like a sugar concentrate.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Once I pour all that in, I blend it well.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
A first blend.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then I add ice.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I cover it.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Once I have a smooth and cold puree

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
then, and only then

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
do I add the egg white

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to make the froth.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Here's my egg white.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And here's my pisco sour.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
With a lot of froth.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Cool, refreshing.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I serve it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and finish it with a drop of bitters.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's the classic way to serve it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
There we are.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Cheers!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Pisco sour with a taste of mango.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You'll love it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
