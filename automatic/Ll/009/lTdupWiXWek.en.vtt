00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
version I could find but I'm definitely

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380 
version I could find but I'm definitely
kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> taking<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> quality<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> book

kind of taking the quality of the book
into<00:02:03.689> account<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.380> usually<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.009> buy

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
into account more I usually just buy

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.300 
into account more I usually just buy
paper<00:02:05.340> bags<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.969> really

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
paper bags because I really

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.669 
paper bags because I really
like<00:02:06.460> carrying<00:02:07.000> them<00:02:07.149> around<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.289> doesn't

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
like carrying them around and it doesn't

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.380 
like carrying them around and it doesn't
matter<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:08.979> much<00:02:09.160> if<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.550> damage<00:02:09.759> them<00:02:10.060> but

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
matter that much if you damage them but

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.960 
matter that much if you damage them but
I<00:02:10.660> bought<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:11.319> beautiful<00:02:11.709> version<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.760> on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
I bought this beautiful version of on

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.150 
I bought this beautiful version of on
the<00:02:13.000> road<00:02:13.360> there<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.110> hand-drawn<00:02:14.650> map<00:02:14.950> of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
the road there is a hand-drawn map of

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.650 
the road there is a hand-drawn map of
the<00:02:15.280> United<00:02:15.640> States<00:02:15.910> in<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.150> front<00:02:16.420> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the United States in the front and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.330 
the United States in the front and
there's<00:02:16.959> another<00:02:17.349> kind<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.680> drawing<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
there's another kind of drawing on the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.339 
there's another kind of drawing on the
back<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.569> gorgeous<00:02:19.780> addition

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
back this is just a gorgeous addition

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.930 
back this is just a gorgeous addition
and<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.620> was<00:02:20.709> pretty<00:02:20.950> expensive<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.580> I'm

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
and it was pretty expensive but I'm

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.790 
and it was pretty expensive but I'm
hoping<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.599> worth<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> final

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
hoping that it's worth it and the final

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
hoping that it's worth it and the final
one<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.550> common<00:02:24.940> reader<00:02:25.209> by<00:02:25.630> Virginia

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
one is the common reader by Virginia

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.400 
one is the common reader by Virginia
Woolf<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.400> beautiful<00:02:27.760> blue<00:02:28.540> penguin
