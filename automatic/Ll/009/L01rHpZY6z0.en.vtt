this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.720> huge<00:01:49.079> range<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.009> reason<00:01:50.310> why

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
this is a huge range and the reason why

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
this is a huge range and the reason why
it's<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> CPM<00:01:52.380> if

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it's like this is because of a CPM if

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's like this is because of a CPM if
you<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.310> know<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.549> CPM<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.060> GBM<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you don't know what CPM is GBM is the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.569 
you don't know what CPM is GBM is the
amount<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> money<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.310> every<00:01:56.430> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
YouTube social it does is that they get

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
YouTube social it does is that they get
a<00:02:01.500> range<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.280> really<00:02:02.549> low<00:02:02.880> CPM<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> really

high CPM so if you're going to be asking

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.940

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
me what is the range

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
me what is the range
what<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.149> he<00:02:09.840> makes<00:02:10.080> from

what do I think that he makes from

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.410 
what do I think that he makes from

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
YouTube based on social blade I feel

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.479 
YouTube based on social blade I feel
like<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.810> he's<00:02:13.230> gonna<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:13.620> more<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.220> around

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
like that he's gonna be more to around

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.580 
like that he's gonna be more to around
that<00:02:14.640> six<00:02:14.970> point<00:02:15.209> five<00:02:15.420> thousand<00:02:16.080> dollars<00:02:16.319> per

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
that six point five thousand dollars per

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.650 
that six point five thousand dollars per
day<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.280> maybe<00:02:17.430> around<00:02:17.610> five<00:02:17.910> thousand<00:02:18.420> maybe

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
least 4,000 for sure and I guarantee but

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.430 
least 4,000 for sure and I guarantee but
now<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:24.150> into<00:02:24.269> my<00:02:24.420> calculations<00:02:25.260> on

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
now I'm going into my calculations on

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
now I'm going into my calculations on
how<00:02:25.920> much<00:02:26.040> money<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> feel<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.180> he

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
how much money do I feel like that he

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.470 
how much money do I feel like that he
has<00:02:27.390> made<00:02:27.599> from<00:02:28.349> total<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:28.950> youtube<00:02:29.489> alone<00:02:29.700> so

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
has made from total in youtube alone so

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.910 
has made from total in youtube alone so
he's<00:02:30.690> partnered<00:02:30.989> under<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.440> biggest<00:02:31.739> network

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
he's partnered under the biggest network

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.610 
he's partnered under the biggest network
right<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.250> which<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.580> machine<00:02:33.000> mana<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
right now which is machine mana and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.750 
right now which is machine mana and
since<00:02:34.620> machinima<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.610> biggest

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
since machinima is one of the biggest

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.820 
since machinima is one of the biggest
well-known<00:02:36.510> networks<00:02:36.930> around<00:02:37.349> there<00:02:37.650> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
well-known networks around there and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.800 
well-known networks around there and
it's<00:02:38.310> grown<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.730> he's<00:02:38.910> growing<00:02:39.299> every<00:02:39.540> single

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it's grown and he's growing every single

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.559 
it's grown and he's growing every single
day<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.230> feel<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.799> CPM<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.790> five<00:02:42.090> dollars

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
day I feel like I CPM is a five dollars

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.420 
day I feel like I CPM is a five dollars
so<00:02:43.019> five<00:02:43.260> dollars<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.739> every<00:02:43.769> thousand<00:02:44.400> years

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so five dollars for every thousand years

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.009 
so five dollars for every thousand years
that<00:02:44.670> he'd<00:02:44.790> get<00:02:44.940> wow<00:02:45.209> that's<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> lot<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> money

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
that he'd get wow that's a lot of money

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.470 
that he'd get wow that's a lot of money
so<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:46.799> let's<00:02:47.069> go<00:02:47.190> into<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> calculations<00:02:48.209> so

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so now let's go into the calculations so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.940 
so now let's go into the calculations so
let's<00:02:48.720> assume<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.140> he<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.380> partnered<00:02:49.709> under

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
let's assume that he was partnered under

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920 
let's assume that he was partnered under
machinima<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.910> his<00:02:51.030> whole<00:02:51.239> entire<00:02:51.360> career

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
machinima for his whole entire career

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.339 
machinima for his whole entire career
and<00:02:52.220> that's<00:02:53.220> five<00:02:53.489> CPM<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.750> which<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.110> nearly

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
and that's five CPM and which is nearly

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.949 
and that's five CPM and which is nearly
impossible<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:57.239> day<00:02:57.450> he

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
impossible but we don't know what day he

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.479 
impossible but we don't know what day he
was<00:02:58.049> partnered<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.709> I'm<00:02:59.130> gonna<00:02:59.310> be

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
was partnered so I'm gonna be

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.130 
was partnered so I'm gonna be
multiplying<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.329> total<00:03:00.690> amount<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.049> views

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
multiplying the total amount of views

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.470 
multiplying the total amount of views
which<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.680> 100<00:03:02.370> million<00:03:02.760> views<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.239> he<00:03:03.360> has

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
which is 100 million views that he has

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.319 
which is 100 million views that he has
gone<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.110> YouTube<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.590> total<00:03:05.040> by<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> CPM

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
gone in from YouTube in total by a CPM

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.839 
gone in from YouTube in total by a CPM
which<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.079> five<00:03:07.590> dollars<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.280> then<00:03:08.730> i'll

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
which is five dollars and then i'll

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.300 
which is five dollars and then i'll
divide<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.390> by<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> thousand<00:03:10.200> views<00:03:10.470> since<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
divide it by a thousand views since a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.069 
divide it by a thousand views since a
thousand<00:03:11.730> views<00:03:11.880> equals<00:03:12.299> five<00:03:12.450> dollars<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.019> I

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
thousand views equals five dollars and I

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.960 
thousand views equals five dollars and I

got 550 500 thousand dollars so that's a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.210 
got 550 500 thousand dollars so that's a
lot<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.299> money<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.319> guys<00:03:19.500> are<00:03:19.739> having

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
lot of money if you guys are having

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.039 
lot of money if you guys are having
trouble<00:03:20.549> following<00:03:20.880> my<00:03:21.420> voice<00:03:21.660> i'll<00:03:21.930> be

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
trouble following my voice i'll be

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.809 
trouble following my voice i'll be
leaving<00:03:22.470> annotations<00:03:23.130> above<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.670> can

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
leaving annotations above so you can

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.090 
leaving annotations above so you can
follow<00:03:24.030> them<00:03:24.269> along<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.440> now<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.709> my<00:03:25.829> mind

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
follow them along so but now in my mind

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.559 
follow them along so but now in my mind
i<00:03:26.220> feel<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.579> this<00:03:26.700> number<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.120> really<00:03:27.420> really

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
i feel like this number is really really

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.020 
i feel like this number is really really
and<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.440> reason<00:03:28.650> behind<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.430> because<00:03:29.819> i

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and the reason behind it is because i

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.879 
and the reason behind it is because i
feel<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.569> machinima<00:03:31.079> could<00:03:31.799> have

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
feel like the machinima could have

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.069 
feel like the machinima could have
possibly<00:03:32.069> offered<00:03:32.670> him<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.850> higher<00:03:33.389> CPM<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
possibly offered him a higher CPM and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.229 
possibly offered him a higher CPM and
most<00:03:34.230> likely<00:03:34.380> they<00:03:34.709> will<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:35.940> you're

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
most likely they will because if you're

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.629 
most likely they will because if you're
a<00:03:36.480> partner<00:03:36.959> under<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.650> name<00:03:38.010> they'll<00:03:38.459> give

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
a partner under the name they'll give

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.180 
a partner under the name they'll give
you<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.819> higher<00:03:39.090> CPM<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:40.440> machinima<00:03:40.920> they

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
you a higher CPM because machinima they

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.069 
you a higher CPM because machinima they
care<00:03:41.459> about<00:03:41.549> their<00:03:41.670> biggest<00:03:42.359> name<00:03:42.569> partners

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
care about their biggest name partners

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.710 
care about their biggest name partners
and<00:03:43.430> you're<00:03:44.430> gonna<00:03:44.639> give<00:03:44.850> them<00:03:44.970> normal

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
and you're gonna give them normal

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.390 
and you're gonna give them normal
because<00:03:46.080> they'll<00:03:46.320> give<00:03:46.470> more<00:03:46.740> income<00:03:47.190> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
because they'll give more income to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.670 
because they'll give more income to
their<00:03:47.520> company<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.570> I<00:03:48.960> feel<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
their company so I feel like the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920 
their company so I feel like the
Machinima<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.120> probably<00:03:51.360> possibly

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
Machinima that they probably possibly

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.950 
Machinima that they probably possibly
give<00:03:52.080> them<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.590> higher<00:03:52.950> CPM<00:03:53.190> such<00:03:53.610> as<00:03:53.820> six<00:03:54.330> seven

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
give them a higher CPM such as six seven

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.260 
give them a higher CPM such as six seven
or<00:03:55.050> eight<00:03:55.260> who<00:03:55.740> knows<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.310> reason<00:03:56.790> why<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.030> put

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
or eight who knows the reason why I put

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.000 
or eight who knows the reason why I put
five<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.960> just<00:03:58.230> wanted<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:58.770> safe

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
five is because I just wanted to be safe

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.850 
five is because I just wanted to be safe

from their actual youtube views and CBM

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.500 
from their actual youtube views and CBM
so<00:04:16.790> advertisement<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.910> don't<00:04:18.150> know<00:04:18.239> how<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
so advertisement I don't know how the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.770 
so advertisement I don't know how the
revenue<00:04:19.260> system<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:21.150> paying<00:04:21.450> system

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
revenue system and the paying system

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.090 
revenue system and the paying system
goes<00:04:21.959> through<00:04:22.170> advertisements<00:04:22.680> from

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
goes through advertisements from

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.100 
goes through advertisements from
machinima<00:04:23.490> because<00:04:24.240> I'm<00:04:24.360> my<00:04:24.480> partner<00:04:24.900> under

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
machinima because I'm my partner under

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
minimum partner under full screen so it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.570 
minimum partner under full screen so it
depends<00:04:28.260> on<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.530> as<00:04:28.710> well<00:04:28.860> but<00:04:29.130> most<00:04:29.370> likely

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
depends on that as well but most likely

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.700 
depends on that as well but most likely
you'll<00:04:30.300> be<00:04:30.420> having<00:04:30.600> more<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:30.990> more<00:04:31.140> money<00:04:31.470> and
