00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
resistance while saving a bit of waste

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.740 
resistance while saving a bit of waste
that's<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> comfort<00:00:30.179> factor<00:00:30.359> as

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that's going to be a comfort factor as

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.110 
that's going to be a comfort factor as
well<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> safety<00:00:31.500> factor<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.730> vent<00:00:32.969> system

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
well as a safety factor the vent system

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
well as a safety factor the vent system
on<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> speed<00:00:34.110> zip<00:00:34.350> vent<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
on this is the speed zip vent now you

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.250 
on this is the speed zip vent now you
have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.670> zipper<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.570> top<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> bicep

also<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> side<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.260> allows

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
also one on this side here that allows

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
also one on this side here that allows
the<00:00:40.440> air<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> body<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> jacket<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the air into the body of the jacket and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
the air into the body of the jacket and
the<00:00:42.450> exhaust<00:00:42.780> vents<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.200> located<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the exhaust vents are located on the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
the exhaust vents are located on the
back<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.340> you've<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> large<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.239> sort<00:00:46.020> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
back so you've got a large one sort of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.590 
back so you've got a large one sort of
down<00:00:46.289> low<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.710> body<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.149> them<00:00:48.480> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
down low on the body you have them on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.750 
down low on the body you have them on
each<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.219> tailor<00:00:50.489> how

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
each side so you can really tailor how

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
each side so you can really tailor how
much<00:00:50.969> air<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.210> coming<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
much air is coming in or out or if you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
much air is coming in or out or if you
want<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> retain<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.460> body<00:00:53.699> heat<00:00:53.879> since

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
want to retain that body heat since

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.700 
want to retain that body heat since
we're<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.020> let's<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.620> at
