00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
negatively he said she was proud of 10

negatively he said she was proud of 10
timing<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> easier<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
timing is easier which it is so it is a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.530 
timing is easier which it is so it is a
little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:31.549> interesting<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.390> easy

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
little bit interesting that was easy

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
little bit interesting that was easy
he's<00:01:33.869> trying<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> regain<00:01:34.470> his<00:01:34.650> ground<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
he's trying to regain his ground and we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.830 
he's trying to regain his ground and we
might<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> seeing<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
might be seeing a little bit of that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
might be seeing a little bit of that
here<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.350> he's<00:01:37.530> certainly<00:01:37.680> looked<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.100> he's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
here but he's certainly looked like he's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.219 
here but he's certainly looked like he's
getting<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> momentum<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.090> his<00:01:39.240> way<00:01:39.420> yeah

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
getting the momentum back his way yeah

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.569 
getting the momentum back his way yeah
he's<00:01:40.439> actually<00:01:40.590> getting<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.979> lot<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> damage

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
he's actually getting a lot of damage

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.499 
he's actually getting a lot of damage
right<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> Omni<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.420> now

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
right not the Omni right now

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.789 
right not the Omni right now
seventy-nine<00:01:43.079> percent<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.500> he's<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.680> get

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
seventy-nine percent and he's gonna get

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
seventy-nine percent and he's gonna get
more<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.280> down<00:01:44.520> thoroughfare<00:01:45.090> not

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
more with this down thoroughfare not

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
more with this down thoroughfare not
gonna<00:01:45.990> kill<00:01:46.229> quite<00:01:46.470> yet<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.640> able<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
gonna kill quite yet we might be able to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
gonna kill quite yet we might be able to
kill<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.210> throw<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> second

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
kill it down throw up here in a second

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.620 
kill it down throw up here in a second
that's<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.729> Sheik<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
that's or just do that Sheik is one of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
that's or just do that Sheik is one of
the<00:01:51.689> few<00:01:51.840> characters<00:01:52.259> who<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.740> get

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the few characters who can actually get

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.410 
the few characters who can actually get
a<00:01:53.040> follow<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> grabbing<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> should<00:01:54.329> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a follow up on a grabbing it should be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
a follow up on a grabbing it should be
puppet<00:01:54.750> mid<00:01:55.049> presents<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.979> very

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
puppet mid presents which is very

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.490 
puppet mid presents which is very
interesting<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.420> most<00:01:57.630> people<00:01:57.899> can't<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
interesting as most people can't and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
interesting as most people can't and
that<00:01:58.979> makes<00:01:59.189> us<00:01:59.340> magic<00:01:59.670> I'd<00:01:59.939> say<00:02:00.210> pretty<00:02:00.390> good

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that makes us magic I'd say pretty good

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300 
that makes us magic I'd say pretty good
