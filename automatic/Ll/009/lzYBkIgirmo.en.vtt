00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and I cannot stress this enough when I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549

say<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.750> tripod<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
say you are going to need a tripod a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.549 
say you are going to need a tripod a
tripod<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.670> basically<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.960> stand<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
tripod is basically just a stand that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
tripod is basically just a stand that
keeps<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.890> camera<00:00:56.309> steady<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
keeps your camera steady now if you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.049 
keeps your camera steady now if you
don't<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> tripod<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> suggest<00:00:59.850> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
don't have a tripod what I suggest you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
don't have a tripod what I suggest you
doing<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> probably<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> camera<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.039> top<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
doing is probably put a camera on top of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.719 
doing is probably put a camera on top of
a<00:01:02.520> stack<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.000> DVDs<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:04.080> CDs<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.830> wrap<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> rubber

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
a stack of DVDs or CDs and wrap a rubber

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
a stack of DVDs or CDs and wrap a rubber
band<00:01:05.909> around<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.260> over<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.740> keep<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
band around it over and over to keep the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.620 
band around it over and over to keep the
camera<00:01:08.460> steady<00:01:08.790> enough<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> where<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> could

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
camera steady enough to where you could

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.810 
camera steady enough to where you could
take<00:01:09.780> pictures<00:01:09.990> without<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.680> moving<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
take pictures without it moving but the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
take pictures without it moving but the
thing<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> tripod<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
thing is if you don't have a tripod you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing is if you don't have a tripod you
know<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.700> practice<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
know you could do that to practice I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990 
know you could do that to practice I
guess<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.740> first<00:01:16.979> time<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.909> if

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
guess if this is your first time but if

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
guess if this is your first time but if
you<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> tripod<00:01:19.110> you're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you don't have a tripod you're going to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
you don't have a tripod you're going to
need<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> buy<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> bottom

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
need to buy one that's just the bottom

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
need to buy one that's just the bottom
line<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> no<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.220> about<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
line for that no more to say about that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
line for that no more to say about that
onto<00:01:24.180> string<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.080> any<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
onto string you could use any kind of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
onto string you could use any kind of
string<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.009> materials<00:01:26.640> whether<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
string like materials whether it be the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
string like materials whether it be the
red<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.200> fishing<00:01:28.770> line<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.280> personally<00:01:30.030> use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
red or fishing line I personally use

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
red or fishing line I personally use
fishing<00:01:30.479> line<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:32.250> good<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.880> amount<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
fishing line and the good good amount of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
fishing line and the good good amount of
length<00:01:33.420> would<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.689> probably<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> tip<00:01:34.860> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
length would be probably from the tip of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
length would be probably from the tip of
your<00:01:35.040> finger<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.180> shoulder<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I don't ever tie it into the figures

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.830 
I don't ever tie it into the figures
because<00:01:41.670> sometimes<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.420> stuck<00:01:42.689> on

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
because sometimes it can get stuck on

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
because sometimes it can get stuck on
there<00:01:43.049> plus<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> can't<00:01:43.860> move<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> around<00:01:44.189> if

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
there plus you can't move it around if

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.609 
there plus you can't move it around if
you<00:01:44.640> tie<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.000> onto<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.299> figure<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.439> do

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you tie it onto a figure so what you do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.370 
you tie it onto a figure so what you do
is<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.100> tie<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.340> into<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> circle<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.329> take<00:01:49.140> each

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
is to tie it into a circle you take each

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
is to tie it into a circle you take each
end<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> fishing<00:01:50.369> line<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.820> you've

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
already cut or string and you kind of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 
already cut or string and you kind of
wrap<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.520> around<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> tie

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
wrap it around like you're going to tie

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
wrap it around like you're going to tie
a<00:01:54.750> knot<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.470> shoelace<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:57.030> pull<00:01:57.240> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a knot like a shoelace but don't pull on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870 
a knot like a shoelace but don't pull on
it<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.750> wrap<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> around<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.310> wrap

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it you wrap it around and then you wrap

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
it you wrap it around and then you wrap
it<00:01:59.909> around<00:02:00.149> again<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.380> pull<00:02:01.590> on

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it around again and then you pull on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.340 
it around again and then you pull on
that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
that

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.350 
that
and<00:02:02.590> then<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:02.830> should<00:02:03.010> stay<00:02:03.370> tight<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.090> put

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
and then it should stay tight and put

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.880 
and then it should stay tight and put
the<00:02:04.720> string<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.110> know<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.409> kind<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.650> pull<00:02:05.860> on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
the string you know just kind of pull on

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.860 
the string you know just kind of pull on
the<00:02:06.100> whole<00:02:06.280> thing<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.030> comes<00:02:07.240> apart<00:02:07.600> then

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
the whole thing if it comes apart then

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.930 
the whole thing if it comes apart then
try<00:02:08.110> again<00:02:08.170> or<00:02:08.679> cut<00:02:08.890> another<00:02:09.100> piece<00:02:09.190> since

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
try again or cut another piece since

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.760 
try again or cut another piece since
those<00:02:10.149> ends<00:02:10.360> might<00:02:10.630> be<00:02:10.780> already<00:02:11.050> like<00:02:11.350> tangled

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
those ends might be already like tangled

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.380 
those ends might be already like tangled
up<00:02:11.980> yeah<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:12.430> pretty<00:02:12.580> much<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:13.090> there<00:02:13.240> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
up yeah that's pretty much all there is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.970 
up yeah that's pretty much all there is
to<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> reason<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to it the reason I do this for the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.440 
to it the reason I do this for the
fishing<00:02:15.310> line<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.790> because<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.270> could<00:02:16.360> have

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
fishing line is because you could have

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.790 
fishing line is because you could have
wrap<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.780> around<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.080> shoulders<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.709> then

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
wrap it around the shoulders and then

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800 
wrap it around the shoulders and then
unwrap<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> same<00:02:18.850> time<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.660> don't

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
unwrap it at the same time and you don't

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.090 
unwrap it at the same time and you don't
really<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.260> grip<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.740> string<00:02:21.070> you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
really have to grip on the string you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.740 
really have to grip on the string you
kind<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.459> just<00:02:21.610> put<00:02:21.790> your<00:02:21.880> finger<00:02:22.270> around<00:02:22.570> it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
kind of just put your finger around it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.290 
kind of just put your finger around it

take a picture you move it you take a
picture<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.680> should<00:03:11.890> create<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.250> movement

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
picture and it should create a movement

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.190 
picture and it should create a movement
when<00:03:13.060> played<00:03:13.330> back<00:03:13.360> fast<00:03:15.840> once<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.959> get<00:03:17.110> to

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
when played back fast once you get to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.630 
when played back fast once you get to
the<00:03:17.320> part<00:03:17.560> where<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:18.070> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> need<00:03:18.489> to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the part where you're going to need to

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.850 
the part where you're going to need to
use<00:03:18.670> string<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.450> simply<00:03:20.079> use<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.590> round

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
use string you just simply use the round

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.229 
use string you just simply use the round
piece<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.220> string<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.700> demonstrated

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
piece of string that I demonstrated

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.970 
piece of string that I demonstrated
earlier<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.989> wrap<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.320> around<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.680> figures

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
earlier and wrap it around the figures

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.819 
earlier and wrap it around the figures
shoulders<00:03:24.549> now<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> good<00:03:25.660> reason<00:03:26.110> why<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.320> tied

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
shoulders now a good reason why I tied

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.620 
shoulders now a good reason why I tied
the<00:03:27.040> string<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> circle<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.090> because<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
the string in a circle is because you

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.240 
the string in a circle is because you
could<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:29.260> wrap<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.650> string<00:03:29.980> around

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
could actually wrap the string around

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.550 
could actually wrap the string around
your<00:03:30.400> ear<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.150> could<00:03:31.329> use<00:03:31.480> both<00:03:31.750> hands<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
your ear and you could use both hands to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.710 
your ear and you could use both hands to
move<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.010> joints<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.820> figure<00:03:34.150> without<00:03:34.360> it

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
move the joints of the figure without it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.110 
move the joints of the figure without it
messing<00:03:35.110> up<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.980> could<00:03:36.130> also<00:03:36.280> move<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
messing up and you could also move the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.690 
messing up and you could also move the
figure<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.690> mat<00:03:37.989> as<00:03:38.380> well<00:03:38.739> with<00:03:39.430> both

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
figure on the mat as well with both

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.539 
figure on the mat as well with both
hands<00:03:40.239> now<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.989> process<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.680> mainly<00:03:42.250> about

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
hands now this process is mainly about

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.090 
hands now this process is mainly about
being<00:03:43.000> patient<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.690> cannot<00:03:44.140> rush<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.860> kind

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
being patient you cannot rush this kind

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.310 
being patient you cannot rush this kind
of<00:03:45.190> work<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:46.060> go<00:03:46.299> into<00:03:46.480> more<00:03:46.720> detail<00:03:47.290> about

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
of work I will go into more detail about

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.410 
of work I will go into more detail about
certain<00:03:48.220> kind<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.519> moves<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.000> string

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
certain kind of moves and string

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.150 
certain kind of moves and string
placements<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.320> different<00:03:50.620> animations

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
placements and different animations

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.430 
placements and different animations
because<00:03:51.340> every<00:03:51.970> move<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.510> different<00:03:53.079> I<00:03:53.320> will

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
because every move is different I will

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.900 
because every move is different I will
make<00:03:53.590> different<00:03:53.739> kind<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.160> tutorials<00:03:54.730> on<00:03:54.850> that

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
make different kind of tutorials on that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.900 
make different kind of tutorials on that
later<00:03:55.360> on<00:03:55.480> now<00:03:56.170> here<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> speed<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.340> process

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
later on now here is a speed up process

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:08.360 
later on now here is a speed up process
of<00:03:58.090> me<00:03:58.239> animating<00:03:58.870> times<00:03:59.230> 7

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.820 

now<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.430> create<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.480> impact<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.380> blow<00:04:11.590> by

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
now to create the impact of the blow by

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.980 
now to create the impact of the blow by
making<00:04:12.310> rope<00:04:12.550> pounds<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.150> just<00:04:13.390> simply<00:04:13.750> grab

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
making rope pounds you just simply grab

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.020 
making rope pounds you just simply grab
all<00:04:14.260> three<00:04:14.590> pieces<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:15.040> rope<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.610> pull<00:04:15.880> them

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
all three pieces of rope and pull them

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.880 
all three pieces of rope and pull them
back<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.660> as<00:04:16.780> they're<00:04:17.080> bouncing<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.680> just

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
back and as they're bouncing you just

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.560 
back and as they're bouncing you just
take<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.310> picture<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.940> as<00:04:19.120> easy<00:04:19.269> as<00:04:19.540> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
take the picture it's as easy as that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.630 
take the picture it's as easy as that
and<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.019> looks<00:04:20.200> really<00:04:20.590> good<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:21.280> make<00:04:21.489> sure

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
and it looks really good just make sure

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.160 
and it looks really good just make sure
you<00:04:21.730> take<00:04:21.940> enough<00:04:22.060> pictures<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:22.990> the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
you take enough pictures to have the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.620 
you take enough pictures to have the
actual<00:04:23.470> movement<00:04:23.800> now<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.030> aftermath

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
actual movement now on to the aftermath

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.710 
actual movement now on to the aftermath
of<00:04:26.230> filming<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.160> editing<00:04:27.670> here<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:28.450> will

which<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.390> used<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.780> do<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.320> would

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
which is what I used to do and it would
