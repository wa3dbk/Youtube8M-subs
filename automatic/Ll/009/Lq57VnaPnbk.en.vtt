00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.810
 fizkult hello you day healthier it 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.550
 School of Tourism today we have a little review 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.910
 Do not the first review in Russia 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.010
 quadrocopter dj phantom 3 case 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.670
 that I am now at the presentation of this 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.280
 quadro holds his company sky meg in 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.100
 principle everyone was invited and so 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.540
 and became a fan after our campaign 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.750
 quadro aero photo-video shooting that drove 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.720
 on the presentation already managed on this 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.820
 the quadric has already managed to fly a bunch 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.079
 well and see for yourself 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 I grabbed the presentation literally on 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.570
 10-15 minutes to quickly make 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.060
 Your video review therefore no duplicates 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.800
 let's drive the main 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.369
 difference from phantom 2 and some bonuses 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.530
 which I noticed in these differences begin 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.259
 we powerplant it changed 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 here are new engines and they stand slightly 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.920
 at an angle plus to the power plant 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.319
 have replaced the battery 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.090
 battery voltage is higher i.e. 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:40.280
 he is now four banks 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.789
 exactly the same form factor but voltage 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.459
 higher and therefore no more currents 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.649
 know marketing moves then companies 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.740
 DJ to all owners 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 phantoms also replace batteries 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.009
 transition to the new version but flies quadr 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.869
 noticeably faster that is, he is faster 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:07.429
 his weight is definitely greater 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.590
 than the second what is 2 vision plus and this 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.069
 visible to the naked eye just 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.810
 here here they made 2 quad 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.319
 full thrust sticks forward and was seen as 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.930
 phantom 3 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.030
 ulytau from the old version as from standing 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.610
 while the screws as far as I understand 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.240
 probably remained the same anyway 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.380
 visually 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.670
 I am the difference 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.760
 I see the chapel and the hull and legs differences 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.220
 they are minimal down to millimeter but 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.460
 yet most likely not 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.080
 match each other like sloping 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.340
 screws and flies all slightly changed 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.780
 the most important part in my opinion is not even 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.710
 flight which has changed in this 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 quadcopter 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:03:00.650
 this is a camera and now the camera has become here 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.730
 exactly the same as in in spa and revan 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.730
 that means 4k and 30 frames per second and 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.990
 declares that she is shooting beautifully this 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.930
 perhaps more important than the dry numbers from 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:20.780
 of what I saw with the smartphone she 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.530
 can be managed quite advanced 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.630
 adjust you can stir up exposure compensation 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.270
 during the flight here this 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.290
 the wheel changes the exposure compensation in 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.900
 shooting time 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.860
 also during the flight manually changed 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.640
 photo and video shooting modes for example 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.090
 you can change 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.420
 Aisa, you can change the shutter speed 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.170
 really cool so another important point 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.150
 This is what there is no high-speed shooting 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.490
 anyway now in this 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.750
 firmware from what I saw you can 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.910
 You can shoot 60 frames full hd 60 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.459
 Frame afraid to lie but I think at 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.450
 higher resolution also exhibited 60 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.360
 Frames, that is, 2 out of 7 k, also put 60 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.330
 Frames in general since the camera is from the insur 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.350
 and they say that she shoots better than 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.270
 gopro hero 4 but we really 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.580
 check because we are doing now 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:24.800
 review on gopro hero 4 silver and we wore 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.070
 quadrocopters in the key with the included 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.390
 camera and a cat here and so close and 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.760
 accordingly we will see 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.190
 How does a picture differ? 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.030
 of course it's all at different resolutions 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.810
 but color details are more important to us 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.980
 pictures than even there treasured 4k 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.350
 so on along the phantom carcass itself and on 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.460
 camera to tell everything here but in essence 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.980
 nothing else 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.590
 go ulta let recycled 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.700
 significantly and again taken as a basis 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.270
 remote from the Old aero there immediately 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.390
 Record button video recording under the left 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.010
 finger there is a photo button and there is a button 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.710
 mode from view from what you 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.380
 photographed or filmed 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.480
 this allows not planting phantom not 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.940
 returning it somewhere to the starting point 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.480
 flight view footage you 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.940
 got further there are two wheels one 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.690
 Immediately makes exposure compensation here this 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.510
 right 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.850
 and accordingly when you turn over 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.430
 if from some dark place in the sun 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.180
 you can quickly fix the picture and 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.450
 the second wheel controls the camera here I am 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.920
 I'm not going to take off now 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.680
 generally manages further there are two 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.510
 custom buttons 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.180
 they can be programmed for different 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.030
 default actions on one of them 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.600
 sewn up fast turn the camera strictly 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.720
 down and strictly horizontally 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.660
 convenient enough to have the buttons click 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.360
 and quadcopter immediately flies home and 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.520
 auto mode tries to sit down and 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.520
 most likely sits down if the surface 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.900
 smooth also reworked this here 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.480
 mount for smart phones well here now 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.630
 will climb and the tablet appeared we have two 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.180
 An antenna instead of one is such 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.490
 mount conveniently enough look 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.169
 the whole console is folded as follows 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.659
 way 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.990
 so power is now built 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:38.999
 battery and charging one 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.099
 and on the battery and on the remote for someone this 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:45.240
 comfortably speak battery is enough 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.919
 really much like the type there for 8 flights 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.740
 eight to ten flight enough 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:53.310
 battery on this we are such a blitz review 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.919
 we finish right away after the hike 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.740
 I just fell in love with quadcopters 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.909
 I think this is incredibly masculine cool 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:06.300
 toys and compulsory companion of all 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:08.430
 future tourists and travelers with 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.300
 you were dinistor drink it was a school 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.080
 tourism 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:16.699
 fly safe walk and hike 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.699
 travel good luck to you all
