now with this one

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.370 
now with this one
it<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.190> same<00:02:45.489> sort<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.360> consistency<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
it is the same sort of consistency the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.699 
it is the same sort of consistency the
only<00:02:47.680> thing<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:49.300> feel<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.440> kind

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
only thing is that the feel of it kind

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.330 
only thing is that the feel of it kind
of<00:02:51.060> reminds<00:02:52.060> me<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.239> glue<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:53.350> dries<00:02:53.950> really

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
of reminds me of glue so it dries really

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.729 
of reminds me of glue so it dries really
really<00:02:54.670> fast<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.390> don't<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:56.200> barely<00:02:56.560> have

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
really fast you don't you barely have

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.190 
really fast you don't you barely have
time<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.070> put<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:57.970> onto<00:02:58.090> your<00:02:58.360> face<00:02:58.420> because<00:02:59.050> it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
time to put it onto your face because it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.620 
time to put it onto your face because it
just<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.590> dries<00:02:59.950> so<00:02:59.980> quickly<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.300> when<00:03:01.510> you're

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
just it dries so quickly so when you're

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.170 
just it dries so quickly so when you're
putting<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.980> dries<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:04.090> you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
putting it on and if it dries then you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.000 
putting it on and if it dries then you
have<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.420> put<00:03:04.570> another<00:03:04.810> layer<00:03:05.050> on<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.739> that's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
have to put another layer on and that's

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.479 
have to put another layer on and that's
when<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.370> starts<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.820> feel<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.239> bit<00:03:07.709> icky<00:03:08.709> from

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
when it starts to feel a bit icky from

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.350 
when it starts to feel a bit icky from
what<00:03:09.700> I've<00:03:09.850> had<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.310> past<00:03:12.489> what<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> really

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
what I've had in the past what I really

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.449 
what I've had in the past what I really
like<00:03:13.540> about<00:03:13.570> this<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.070> still<00:03:15.430> has

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
like about this is that it it still has

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.410 
like about this is that it it still has
a<00:03:15.610> pump<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:18.370> pump<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.910> when<00:03:19.239> we<00:03:19.269> first

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
a pump but this pump and I when we first

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.050 
a pump but this pump and I when we first
got<00:03:19.840> together<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:21.220> didn't<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.640> me<00:03:21.820> I

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
got together it didn't like me I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.699 
got together it didn't like me I
probably<00:03:22.360> pumped<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.940> about<00:03:25.560> twenty<00:03:26.560> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
probably pumped this about twenty to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.160 
probably pumped this about twenty to
thirty<00:03:26.980> times<00:03:27.269> before<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.299> actually<00:03:28.360> got<00:03:28.840> any

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
thirty times before I actually got any

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.470 
thirty times before I actually got any
product<00:03:29.680> out<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.040> first<00:03:30.280> time<00:03:30.489> not<00:03:31.180> even

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
product out the first time not even

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.229 
product out the first time not even
kidding<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:33.340> amount<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.970> pumps

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
kidding you and the amount that it pumps

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.390 
kidding you and the amount that it pumps
out<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.540> really<00:03:34.780> really<00:03:35.049> good<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.590> think<00:03:35.739> one

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
out is really really good I think one

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.539 
out is really really good I think one
pump<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.910> good<00:03:37.239> now<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> feel<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.500> maybe<00:03:39.220> with

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
pump is good now I feel like maybe with

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.729 
pump is good now I feel like maybe with
the<00:03:40.000> veil<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.690> probably<00:03:41.019> need<00:03:41.170> like<00:03:41.200> one<00:03:41.620> and

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
the veil you probably need like one and

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.490 
the veil you probably need like one and
a<00:03:41.829> half<00:03:42.010> pumps<00:03:42.310> that's<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.090> me<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.170> don't<00:03:44.380> know

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
a half pumps that's just me I don't know

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.539 
a half pumps that's just me I don't know
I'm<00:03:44.799> really<00:03:44.829> odd

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
I'm really odd

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.530 
I'm really odd
so<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.900> go<00:03:47.019> with<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:48.459> really<00:03:48.790> like<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
so just go with it and I really like the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.630 
so just go with it and I really like the
packaging<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:50.920> really<00:03:51.100> nice<00:03:51.400> and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
packaging of this it's really nice and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.970 
packaging of this it's really nice and
sleek<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.209> goes<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.260> logo<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> she

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980

primer<00:05:47.440> did<00:05:47.770> just<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.729> when<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.270> use<00:05:49.600> this

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
primer did just because when I use this

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.120 
primer did just because when I use this
one<00:05:50.229> I<00:05:50.580> rarely<00:05:52.050> have<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.260> take<00:05:53.650> out<00:05:53.800> my<00:05:53.830> powder

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
one I rarely have to take out my powder

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.700 
one I rarely have to take out my powder
I<00:05:54.490> probably<00:05:55.270> have<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.660> take<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.930> out<00:05:56.080> once<00:05:56.380> and

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
I probably have to take it out once and

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.980 
I probably have to take it out once and
that's<00:05:56.890> only<00:05:57.130> if<00:05:57.460> like<00:05:58.060> I'm<00:05:58.240> outside<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.750> lot

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
that's only if like I'm outside a lot

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.460 
that's only if like I'm outside a lot
and<00:05:59.260> doing<00:05:59.410> errands<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.430> I'm<00:06:01.180> like<00:06:01.870> sweating

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
and doing errands and I'm like sweating

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.620 
and doing errands and I'm like sweating
up<00:06:02.680> a<00:06:02.770> storm<00:06:02.800> if<00:06:03.400> it's<00:06:03.640> hot<00:06:03.880> outside

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
up a storm if it's hot outside

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.710 
up a storm if it's hot outside
and<00:06:04.720> with<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.830> featherweight<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.720> always

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
and with the featherweight I always

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.800 
and with the featherweight I always
found<00:06:08.440> myself<00:06:08.820> blotting<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:09.850> putting<00:06:10.630> on

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
found myself blotting and putting on

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.100 
found myself blotting and putting on
powder<00:06:11.560> it<00:06:12.400> was<00:06:12.610> probably<00:06:13.000> about<00:06:13.180> 2<00:06:13.720> to<00:06:13.900> 3

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
powder it was probably about 2 to 3

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.090 
powder it was probably about 2 to 3
times<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.500> day<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:15.039> I<00:06:15.580> have<00:06:16.419> a<00:06:16.780> desk<00:06:17.500> job<00:06:17.800> I

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
times a day and I have a desk job I

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.270 
times a day and I have a desk job I
don't<00:06:18.220> get<00:06:18.850> up<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.150> move<00:06:19.419> a<00:06:19.570> lot<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:20.200> I<00:06:20.590> use

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
don't get up and move a lot and I use

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.830 
don't get up and move a lot and I use
this<00:06:21.490> throughout<00:06:21.820> the<00:06:21.970> week<00:06:22.120> when<00:06:22.510> I<00:06:22.539> was

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
this throughout the week when I was

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.830 
this throughout the week when I was
working<00:06:23.410> in<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.950> day<00:06:24.070> I<00:06:24.100> was<00:06:24.640> doing<00:06:24.880> errands

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
working in the day I was doing errands

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.600 
working in the day I was doing errands
I<00:06:25.900> completely<00:06:26.940> hated<00:06:27.940> it<00:06:28.090> I<00:06:28.330> would<00:06:29.250> have

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
I completely hated it I would have

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.970 
I completely hated it I would have
I<00:06:30.639> felt<00:06:31.330> like<00:06:31.449> my<00:06:31.660> foundation<00:06:32.350> was<00:06:32.530> dripping

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
I felt like my foundation was dripping

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.640 
I felt like my foundation was dripping
off<00:06:33.130> my<00:06:33.370> face<00:06:33.610> that's<00:06:34.389> literally<00:06:34.840> how<00:06:35.020> I<00:06:35.199> felt

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
off my face that's literally how I felt

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.860 
off my face that's literally how I felt
so<00:06:36.430> all<00:06:37.300> in<00:06:37.600> all<00:06:37.720> I<00:06:38.250> would<00:06:39.250> say<00:06:39.570> to<00:06:40.570> go<00:06:40.750> ahead

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
so all in all I would say to go ahead

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.740 
so all in all I would say to go ahead
and<00:06:41.260> do<00:06:41.380> the<00:06:41.530> splurge<00:06:41.889> if<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:42.550> have<00:06:42.820> oily

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
and do the splurge if you have oily

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.060 
and do the splurge if you have oily
problems<00:06:44.169> like<00:06:44.350> I<00:06:44.560> do

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
problems like I do

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.400 
problems like I do
I<00:06:45.100> would<00:06:45.520> really<00:06:45.729> go<00:06:45.940> with<00:06:46.120> this<00:06:46.330> one<00:06:46.600> it<00:06:46.870> has<00:06:47.080> a

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
I would really go with this one it has a

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.710 
I would really go with this one it has a
really<00:06:47.830> good<00:06:48.070> consistency<00:06:48.669> in<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:49.240> it's

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
really good consistency in it it's

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.020 
really good consistency in it it's
really<00:06:50.229> rare<00:06:50.650> when<00:06:51.130> you<00:06:51.250> ever<00:06:51.370> you'd<00:06:51.669> have<00:06:51.850> to

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
really rare when you ever you'd have to

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.520 
really rare when you ever you'd have to
start<00:06:52.300> to<00:06:52.600> take<00:06:52.780> out<00:06:52.900> your<00:06:53.050> powder<00:06:53.260> or

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
start to take out your powder or

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.350 
start to take out your powder or
anything<00:06:53.770> like<00:06:54.070> that<00:06:54.130> so<00:06:54.580> I<00:06:54.970> would<00:06:55.090> really

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
anything like that so I would really

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.900 
anything like that so I would really
really<00:06:55.630> go<00:06:55.780> with<00:06:56.020> the<00:06:56.470> veil<00:06:56.800> it<00:06:57.490> took<00:06:57.760> me<00:06:57.880> a

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
really go with the veil it took me a

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.450 
really go with the veil it took me a
really<00:06:58.000> really<00:06:58.930> long<00:06:59.169> time<00:06:59.200> to<00:06:59.500> buy<00:06:59.830> this<00:06:59.889> just

just completely convinced me to just
finally<00:07:12.250> get<00:07:12.550> it<00:07:12.700> and<00:07:12.940> I<00:07:13.060> bit<00:07:13.330> the<00:07:13.450> bullet<00:07:13.600> and

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
ever since then I would bite that bullet

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.290 
ever since then I would bite that bullet
every<00:07:17.560> single<00:07:17.860> time<00:07:18.039> I'm<00:07:18.370> not<00:07:18.639> even<00:07:18.850> kidding

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
every single time I'm not even kidding

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.540 
every single time I'm not even kidding
so<00:07:19.720> I<00:07:19.750> would<00:07:20.050> just<00:07:20.229> say<00:07:20.380> go<00:07:20.620> ahead<00:07:20.740> and<00:07:21.190> get

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
so I would just say go ahead and get

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.240 
so I would just say go ahead and get
this<00:07:21.729> one<00:07:22.030> all<00:07:22.690> in<00:07:22.930> all<00:07:23.080> go<00:07:23.590> ahead<00:07:23.830> and<00:07:24.039> try

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
this one all in all go ahead and try

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.070 
this one all in all go ahead and try
different<00:07:24.310> primers<00:07:25.000> and<00:07:25.300> see<00:07:25.479> if<00:07:25.600> they<00:07:25.810> work

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 
different primers and see if they work

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.850 
different primers and see if they work
for<00:07:26.410> you<00:07:26.590> but<00:07:27.580> if<00:07:27.760> all<00:07:28.030> else<00:07:28.270> fails<00:07:28.680> just<00:07:29.680> get

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
than likely this one's gonna get

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.650 
than likely this one's gonna get
returned<00:07:33.460> because<00:07:33.700> I<00:07:33.910> don't<00:07:34.360> like<00:07:34.479> keeping
