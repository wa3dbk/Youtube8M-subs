00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.450 

all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.140> let's<00:00:01.469> look<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.860> temperature

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right let's look at the temperature

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.289 
all right let's look at the temperature
of<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.090> CPU<00:00:03.859> so<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.250> BIOS<00:00:05.549> I'm<00:00:06.089> gonna

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
of the CPU so I'm in my BIOS I'm gonna

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.280 
of the CPU so I'm in my BIOS I'm gonna
go<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.660> system<00:00:06.899> monitor<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:09.570> right<00:00:09.870> here

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
go to a system monitor and right here

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.360 
go to a system monitor and right here
says<00:00:10.889> my<00:00:11.130> CPU<00:00:11.870> is<00:00:12.870> running<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.469> 57<00:00:14.099> degrees

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
says my CPU is running at 57 degrees

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.660 
says my CPU is running at 57 degrees
Celsius<00:00:15.949> now<00:00:16.949> that's<00:00:17.190> that's<00:00:17.580> kind<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.060> hot<00:00:18.270> so

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
Celsius now that's that's kind of hot so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.189 
Celsius now that's that's kind of hot so
since<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:20.850> computer<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.390> running<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.810> stock

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
since my computer is running in stock

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
since my computer is running in stock
speed<00:00:22.529> right<00:00:22.769> now<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.250> think<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.910> should<00:00:24.029> be

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
speed right now I think it should be

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269 
speed right now I think it should be
somewhere<00:00:24.510> around<00:00:24.600> 40<00:00:25.140> degrees<00:00:25.439> Celsius<00:00:26.010> so

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
somewhere around 40 degrees Celsius so

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
somewhere around 40 degrees Celsius so
what<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.119> tells<00:00:27.390> me<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
what that tells me is I think the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.400 
what that tells me is I think the
thermal<00:00:29.010> paste<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:30.480> compound<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.109> actually

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
thermal paste the compound is actually

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
thermal paste the compound is actually
failing<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> actually

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
failing so what I have to do is actually

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.870 
failing so what I have to do is actually
take<00:00:33.719> apart<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.170> computer

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
take apart my computer

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
take apart my computer
take<00:00:35.880> off<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> cooler<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.219> redo<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> thermal

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
take off the cooler and redo the thermal

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.590 
take off the cooler and redo the thermal
compound<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.329> my<00:00:39.450> CPU<00:00:41.000> now<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.329> let's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
compound on my CPU now first let's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:55.580 
compound on my CPU now first let's
unscrew<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> case<00:00:53.809> okay<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> want<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> do

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
unscrew the case okay what I want to do

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.849 
unscrew the case okay what I want to do
is<00:00:55.770> solve<00:00:56.100> an<00:00:56.309> overheating<00:00:56.879> problem<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> first

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
is solve an overheating problem so first

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670 
is solve an overheating problem so first
a<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.879> at<00:01:00.030> each<00:01:00.180> van<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:01.170> sure<00:01:01.320> there's<00:01:01.530> no

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
a look at each van make sure there's no

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.899 
a look at each van make sure there's no
dust<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.489> okay<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.229> here

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
dust on it okay like this right here

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.899 
dust on it okay like this right here
it's<00:01:05.909> also<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.270> vent<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:10.909> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's also a vent right here and it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
it's also a vent right here and it
doesn't<00:01:12.180> look<00:01:12.299> too<00:01:12.540> bad<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
doesn't look too bad but what I want to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:27.039 
doesn't look too bad but what I want to
do<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.310> remove<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> entire<00:01:15.270> cover

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.670 

can<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
can you see that

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:42.340 
can you see that
that's<00:01:28.829> pretty<00:01:29.070> dusty<00:01:30.950> I'm<00:01:31.950> Ashley<00:01:32.340> grab

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:55.569

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.300 

all<00:01:56.579> right<00:01:56.789> we're<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> remove<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.799> CPU

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
all right we're going to remove the CPU

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
all right we're going to remove the CPU
and<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.170> first<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.679> remove

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and to do that first we have to remove

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.830 
and to do that first we have to remove
this<00:02:02.250> fan<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.500> heatsink<00:02:04.500> combo<00:02:05.840> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this fan and heatsink combo this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.779 
this fan and heatsink combo this
particular<00:02:07.170> unit<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.860> expose<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
particular unit just to expose the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270 
particular unit just to expose the
screws<00:02:09.560> actually<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.830> remove<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
screws actually have to remove with the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.100 
screws actually have to remove with the
fan<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:14.069> screws<00:02:14.579> onto<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.030> heatsink<00:02:15.540> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
fan that screws onto the heatsink so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:32.559 
fan that screws onto the heatsink so
let's<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.380> first

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:42.380 

okay<00:02:37.129> now<00:02:38.129> there's<00:02:38.430> some<00:02:38.700> dust<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:41.390> so

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
okay now there's some dust on this so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.840 
okay now there's some dust on this so
I'm<00:02:42.450> actually<00:02:42.660> gonna<00:02:42.870> wipe<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.609> moist<00:02:44.609> paper

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
I'm actually gonna wipe that moist paper

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
I'm actually gonna wipe that moist paper
towel<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.650> I'm<00:02:46.709> gonna<00:02:46.799> remove<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.359> fan<00:02:48.630> by

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
towel so I'm gonna remove it the fan by

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.509 
towel so I'm gonna remove it the fan by
unplugging<00:02:49.139> it<00:02:49.470> from<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.280> motherboard<00:02:52.519> and

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
unplugging it from the motherboard and

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.150 
unplugging it from the motherboard and
we'll<00:02:53.639> go<00:02:53.760> clean<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.030> off<00:02:54.299> first<00:02:54.769> okay<00:02:55.799> my

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we'll go clean that off first okay my

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.870 
we'll go clean that off first okay my
fan<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:57.060> nice<00:02:57.389> and<00:02:57.600> clean<00:02:58.400> now<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.760> to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
fan is nice and clean now I have to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.599 
fan is nice and clean now I have to
remove<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> heatsink<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:01.370> looks<00:03:02.370> really

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
remove the heatsink which looks really

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:34.629 
remove the heatsink which looks really
dirty<00:03:14.900> these<00:03:15.900> screws<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.410> spring-loaded

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.280

if you have a catalog item you might

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.780 
if you have a catalog item you might
want<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.590> clean<00:03:37.799> out<00:03:37.919> your<00:03:38.099> computer<00:03:38.549> every

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
want to clean out your computer every

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.629 
want to clean out your computer every
couple<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.120> months

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
couple of months

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.550 
couple of months
these<00:03:41.639> computers<00:03:42.209> they<00:03:42.810> suck<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.380> whole

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
these computers they suck in a whole

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.689 
these computers they suck in a whole
bunch<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.889> dust<00:03:45.530> when<00:03:46.530> they<00:03:46.769> suck<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.250> all<00:03:47.489> that

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
bunch of dust when they suck in all that

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.370 
bunch of dust when they suck in all that
dust

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.660 
hot they tend to break vice let's see
okay<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:05.800> that's<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.130> loose<00:04:06.450> look<00:04:07.450> at<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
okay so that's a loose look at that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.270 
okay so that's a loose look at that
that's<00:04:09.670> probably<00:04:10.000> why<00:04:10.240> my<00:04:10.330> computer<00:04:11.280> it's

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that's probably why my computer it's

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.260 
that's probably why my computer it's
temperature<00:04:12.730> was<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> little<00:04:13.300> too<00:04:13.420> high<00:04:13.630> huh

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
temperature was a little too high huh

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.510 
temperature was a little too high huh
back<00:04:16.270> is<00:04:16.510> not<00:04:16.720> bad<00:04:16.960> just<00:04:17.560> over<00:04:17.860> here<00:04:18.130> where

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
back is not bad just over here where

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.630 
back is not bad just over here where
sucks<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.710> so<00:04:20.710> now<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:20.920> have<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.220> clean<00:04:21.460> that

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
sucks it in so now I have to clean that

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.670 
sucks it in so now I have to clean that
out<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:23.050> way<00:04:23.170> I'm<00:04:23.290> going<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.500> do<00:04:23.590> it

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
out and the way I'm going to do it

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.880 
out and the way I'm going to do it
actually<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.930> I'm<00:04:25.930> gonna<00:04:26.080> spray<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.500> off<00:04:26.650> with

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
actually is I'm gonna spray it off with

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.530 
actually is I'm gonna spray it off with
water<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:28.960> dry<00:04:29.230> it<00:04:29.260> off<00:04:29.560> thoroughly<00:04:30.540> and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
water and then dry it off thoroughly and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.930 
water and then dry it off thoroughly and
over<00:04:32.260> here<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:33.130> could<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.580> thermal

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
over here you could see the thermal

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.380 
over here you could see the thermal
paste<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:37.090> also<00:04:37.690> I'm<00:04:38.140> gonna<00:04:38.350> scrub<00:04:38.710> off<00:04:39.390> and

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
paste that also I'm gonna scrub off and

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.360 
paste that also I'm gonna scrub off and
I'm<00:04:40.690> gonna<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:40.990> scrub<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.470> off<00:04:41.650> my<00:04:41.860> cpu

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
I'm gonna have to scrub that off my cpu

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.290 
I'm gonna have to scrub that off my cpu
also<00:04:45.210> alright<00:04:46.210> now<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.660> watched<00:04:47.140> this<00:04:48.300> heat

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
also alright now I watched this heat

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.840 
also alright now I watched this heat
sink<00:04:50.640> with<00:04:51.640> water<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.990> dry<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.700> believe<00:04:54.700> it

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
sink with water and to dry it believe it

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.900 
sink with water and to dry it believe it
or<00:04:54.940> not<00:04:55.090> actually<00:04:55.360> just<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.930> leaf<00:04:56.140> blower<00:04:56.910> it's

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
or not actually just a leaf blower it's

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.430 
or not actually just a leaf blower it's
a<00:04:58.030> lot<00:04:58.390> quicker<00:04:58.840> than<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.140> hairdryer<00:05:01.440> so

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
a lot quicker than the hairdryer so

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.900 
a lot quicker than the hairdryer so
there's<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.800> little<00:05:03.070> tip<00:05:03.280> it's<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.670> little

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
there's a little tip it's a little

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.790 
there's a little tip it's a little
extreme<00:05:04.240> but<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.690> works<00:05:07.410> alright<00:05:08.410> now<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.650> have

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
extreme but it works alright now I have

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.320 
extreme but it works alright now I have
to<00:05:08.920> remove<00:05:09.190> my<00:05:09.430> CPU<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.820> have<00:05:12.940> to<00:05:13.060> clean<00:05:13.270> up

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
to remove my CPU and I have to clean up

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.740 
to remove my CPU and I have to clean up
the<00:05:13.570> thermal<00:05:13.990> paste<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.030> could<00:05:19.330> put<00:05:19.480> a<00:05:19.510> new

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
the thermal paste so I could put a new

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.400 
the thermal paste so I could put a new
thermal<00:05:20.170> paste<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.650> reassemble<00:05:21.250> everything

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
thermal paste and reassemble everything

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.710 
thermal paste and reassemble everything
so<00:05:23.410> then<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.620> can<00:05:23.800> see<00:05:23.980> it's<00:05:24.160> all<00:05:24.450> goop<00:05:25.450> down

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
so then you can see it's all goop down

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.630 
so then you can see it's all goop down
there<00:05:26.910> alright<00:05:28.000> CPU<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:28.990> clean<00:05:29.340> now<00:05:30.340> make<00:05:30.610> sure

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
there alright CPU is clean now make sure

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.820 
there alright CPU is clean now make sure
you<00:05:31.000> install<00:05:31.210> your<00:05:31.450> CPU<00:05:31.870> properly<00:05:32.410> look<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.800> a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
you install your CPU properly look for a

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.180 
you install your CPU properly look for a
little<00:05:33.070> cutouts<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:34.620> don't<00:05:35.620> want<00:05:35.740> to<00:05:35.860> bend

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
little cutouts you don't want to bend

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:54.549 
little cutouts you don't want to bend
depend<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:36.670> your<00:05:36.760> CPU<00:05:36.970> you<00:05:37.360> you'll<00:05:37.600> be<00:05:37.750> screwed

00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:54.559 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.589 

okay<00:05:55.559> here<00:05:55.860> we<00:05:55.919> go

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
okay here we go

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.869 
okay here we go
I'm<00:05:57.599> gonna<00:05:57.749> play<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.679> little<00:05:58.770> bit<00:05:59.639> of<00:05:59.729> this

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
I'm gonna play a little bit of this

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:13.879 
I'm gonna play a little bit of this
compound<00:06:02.149> the<00:06:03.149> center<00:06:03.689> of<00:06:03.779> the<00:06:03.869> CPU<00:06:11.809> okay<00:06:12.889> once

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
compound the center of the CPU okay once

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.369 
compound the center of the CPU okay once
I<00:06:14.069> put<00:06:14.309> the<00:06:14.869> heatsink<00:06:15.869> on

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
I put the heatsink on

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:55.879 
I put the heatsink on
oh<00:06:16.409> actually<00:06:16.709> suppress<00:06:18.469> okay<00:06:54.589> before<00:06:55.589> I<00:06:55.619> made

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
oh actually suppress okay before I made

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.949 
oh actually suppress okay before I made
this<00:06:56.069> video<00:06:57.709> my<00:06:58.709> computer<00:06:59.430> was<00:06:59.639> running<00:06:59.959> 57

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:00.959 
this video my computer was running 57

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.949 
this video my computer was running 57
degrees<00:07:01.319> Celsius<00:07:01.949> on<00:07:02.099> idle<00:07:02.610> which<00:07:03.419> is<00:07:03.569> pretty

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:03.959 
degrees Celsius on idle which is pretty

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:33.670 
degrees Celsius on idle which is pretty
high<00:07:05.539> but<00:07:06.539> I<00:07:06.599> knew<00:07:06.779> something<00:07:07.169> was<00:07:07.289> wrong<00:07:07.319> in

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.699 

this<00:07:34.680> computer<00:07:35.009> up<00:07:39.110> should<00:07:40.110> our<00:07:40.289> heating

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:40.709 
this computer up should our heating

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:45.859 
this computer up should our heating
problem<00:07:42.229> that<00:07:43.229> was<00:07:43.349> fixed<00:07:43.740> I<00:07:44.689> should<00:07:45.689> say

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:45.869 
problem that was fixed I should say

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:51.439 
problem that was fixed I should say
overheat<00:07:49.069> okay<00:07:50.069> before<00:07:50.369> my<00:07:50.759> computer<00:07:51.240> was

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449 
overheat okay before my computer was

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.379 
overheat okay before my computer was
running<00:07:52.110> a<00:07:52.199> stack<00:07:52.529> speed<00:07:52.860> 2.4<00:07:53.550> gigahertz<00:07:53.819> and

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389 
running a stack speed 2.4 gigahertz and

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:58.249 
running a stack speed 2.4 gigahertz and
at<00:07:55.169> temperatures<00:07:55.879> 57<00:07:56.879> degrees<00:07:57.240> Celsius<00:07:57.779> now

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 
at temperatures 57 degrees Celsius now

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:00.619 
at temperatures 57 degrees Celsius now
you<00:07:58.319> can<00:07:58.709> see<00:07:58.919> I'm<00:07:59.430> running<00:07:59.579> at<00:07:59.879> 3.1<00:08:00.419> and

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:00.629 
you can see I'm running at 3.1 and

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:02.350 
you can see I'm running at 3.1 and
gigahertz<00:08:00.899> I'm<00:08:01.289> overclocked

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 
gigahertz I'm overclocked

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:09.409 
gigahertz I'm overclocked
and<00:08:03.360> my<00:08:03.779> temperature<00:08:04.289> is<00:08:07.369> 46<00:08:08.369> degrees<00:08:08.789> Celsius

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 
and my temperature is 46 degrees Celsius

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:11.570 
and my temperature is 46 degrees Celsius
so<00:08:09.930> we<00:08:10.080> definitely<00:08:10.589> saw<00:08:10.800> the<00:08:10.860> overheating

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 
so we definitely saw the overheating

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.309 
so we definitely saw the overheating
problem<00:08:11.999> by<00:08:12.180> doing<00:08:12.240> what<00:08:12.659> we<00:08:12.779> just<00:08:12.930> did<00:08:13.110> in<00:08:13.289> the

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 
problem by doing what we just did in the

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.499 
problem by doing what we just did in the
video
