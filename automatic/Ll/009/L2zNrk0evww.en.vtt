other app should do you can zoom in zoom
out<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> pretty<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.330> infinite

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
out you pretty much have infinite

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.090 
out you pretty much have infinite
zooming<00:01:10.610> unlike<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.470> built-in<00:01:13.470> photo<00:01:13.830> app

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
zooming unlike the built-in photo app

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.300 
zooming unlike the built-in photo app
you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.610> move<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:16.130> pretty<00:01:17.130> much

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you can move it around so pretty much

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.210 
you can move it around so pretty much
everything<00:01:17.670> you'd<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.950> viewing

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
everything you'd want to do for viewing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.820 
everything you'd want to do for viewing
it<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.780> resizing<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.680> let's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it but the point is resizing it so let's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.999 
it but the point is resizing it so let's
do<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.540> resize<00:01:25.320> current<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
do that so there's the resize current so

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.819 
do that so there's the resize current so
if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.340> want<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> resize<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.540> time

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
if you just want to resize one at a time

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.810 
if you just want to resize one at a time
hit<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.040> button<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.430> maintain<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
hit this button you can maintain the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.640 
hit this button you can maintain the
aspect<00:01:33.240> ratio<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> rece

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
aspect ratio which means when you rece

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
aspect ratio which means when you rece
when<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> set<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:36.000> values<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.350> other

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
when you set these values the other

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940 
when you set these values the other
value<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.189> automatically<00:01:39.200> change<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.770> make

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
value will automatically change to make

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.760 
value will automatically change to make
sure<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> image<00:01:42.200> stays<00:01:43.200> undistorted

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
sure that the image stays undistorted

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980 
sure that the image stays undistorted
basically<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> don't<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> squished<00:01:45.750> or

hit<00:02:17.950> resize<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.670> say<00:02:18.849> before<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.270> do<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
hit resize and say before I do that you

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.170 
hit resize and say before I do that you
can<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:20.080> there's<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.410> help<00:02:20.680> message<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.790> every

can see there's a help message for every

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.960 
can see there's a help message for every
feature<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.620> should<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.340> able<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.640> figure<00:02:24.760> out

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
feature so should be able to figure out

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.680 
feature so should be able to figure out
everything<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:26.069> resize<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.370> save<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.540> when

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
everything so resize and save so when

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.830 
everything so resize and save so when
you<00:02:28.780> resize<00:02:29.850> wasn't<00:02:30.850> quick<00:02:30.970> enough<00:02:31.030> but<00:02:31.510> it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you resize wasn't quick enough but it

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.410 
you resize wasn't quick enough but it
shows<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.080> message<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:33.000> plays<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> sound

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
shows a message there plays a sound

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.080 
shows a message there plays a sound
which<00:02:34.750> might<00:02:35.020> have<00:02:35.170> been<00:02:35.400> too<00:02:36.400> low<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
which might have been too low for this

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.340 
which might have been too low for this
camera<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.780> pick<00:02:37.989> up<00:02:39.569> anyways<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.750> resized<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
camera to pick up anyways it resized the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.110 
camera to pick up anyways it resized the
image<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.430> now<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
image and what you see now is the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.479 
image and what you see now is the
resized<00:02:43.810> image<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.920> might<00:02:45.100> think<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
resized image or you might think it

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.580 
resized image or you might think it
looks<00:02:45.700> exactly<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.420> same<00:02:46.660> but<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.140> actually

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
looks exactly the same but it's actually

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.070 
looks exactly the same but it's actually
half<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.730> resolution<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> probably

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
half the resolution and it's probably

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.820 
half the resolution and it's probably
pretty<00:02:50.380> hard<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:51.360> demonstrate<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.569> on<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.620> my

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
pretty hard to demonstrate that on on my

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.670 
pretty hard to demonstrate that on on my
camera<00:02:54.220> especially<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:55.000> YouTube<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.080> let's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
camera especially on YouTube so let's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.160 
camera especially on YouTube so let's
make<00:02:56.950> one<00:02:56.980> that's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> little<00:02:57.700> more<00:02:57.850> obvious

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
make one that's a little more obvious

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.650 
make one that's a little more obvious
resize<00:02:59.370> let's<00:03:00.370> set<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.590> don't<00:03:02.590> know

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
resize let's set it to like I don't know

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.930 
resize let's set it to like I don't know
16<00:03:05.670> resize<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:08.730> obviously<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
16 resize so now obviously the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.240 
16 resize so now obviously the
resolution<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:10.720> terrible<00:03:11.170> it's<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.739> 16

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
resolution is terrible it's just like 16

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.970 
resolution is terrible it's just like 16
pixels<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.870> kind<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.140> scale<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.590> down<00:03:14.620> and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
pixels you can kind of scale it down and

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.300 
pixels you can kind of scale it down and
see<00:03:15.220> what<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.580> might<00:03:15.850> look<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
see what it might look like on the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.220 
see what it might look like on the
miniature<00:03:18.760> device<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.450> would<00:03:19.600> be<00:03:19.750> viewing

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
miniature device you would be viewing

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.860 
miniature device you would be viewing
such<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> tiny<00:03:20.829> photos<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.700> don't<00:03:22.299> know

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
such a tiny photos I don't know

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.240 
such a tiny photos I don't know
so<00:03:23.579> now<00:03:24.579> let's<00:03:24.820> show<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.410> quick<00:03:26.410> resize<00:03:26.859> this

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
so now let's show you quick resize this

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.250 
so now let's show you quick resize this
is<00:03:27.459> really<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> big<00:03:28.180> feature<00:03:28.450> no<00:03:28.810> other<00:03:29.019> app

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
is really the big feature no other app

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.110 
is really the big feature no other app
does<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.730> see<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:33.940> similar<00:03:34.680> window

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
does this so you see a similar window

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.319 
does this so you see a similar window
but<00:03:37.380> there's<00:03:38.380> some<00:03:38.680> slight<00:03:39.280> differences<00:03:39.910> here

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
but there's some slight differences here

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.740 
but there's some slight differences here
so<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:40.989> maintain<00:03:41.500> aspect<00:03:41.709> ratio<00:03:42.750> notice

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
so this maintain aspect ratio notice

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.630 
so this maintain aspect ratio notice
there's<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.989> little<00:03:44.079> little<00:03:45.040> star<00:03:45.310> here<00:03:45.579> it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
there's a little little star here it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.490 
there's a little little star here it
says<00:03:45.820> when<00:03:46.030> turned<00:03:46.329> on<00:03:46.450> will<00:03:46.720> do<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.959> best-fit

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
says when turned on will do a best-fit

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.449 
says when turned on will do a best-fit
so<00:03:48.690> basically<00:03:49.690> when<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:49.989> turn<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.680> it'll

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
so basically when you turn this on it'll

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.150 
so basically when you turn this on it'll
kind<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.700> look<00:03:51.910> at<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.150> photo<00:03:52.769> say<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.829> set

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
kind of look at the photo say you set

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.150 
kind of look at the photo say you set
everything<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.640> 640<00:03:55.329> by<00:03:55.510> 480<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.620> if<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.890> photo

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
everything to 640 by 480 so if the photo

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.479 
everything to 640 by 480 so if the photo
is<00:03:57.310> actually<00:03:57.549> more<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.150> vertical<00:03:58.390> photo

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
is actually more of a vertical photo

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.140 
is actually more of a vertical photo
it'll<00:04:00.489> resize<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.940> vertical

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
it'll resize it as if it's a vertical

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
it'll resize it as if it's a vertical
photo<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.519> doesn't<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:08.049> know

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
photo so it doesn't just you know

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.160 
photo so it doesn't just you know
distort<00:04:08.769> your<00:04:08.829> photo<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.370> fit<00:04:09.700> 640<00:04:10.420> by<00:04:10.569> 40<00:04:11.049> it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
distort your photo to fit 640 by 40 it

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.280 
distort your photo to fit 640 by 40 it
actually<00:04:11.590> would<00:04:11.739> make<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:12.069> 640<00:04:12.609> by<00:04:12.790> 480<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.900> its

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
actually would make it 640 by 480 on its

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.170 
actually would make it 640 by 480 on its
side<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:17.470> also<00:04:17.650> does<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.639> aspect<00:04:19.090> ratio

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
side and it also does the aspect ratio

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.260 
side and it also does the aspect ratio
thing<00:04:19.930> where<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.380> keeps<00:04:20.609> like<00:04:21.609> if<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.909> put<00:04:22.120> in

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
thing where it keeps like if you put in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.020 
thing where it keeps like if you put in
some<00:04:22.510> weird<00:04:22.720> resolution<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:23.620> gonna

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
some weird resolution it's gonna

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.590 
some weird resolution it's gonna
basically<00:04:25.030> going<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.539> fit<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.169> best

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
basically going to fit it the best

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.480 
basically going to fit it the best
can<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:27.050> that<00:04:27.200> resolution<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.040> let's<00:04:28.220> just

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
can to that resolution so let's just

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.640 
can to that resolution so let's just
leave<00:04:28.730> on<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.210> default<00:04:29.690> settings<00:04:30.410> here

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
leave on the default settings here

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.610 
leave on the default settings here
commit<00:04:31.040> changes<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.840> you'll<00:04:33.080> see<00:04:33.350> once

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
commit changes and you'll see once

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.860
