need to go in there just the tip and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.830 
need to go in there just the tip and
kind<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.850> side<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.330> thumb<00:04:34.540> and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
make sure it's always bent so the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.030

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
to get really stiff you know that's when

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.860 
to get really stiff you know that's when
the<00:05:27.280> pinky<00:05:27.550> goes<00:05:27.730> straight<00:05:28.030> when<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.420> can<00:05:28.810> do

keep our hand relaxed so this is

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.960 
keep our hand relaxed so this is
something<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.260> need<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.440> practice<00:05:44.980> every<00:05:45.730> day

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
down the road it really has everything

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.160 
down the road it really has everything
to<00:05:57.970> do<00:05:58.120> with<00:05:58.150> how<00:05:58.420> good<00:05:58.480> you're<00:05:58.780> gonna<00:05:58.870> sound

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 
don't touch the part that you use to

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.439 
don't touch the part that you use to
rosin<00:07:20.460> your<00:07:20.550> bow<00:07:20.669> with<00:07:20.879> and<00:07:21.120> you<00:07:21.180> don't<00:07:21.330> want

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:21.449 
rosin your bow with and you don't want

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.320 
rosin your bow with and you don't want
to<00:07:21.509> get<00:07:21.629> any<00:07:21.870> dirt<00:07:22.620> or<00:07:22.860> oils<00:07:23.189> on<00:07:23.789> that<00:07:24.180> either

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
to get any dirt or oils on that either

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.839 
to get any dirt or oils on that either
so<00:07:25.080> be<00:07:25.620> careful<00:07:25.949> with<00:07:26.039> that<00:07:26.099> stuff<00:07:26.219> so<00:07:26.729> that

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
so be careful with that stuff so that

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:29.029 
so be careful with that stuff so that
you<00:07:26.909> keep<00:07:27.059> it<00:07:27.210> nice<00:07:27.360> and<00:07:27.389> clean<00:07:27.779> so<00:07:28.770> that<00:07:28.800> you

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 
you keep it nice and clean so that you

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:30.230 
you keep it nice and clean so that you
can<00:07:29.159> sound<00:07:29.430> good

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
can sound good

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.089 
can sound good
so<00:07:30.689> I<00:07:30.719> think<00:07:30.870> that<00:07:31.139> is<00:07:31.319> everything<00:07:31.620> now<00:07:31.919> for

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
so I think that is everything now for

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.700 
so I think that is everything now for
the<00:07:32.189> first<00:07:32.339> lesson<00:07:32.689> in<00:07:33.689> lesson<00:07:34.020> 2<00:07:34.169> we'll<00:07:34.439> start

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
the first lesson in lesson 2 we'll start

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.149 
the first lesson in lesson 2 we'll start
playing

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:35.159 
playing

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:37.819 
playing
I'll<00:07:35.339> see<00:07:35.520> you<00:07:35.639> then
