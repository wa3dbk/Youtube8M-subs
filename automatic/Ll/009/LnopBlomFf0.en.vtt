00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone the end of the world is coming 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.470
 as you can see we have here that 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.870
 we have here the largest rubik cube 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.030
 of the known universe a cube of 18 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.930
 centimeters let's see 18 centimeters 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.030
 it is very much so little that you think it is not 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.390
 we know 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.030
 I have a three by three here and I do not 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 would have to see the position in which 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.340
 I'm recording is not the most absurd thing about 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.770
 world 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 well here we have a cube a moyÃºa or 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.810
 long and it is worth it since you see is like a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.210
 square so simple no 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.610
 quite impressive we leave it for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.740
 here good what's wrong with this cube kingdom 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.990
 here the hand what occupies to see this 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.700
 cube you have to have them the collection is 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.560
 that is so it is not a cube three by three 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.770
 huge lifetime classics to whom 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.770
 he does not like that and it will be better than 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 I was waiting, I had doubts, I said the same 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.610
 it's a bit like a potato and it turns 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 pretty bad and do not spin it turns well 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.050
 evils can be solved in a couple of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 minutes or less it without problem 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.970
 made to see it is uncomfortable to solve it but 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 not because I turn badly but because they do not have 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.600
 the hands is not quite obvious no 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.860
 because I want to make a layer and not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.170
 you can do so then you have to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 to turn but as it was is a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 kind of wheel tour so this is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.500
 awesome the truth I'm very 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.290
 happy with this cube like someone 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.100
 because you already know what 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.350
 People like to do things 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.540
 purchase 6 disassemble makes one version 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.220
 of each color and then you put stickers 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.090
 it's not an option but to me of course 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.170
 I like it that way, I like it a lot more 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.730
 stickers and that's how big I love the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 true here you can see an edge and 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.720
 let's see what kind of joke this is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.979
 It is the most grotesque edge of the universe 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.010
 we are not going to compare it with a cube of 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.570
 normal rubik you see not an edge with a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.150
 rubik's cube is that this is 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.740
 awesome you do not see that and as I said 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.140
 before you see that it can be separated not by 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.670
 I said that surely someone would buy 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.290
 and make a version of each color 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.990
 and it comes very lubricated, that's fine 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.820
 you see, not here, you can be good, you can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 see more or less 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.930
 a very very interesting design the truth 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.270
 you see that it is completely hollow not 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.220
 because you imagine if it was filled 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.380
 apart from that it would be much more expensive 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.670
 it would greatly lend the cube the corner 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.320
 as it could not be otherwise also 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.540
 it's awesome you do not have these here 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.530
 three colors so funny here the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.860
 union that caught my attention 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 let's see it you see not how it joins seems 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.340
 like a gate not of a ship 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.950
 space is here is here 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.319
 it's around here I like it a lot 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 and obviously it's also huge is not that 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.450
 it's clear let's see how the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.970
 corner and the view how they are when 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.190
 we join them where is the edge here 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.150
 it's good I do not know what he's going to do 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.209
 been unite well and good as it is to see 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.670
 by God concentrate good you see like this 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.170
 would be the union the corner more skimming 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.120
 around here when the typical mechanism does not 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.549
 from a rubik cube three times three but 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.379
 I love these pieces and I already 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.209
 complete here you can see the core of the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.480
 not impressive cube let's get ourselves 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.459
 inside the cube we are completely going to 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.110
 see here is the core the good core 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.760
 awesome we can not see the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.380
 you see that it is completely 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.130
 hollow not all the pieces out there giving 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.110
 turns 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.880
 incredible does not exist breaks this core 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.530
 you are going to have problems I see to find 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.310
 a spare but well this is 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.930
 awesome let's try 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.940
 mess it up and so we see how it is not 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.050
 let's do a few turns for 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.520
 here by here as I said before is not that 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.260
 manual turn the problem is that they do not have 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.670
 the hands just good and neither 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.620
 has cut corners is worth cutting 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.290
 corner is shining by its absence we go 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.960
 to see a small gap and you see that no 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.120
 it does not adapt no but good to see either 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.040
 you're going to need it is not that you're not going to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.770
 make quick turns in this cube at 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.410
 end you have to square it like this from time 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.420
 on when making a turn around here another 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.310
 I turn around here and good to see how it 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.750
 It melts quickly not because either is 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.850
 no problem not because you already know that 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.310
 with a do about 20 spins is already 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.240
 completely undone the cube this cube 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.319
 that as you know as you know 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.939
 perfect to throw at your head 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.949
 to throw it at the head of those 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.720
 people you can not see in front of you 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.829
 there is no doubt some good we are going to 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.829
 speed up a little process 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.940
 this is how it is completely undone 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.740
 you imagine an even bigger 4x4 or 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.860
 I know a lot in the future 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.250
 completely decadent takes to the market 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.710
 a huge 7 by 7 huge the size of 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.090
 a person me that I know you never know no 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.680
 but what would be good would be a 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.630
 pyramid for example not that it is a design 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.819
 also very traditional because of this 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.349
 size I do not think would be perfect 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.690
 whatever it is, I say goodbye here with this 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.400
 fantastic exotic edition so not me 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.110
 love these beige cubes and the cube 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.880
 The poor thing is that he could not be in 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.919
 another place not and here that one knee 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.690
 because you get limbs from the 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.750
 good screen I hope you have 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.440
 liked the video as always and we 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.440
 we see in another
