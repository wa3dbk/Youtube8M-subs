go to private school is supposed to
public<00:02:38.500> school<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.340> that's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
public school and I think that that's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.310 
public school and I think that that's
back

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.630 

what<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.440> private<00:02:47.590> side<00:02:47.860> saying<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.460> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
what the private side saying is that you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.240 
what the private side saying is that you
know<00:02:48.730> after<00:02:48.820> prop<00:02:49.180> 13<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.290> there's<00:02:50.800> no<00:02:50.980> more

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
