00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 to 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.780
 your attention submitted 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.139
 honda motor pump 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.359
 model called pick 30 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.119
 here we ask us 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 This is one of the most popular motor pumps. 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 designed for pumping 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.740
 clean water from their bit of cops six 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.289
 millimeters 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.339
 on four 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.100
 the characteristics of this motor pump 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.100
 can see here 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.480
 that is 80 millimeters from 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.970
 pipe 1100 liters per minute 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.600
 performance 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.820
 what is 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 66 cubes per hour 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.730
 mean in short about this model 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.090
 does it mean because we have 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.590
 works 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.500
 engines 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.680
 four stroke gasoline 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500
 engine oil we fill in separate 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.260
 engine map 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.170
 here i'm showing 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 filler neck 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 clean fuel gasoline score photo report 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.509
 it means this model is going to be our daily 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.630
 starting 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.540
 right to sell 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.010
 plant slates 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.850
 the extent I get and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 position he 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.630
 livia turn 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.850
 we go 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 and the top is the air damper 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 here is the icon shown 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.400
 a little lower this experience is a slave 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.940
 that is, at the factory 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 position from as shown 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.900
 as 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.330
 right extreme right position so as 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.350
 pellets 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.760
 and according to the director we start 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 close the aircraft 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 but how to deliver we replenish the floor 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.569
 We need 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.569
 fill the shelf with impeller water 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.019
 god is 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.949
 she says 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.439
 Here are the vessels we fill them with year 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.639
 respectively 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.399
 before that installed all pairs of plugs 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.719
 that is, we have a day off 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.909
 catch one sleeveless 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.859
 components 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.129
 installed all sleeves 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.339
 oil, respectively, already poured 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.019
 if all other people just 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.799
 but it does not start why 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.729
 because 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.009
 present here 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.609
 level sensor 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.609
 bridge over here here 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.659
 gasoline poured 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.659
 closed the table on air 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.299
 except this item 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.519
 why did the starter handle feel reproached with 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.969
 the same day starts 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.479
 that is, a light movement starts 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.089
 station 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 correct motor pump then 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.929
 as the engine warms up, open 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.889
 state aid cop 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.519
 except this position 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.039
 until the end of April 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.589
 that is, you feel that 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.549
 promote years running 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.879
 steadily 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.620
 you can already exploit it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.089
 there is 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.599
 but also the regulator 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.409
 engine speed complies 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.309
 performance can regulate 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.899
 less - more 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.439
 that is, the position of the bunny is big 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.079
 big turtle turnovers less 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.569
 turnover less productivity 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.309
 besides to stop 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.389
 motor pump is enough 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.069
 just turn it off 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 percentage of ignition position 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.119
 well what else can we note means 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.489
 here we are present 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.989
 air filter 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.989
 there are listeners on this side 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.079
 it opens when working therefore it is necessary 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.929
 be careful not to burn yourself 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.159
 Well here we see even 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.159
 presented bags 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.599
 a warning 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.050
 that's all 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 motor pump review 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.849
 I finished
