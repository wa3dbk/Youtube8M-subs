you how you can get money easy on 403
today<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.500> yeah

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.130 

three<00:00:28.740> day<00:00:28.860> would<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.310> straight<00:00:29.640> from

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
three day would just go straight from

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.840 
three day would just go straight from
the<00:00:31.140> main<00:00:31.350> main<00:00:32.070> meaning<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> could

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the main main meaning that way I could

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.170 
the main main meaning that way I could
show<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.330> it<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.370> need<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
show you what it go you will need the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.530 
show you what it go you will need the
benchmark<00:00:36.989> maps<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.190> may<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.270> those

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
benchmark maps you may have got those

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.680 
benchmark maps you may have got those
whenever<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> bought<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.620> game<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.510> just

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
whenever you bought the game you just

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
whenever you bought the game you just
have<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> enter<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> code<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.650> you<00:00:43.920> should

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
have to enter the code and you should

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
have to enter the code and you should
have<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> maps<00:00:46.040> so<00:00:47.210> basically<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.449> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
have the maps so basically what you have

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
have the maps so basically what you have
to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.500> ahead<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:49.769> load<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:55.550> sorry<00:00:56.550> it's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
to do go ahead and load up sorry it's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.280 
to do go ahead and load up sorry it's
taken<00:00:57.030> forever<00:00:57.150> go<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.809> over<00:01:01.260> here

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and just go to private race and here's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.450 
and just go to private race and here's
what<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> set<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.979> go<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.190> game

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
what you would want to set up go to game

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
what you would want to set up go to game
setup<00:01:15.380> environment

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 

however<00:01:28.650> many<00:01:28.800> laps<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.550> on<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.120> gonna

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
however many laps you want on I'm gonna

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.860 
however many laps you want on I'm gonna
do<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.750> either<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.590> 50<00:01:32.040> usually<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.880> put

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
do like either about 50 usually I put

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.310 
do like either about 50 usually I put
this<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.200> simulation<00:01:35.600> if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this on simulation if you are going to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.250 
this on simulation if you are going to
be<00:01:37.440> doing<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.120> simulation<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:39.990> put

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
be doing that on simulation you can put

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.960 
be doing that on simulation you can put
the<00:01:40.380> end<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.620> race<00:01:40.710> timer<00:01:40.980> down<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.580> like<00:01:41.730> five

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the end of race timer down to like five

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
the end of race timer down to like five
just<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.630> easier<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:43.380> wait<00:01:43.560> as

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
just make it easier if you don't wait as

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.500 
just make it easier if you don't wait as
long<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:44.940> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.120> be<00:01:45.210> doing<00:01:45.300> it

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
long but if you're going to be doing it

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.800 
long but if you're going to be doing it
on<00:01:45.570> simulation<00:01:46.490> make<00:01:47.490> sure<00:01:47.730> not<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.330> any

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on simulation make sure not that any

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.150 
on simulation make sure not that any
walls<00:01:49.080> because<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.800> will<00:01:49.830> take

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
walls because if you do it will take

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.570 
walls because if you do it will take
money<00:01:50.400> away<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:52.410> then<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.490> know

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
money away from you and then you know

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.220 
money away from you and then you know
there's<00:01:53.730> all<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.180> AI<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.690> stuff<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> then

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
there's all your AI and stuff and then

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.940 
there's all your AI and stuff and then
go<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> select<00:01:55.950> car<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:57.590> would<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.770> recommend

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
go to select car I would just recommend

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
go to select car I would just recommend
picking<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.670> car<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.300> has<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.900> know<00:02:01.020> pretty

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
picking a car that has you know pretty

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.070 
picking a car that has you know pretty
good<00:02:01.410> handling<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> decent<00:02:02.640> speed<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.270> tried

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
good handling and decent speed I tried

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.010 
good handling and decent speed I tried
my<00:02:04.290> bugatti<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.850> didn't<00:02:06.510> work<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.840> I'll

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
my bugatti and it didn't work so I'll

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900 
my bugatti and it didn't work so I'll
cuz<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> didn't<00:02:07.470> handle<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.890> well<00:02:08.040> so<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
cuz I didn't handle so well so I just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.210 
cuz I didn't handle so well so I just
been<00:02:09.060> picking<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.479> car<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.320> what<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
been picking this car see what it is you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.760 
been picking this car see what it is you
know<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:15.360> use<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.930> these<00:02:16.590> are<00:02:16.740> my

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
know I just use that one these are my

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
know I just use that one these are my
assist<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.580> could<00:02:17.760> probably<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.209> pay

then<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.590> star<00:02:26.250> race<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.260> wait<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
then go to star race and wait for this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:39.199 
then go to star race and wait for this
amazingly<00:02:29.040> long<00:02:29.370> thing<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.910> countdown

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.580 

and<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:41.020> on<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.370> 50-lap<00:02:42.790> one<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.540> could<00:02:44.319> get

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and on on the 50-lap one I could get

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.040 
and on on the 50-lap one I could get
about<00:02:44.890> 50<00:02:45.310> laps<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.940> car<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.330> about<00:02:46.420> 18

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
about 50 laps in this car in about 18

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.420 
about 50 laps in this car in about 18
minutes<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.769> mean<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.129> will<00:02:48.250> show<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
minutes so I mean that will show you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.369
