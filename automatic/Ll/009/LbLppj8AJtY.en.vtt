00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
results yeah it's pretty even on each

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
results yeah it's pretty even on each
side<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:15.550> kind<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.910> what<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.150> want

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870

okay<00:03:19.560> step<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:20.670> we're<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.360> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
okay step now we're going to do this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.900 
okay step now we're going to do this
side<00:03:24.319> so<00:03:25.910> put<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.620> camera<00:03:28.620> down<00:03:28.790> we're<00:03:29.790> going

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
side so put the camera down we're going

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.080 
side so put the camera down we're going
to<00:03:29.970> take<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.480> corner<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:32.550> you're<00:03:32.790> going<00:03:33.030> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
to take this corner and you're going to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:51.470 
to take this corner and you're going to
fold<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:34.129> inward<00:03:36.739> like<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:41.690> hold<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.840> set

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.570 

like<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.129> take<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.670> tape

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.560 

so<00:04:00.480> if<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.810> taking<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.140> long<00:04:01.260> time<00:04:01.320> okay<00:04:02.100> a

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
so if this is taking a long time okay a

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.850 
so if this is taking a long time okay a
real<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.690> doesn't<00:04:03.780> take<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.110> long<00:04:04.350> time<00:04:04.530> but

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
real that doesn't take a long time but

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.160 
real that doesn't take a long time but
you<00:04:05.850> know<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:06.090> you're<00:04:06.210> not<00:04:06.330> talking<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.870> takes

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you know if you're not talking it takes

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.860 
you know if you're not talking it takes
a<00:04:07.470> lot<00:04:07.740> easier<00:04:08.160> time<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.580> until<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.720> like

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
a lot easier time so until it's like

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.340 
a lot easier time so until it's like
this<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:11.210> could<00:04:12.210> have<00:04:12.240> cut<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.570> little<00:04:12.840> extra<00:04:13.260> off

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350
