00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hey people, you say here and today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.390
 Let's try a black ops 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
 electrical record I am first 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
 the deathmatch 23 players around first 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
 so I can enter only once 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.299
 with the typical sports freaks afterwards 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.859
 plays with no idea blackbird and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.279
 counter baby let's see how we still 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.750
 to change 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.859
 in different now first team 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.270
 Deathmatch so I first 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.130
 I can not find myself either 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.699
 prepared or no warm-up rounds 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.070
 made okay but no running 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.920
 game is good 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.190
 I was actually for meltdown though 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:45.020
 looks bad 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 let's see how it would be at all 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.649
 Yes, sometimes it will be wise 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:58.620
 usually only ever choose three 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:03.989
 then take people pro lobby express yes then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.369
 we express it first de 1 1 490 is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.549
 for me not such a sms email because 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.439
 There are also many long range 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 so take place all the elevations 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.090
 one can well the sniper yet 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:24.270
 somehow try to defeat with 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 doubt and i'm out perfect you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.540
 but I am very good for everyone 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.299
 everything by yes i want good house okay we 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.140
 go around like that 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 usually comes a long but 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.630
 is at live contest actually runs 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.659
 always everything different than planned 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 This time for the first time there 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.890
 a perfect start i run better 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.590
 can 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.950
 taken control racing wars are there 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.890
 he dares to go in a lot more 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.119

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.540
 ball am an opponent ok opponent could 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.239
 on the other side again now 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.510

 I also notice you are still one 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.040
 someone is standing 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:35.390
 we have very fancy wait 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.390
 damn funny comic there is someone 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.640
 by said bush catch to a 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.380
 Maybe you know that me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.540
 I do not have a silencer 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.930
 cope 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.260
 where god oh god that was more than close 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.810
 had just survive until the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 but well I'm so happy with that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.920
 aktrice moved autocratic and mean 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.079
 Lending station we have contact happy 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.079
 That's exactly what I'm always talking about 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.120
 The king is so wonderful 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.209
 that's explained by jawoll 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.940
 okay okay so far everything is going on like this 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.280
 SchnÃ¼rchen thought so right after that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.600
 start at where as the driver killed me 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 I thought that can not be anything 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.359
 but now it seems to be here too 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.079
 be there and look and pick up express 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:40.819
 that's always such a thing 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:43.590
 well, of course, more than satisfied 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.519
 already two titles in one intuitive 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.690
 people are not bad but now 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.079
 It's a bit quiet here 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.900
 has returned 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.900
 where are the opponents only 100 meters 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.970
 okay good that he is uploaded directly 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.050
 times would like the people therefore 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.500
 I still think that here against 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.320
 would have to be a very 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:20.019
 Of course I do not have over it 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.019
 Thinking about a game with one 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.110
 properly in the game there and it is 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:35.080
 more luck than understood not 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.080
 from the state just made how high 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.169
 that's the one with the zipped your schopka in 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.740
 hand would go on the topic so 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.740
 do 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.500
 here's left shoots quickly can 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.500
 the user of the victim is still someone 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.300
 lived there to pick up someone from here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.789
 Now everyone can change up there 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:16.960
 rather on the devil me a bit 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:19.120
 walk faster again with the friend 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.430
 Led is another one has two people 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.430
 this fucking part of it and simple 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:38.560
 rosetta stone 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:41.320
 Well, I'm okay opponents are back there 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.910
 the area is just watch out for that 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.270
 not again somewhere one is still sitting 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.750
 waiting for me people like to do 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.880
 Of course, he still sits god and the 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:58.680
 world is dead 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:02.070
 okay still no one I hear again 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.070
 now deleted 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.199
 that was just the scarcity I now 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.550
 not even waiting for me 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.570
 but I obviously can not get out 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.070
 the hip even if the opponent directly 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:23.370
 his fire ag was prepared in front of me 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.370
 maybe should do but no matter 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:37.879
 until suddenly lamp express it 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:43.490
 the types the assholes play for 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:44.839
 which many speak of where that 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.979
 is difficult to look at two though 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.569
 at all steps then can they 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.939
 never really globalize like that 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.879
 the three we knew exactly did the over 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:55.159
 play like this under or a year ago 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:58.300
 that a bit more difficult and 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.300
 namely now killed again 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:08.259
 This time fear as white neumann the 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:10.370
 but once again contrary camera 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:15.199
 maybe rockin 'my music again 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.849
 scores trix and flix plate is one 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:21.680
 real idiot until now not yet 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:22.729
 once again i felt like again 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.509
 even this time did not make it 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.990
 ok 26 5 because I was a very passable 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.969
 begin 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.430
 I thank Peter for watching please 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:39.110
