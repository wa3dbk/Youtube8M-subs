another kill on the skeleton key using

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.950 
another kill on the skeleton key using
the<00:01:11.729> rapid<00:01:12.210> fire<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> we'll<00:01:13.049> compare<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.890> two

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
the rapid fire and we'll compare the two

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
the rapid fire and we'll compare the two
depending<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> rapid<00:01:17.820> fire<00:01:18.030> vs

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
depending on the you know rapid fire vs

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.590 
depending on the you know rapid fire vs
e<00:01:18.950> inhale

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
e inhale

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
e inhale
frenzy<00:01:22.409> will<00:01:22.560> last<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> long<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> don't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
frenzy will last for that long so don't

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
frenzy will last for that long so don't
worry<00:01:24.119> about<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:26.150> i<00:01:27.150> found<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.229> impale

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
worry about that i found that impale

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.020 
worry about that i found that impale
actually<00:01:29.430> works<00:01:29.640> better<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.600> grits<00:01:30.900> much

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
actually works better if it grits much

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
actually works better if it grits much
like<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.210> sometimes<00:01:33.750> last<00:01:33.990> time<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:36.380> rapid

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like all sometimes last time but rapid

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.399 
like all sometimes last time but rapid
fire<00:01:37.560> every<00:01:37.950> single<00:01:38.369> hit<00:01:38.549> Chris<00:01:39.170> which<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
fire every single hit Chris which is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.490 
fire every single hit Chris which is
pretty<00:01:40.830> unlikely<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.210> every<00:01:42.539> single<00:01:42.960> hit

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pretty unlikely but if every single hit

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.889 
pretty unlikely but if every single hit
criticals<00:01:44.130> maybe<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.789> it'll<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.270> faster

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
criticals maybe you know it'll be faster

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.940 
criticals maybe you know it'll be faster
so<00:01:46.460> let's<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.570> fast<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> kill

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so let's see just how fast I can kill

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:11.210 
so let's see just how fast I can kill
the<00:01:50.070> Skeleton<00:01:50.460> King<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.820> time
