00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.029
 the cytoskeleton is actually 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.090
 the assembly of multiple proteins 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.560
 between them to form a kind 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.320
 frame to the cell that goes especially 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.770
 give it its shape with that of the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.500
 membrane but unlike the framework 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.660
 of our organization 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.440
 these protein assemblies are 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 unstable 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.489
 they can change in time there 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.649
 may have assembly periods 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.270
 very quickly followed two periods of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.129
 protein separation from them 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.850
 so we have extremely phenomena 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.039
 dynamic 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.129
 throughout the life of the cell one 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.609
 distinguishes three families of proteins 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.980
 forming filaments form in itself 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.839
 the whole cytoskeleton there are the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.079
 micros filaments or actin filaments 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.810
 which are the finer there are the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.600
 microtubules that are the thickest and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.659
 the intermediate filaments the set 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.940
 of these filaments may be present in 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.890
 the whole cell as well to 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.780
 inside the kernel only in the site 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
 in places or under the membrane 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.860
 cell the cytoskeleton to several 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.960
 roles 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.290
 firstly so it gives shape to the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.870
 cell but it also ensures 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.430
 transport functions like rails to 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.260
 the inside of the cell on which 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.050
 the different intracellular elements 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 will be able to move is also the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.910
 cytoskeleton that is responsible for 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.000
 movements of the cell on a support 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.430
 or muscle contraction and the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.270
 cytoskeleton is also important for 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.980
 the transfer of arn messenger to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.470
 inside the nucleus to the cytoplasm 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.290
 and for enzymatic activity and 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.150
 metabolic of the cell the filaments 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.460
 intermediaries are the filaments the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.300
 more stable cell and also the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.170
 more rigid 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.119
 we find them around the nucleus at 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 inside the nucleus and so on these 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.459
 intermediate filaments that condenses and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.980
 chromatin and dna and we find 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.220
 in the site to the places in network and 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.780
 under the membrane of the cell there is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.120
 different types of filaments 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.810
 intermediate depending on the type 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.510
 cellular 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.000
 it's important information because 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 that she signs ans 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 somehow the cell origin and of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.170
 which organ comes this cell and that's 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.210
 information that is used 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.400
 especially when we have cells 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.000
 cancerous to know the origin of 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 this cancer 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.340
 we can look for the type of filaments 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.160
 intermediate present in this cell 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 cancerous who will give us the point 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 starting from this cancer giving us 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.250
 a lung cell signature of the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.730
 liver of the prostate or the system 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 central nervous
