00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.830 
look at what I think are the top 5 n64
first-person<00:00:24.119> shooters

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
first-person shooters

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
first-person shooters
number<00:00:25.410> 5<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> really<00:00:26.189> tough<00:00:26.400> choice

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
number 5 was a really tough choice

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
number 5 was a really tough choice
between<00:00:27.000> doom<00:00:27.480> 64<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> game<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> I

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
between doom 64 and the game that I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
between doom 64 and the game that I
eventually<00:00:29.220> chose<00:00:29.640> beam<00:00:30.630> 64<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> really

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
eventually chose beam 64 is a really

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
eventually chose beam 64 is a really
great<00:00:31.769> first-person<00:00:32.520> shooter<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> definitely

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
great first-person shooter is definitely

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.080 
great first-person shooter is definitely
underrated<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> n64<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> decided<00:00:35.850> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
underrated on the n64 but I decided to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.280 
underrated on the n64 but I decided to
fifth<00:00:36.480> place<00:00:36.719> I'd<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.559> Duke<00:00:38.370> Nukem<00:00:38.610> 64<00:00:39.420> now

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
fifth place I'd go for Duke Nukem 64 now

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.450 
fifth place I'd go for Duke Nukem 64 now
this<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.710> game<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.129> pretty<00:00:41.370> much

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this is one game which pretty much

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
this is one game which pretty much
everybody's<00:00:42.000> played<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.570> you've<00:00:42.660> probably

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
everybody's played and you've probably

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
everybody's played and you've probably
played<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> PC<00:00:43.890> before<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.340> played

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
played it on the PC before you played

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.240 
played it on the PC before you played
this<00:00:44.820> port<00:00:45.180> over<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> n64<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:47.070> whilst

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this port over on the n64 and whilst

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
this port over on the n64 and whilst
it's<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> best<00:00:47.910> graphically<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> has

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's not the best graphically and has

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's not the best graphically and has
got<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.920> character<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> game

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
got a lot of character to the game

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.150 
got a lot of character to the game
there's<00:00:51.120> lots<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.390> secret<00:00:52.110> areas<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> find<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there's lots of secret areas to find and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.610 
there's lots of secret areas to find and
I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> controls<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.170> dialogue

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I think that the controls the dialogue

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860 
I think that the controls the dialogue
the<00:00:55.739> story<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.699> quite<00:00:57.000> fun<00:00:57.270> games<00:00:57.539> not

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the story it's all quite fun games not

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
the story it's all quite fun games not
to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.020> taken<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.590> seriously<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.550> actually

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to be taken too seriously but actually

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
to be taken too seriously but actually
has<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.120> quite<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> challenge<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
has got quite a bit of challenge in it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
has got quite a bit of challenge in it
as<00:01:01.469> well<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.219> why<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> didn't<00:01:02.760> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
as well that's why it didn't really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
as well that's why it didn't really
finished<00:01:03.329> too<00:01:03.539> high<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.989> list<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
finished too high on my list because it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.920 
finished too high on my list because it
was<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> port<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.400> PC<00:01:05.850> game<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> by<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
was a port of a PC game and by that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
was a port of a PC game and by that
point<00:01:07.200> even<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> PC<00:01:07.890> game<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.250> already<00:01:08.400> out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
point even the PC game was already out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
point even the PC game was already out
of<00:01:08.610> date<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:09.840> nevertheless<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of date but it is still nevertheless a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
of date but it is still nevertheless a
fun<00:01:10.710> game<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> play<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> fourth<00:01:12.240> place<00:01:12.540> we're

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
fun game to play in a fourth place we're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859 
fun game to play in a fourth place we're
gonna<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.560> Perfect<00:01:14.430> Dark<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:15.570> probably

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
gonna go with Perfect Dark now probably

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
gonna go with Perfect Dark now probably
a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.500> thinking<00:01:16.950> why<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
a lot of you all at thinking why is this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
a lot of you all at thinking why is this
not<00:01:17.850> high<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> list<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> honest

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
not high up on the list and to be honest

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
not high up on the list and to be honest
it<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.460> good<00:01:20.640> game<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it is a really good game and a lot of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
it is a really good game and a lot of
people<00:01:21.780> obviously<00:01:22.049> were<00:01:22.350> expecting<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
people obviously were expecting the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.600 
people obviously were expecting the
goldeneye<00:01:23.490> 2<00:01:24.590> then<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.920> wasn't<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
goldeneye 2 then it wasn't you know so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.890 
goldeneye 2 then it wasn't you know so
quite<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.030> good<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.750> didn't

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
quite as good as that and it didn't

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
quite as good as that and it didn't
really<00:01:27.960> reach<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> heights<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.890> gold<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really reach the heights that gold and I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
really reach the heights that gold and I
reached<00:01:29.670> despite<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> fact<00:01:30.509> graphically

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
reached despite the fact graphically

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.460 
reached despite the fact graphically
technically<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.340> stronger<00:01:33.119> game<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
technically is a much stronger game the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.780 
technically is a much stronger game the
reason<00:01:34.710> why<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.860> wasn't<00:01:35.189> high<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.670> list

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
reason why this wasn't high on the list

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
reason why this wasn't high on the list
for<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:36.900> though<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
for me was because even though it is a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
for me was because even though it is a
great<00:01:37.380> game<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.430> something<00:01:38.579> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
great game it was just something I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
great game it was just something I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
this one's definitely my favorite the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.470 
this one's definitely my favorite the
first<00:02:11.710> one<00:02:11.890> I'm<00:02:12.010> not<00:02:12.130> too<00:02:12.340> keen<00:02:12.610> on<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.060> second

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
first one I'm not too keen on the second

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.990 
first one I'm not too keen on the second
one<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> thought<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:13.930> far<00:02:14.260> too<00:02:14.470> difficult

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
one I thought was far too difficult

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.370 
one I thought was far too difficult
range<00:02:16.000> Wars<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.420> thought<00:02:16.630> was<00:02:16.780> fun<00:02:17.050> but

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
range Wars I thought was fun but

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.780 
range Wars I thought was fun but
compared<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.890> multiplayer<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.640> could

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
compared to multiplayer that you could

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.980 
compared to multiplayer that you could
already<00:02:19.000> get<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.180> Goldeneye

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
already get on Goldeneye

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.300 
already get on Goldeneye
I'm<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.500> well<00:02:20.650> as<00:02:20.709> having<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.980> single-player

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
I'm as well as having a single-player

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.010 
I'm as well as having a single-player
campaign<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:22.030> there<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.420> wasn't<00:02:22.570> quite<00:02:22.780> as

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
campaign on there it wasn't quite as

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.380 
campaign on there it wasn't quite as
good<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> did<00:02:24.430> decide<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.730> go<00:02:24.910> for<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.300> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
good and so I did decide to go for it to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140 
good and so I did decide to go for it to
a<00:02:25.540> three<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.800> becoming<00:02:27.130> quite<00:02:27.820> expensive

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
a three this is becoming quite expensive

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.170 
a three this is becoming quite expensive
to<00:02:28.390> get<00:02:28.510> hold<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.810> especially<00:02:29.200> completing<00:02:29.740> box

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to get hold of especially completing box

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.340 
to get hold of especially completing box
but<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.300> terms<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.600> actual<00:02:31.840> game<00:02:31.900> itself

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
but in terms of the actual game itself

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
but in terms of the actual game itself
I'd<00:02:32.590> say<00:02:32.800> it's<00:02:32.920> probably<00:02:33.220> got<00:02:33.280> some<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.520> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
I'd say it's probably got some of the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.729 
I'd say it's probably got some of the
best<00:02:33.940> graphics<00:02:34.420> from<00:02:34.570> any<00:02:34.840> game<00:02:35.110> on<00:02:35.290> any<00:02:35.470> genre

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
best graphics from any game on any genre

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.590 
best graphics from any game on any genre
on<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.489> n64

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600

on the n64
it<00:02:37.690> doesn't<00:02:37.959> make<00:02:38.020> use<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.470> expansion

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it doesn't make use of the expansion

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.979 
it doesn't make use of the expansion
pack<00:02:39.250> which<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:40.090> know<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.450> does<00:02:40.600> help<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
pack which you know so it does help to

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.170 
pack which you know so it does help to

about the framerate in the game too it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.160 
about the framerate in the game too it
can<00:02:44.860> drop<00:02:45.070> quite<00:02:45.459> slow<00:02:45.790> sometimes<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.989> actual

can drop quite slow sometimes the actual

can drop quite slow sometimes the actual
game<00:02:47.500> itself<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:48.040> really<00:02:48.370> fun<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.760> play<00:02:48.910> it's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510

other turret games in terms of accepting
the<00:02:53.860> storyline<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.430> kind<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.790> sort<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.030> fitting

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the storyline is kind of sort of fitting

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.210 
the storyline is kind of sort of fitting
together<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.440> really<00:02:56.739> great<00:02:56.890> game

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
together but it's a really great game

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.010 
together but it's a really great game
and<00:02:57.370> not<00:02:57.489> too<00:02:57.670> many<00:02:57.760> people<00:02:58.030> actually<00:02:58.300> realize

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
and not too many people actually realize

you're playing the game I found it to be
challenging<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:41.920> not<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> point<00:03:42.579> where

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
challenging but not to the point where

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.759 
challenging but not to the point where
it<00:03:43.090> was<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.870> know<00:03:44.019> sort<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.290> boring<00:03:44.560> and

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
stressing it felt like a fair challenge

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.449 
stressing it felt like a fair challenge
whereas<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> lot<00:03:47.500> of<00:03:47.560> first-person<00:03:47.829> shooters

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
whereas a lot of first-person shooters

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.430 
whereas a lot of first-person shooters
you<00:03:48.610> know<00:03:48.730> fire<00:03:49.480> loads<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.959> different<00:03:50.049> enemies

there's<00:03:52.120> always<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.299> good<00:03:52.510> balance<00:03:52.870> between<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
there's always a good balance between it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.800 
there's always a good balance between it
being<00:03:53.799> just<00:03:53.860> about<00:03:54.420> difficult<00:03:55.420> enough<00:03:55.570> but

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
being just about difficult enough but

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.250 
being just about difficult enough but
being<00:03:56.769> enjoyable<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.610> play<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:59.140> the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
being enjoyable to play I like the

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.620 
being enjoyable to play I like the
graphics<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.209> storyline<00:04:01.209> as<00:04:01.450> you'd

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
graphics in the storyline as you'd

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.020 
graphics in the storyline as you'd
expect

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
expect

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.220 
expect
for<00:04:02.210> credit<00:04:02.660> games<00:04:02.900> pretty<00:04:03.110> much

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
for credit games pretty much

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.410 
for credit games pretty much
non-existent<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:04.520> I<00:04:04.550> think<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.150> you're

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
non-existent but I think that if you're

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.540 
non-existent but I think that if you're
looking<00:04:05.690> for<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.200> really<00:04:06.590> great<00:04:06.680> first-person

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
shooter then this is definitely one that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.290 
shooter then this is definitely one that
you<00:04:09.980> need<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.190> check<00:04:10.340> out<00:04:10.580> okay<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.120> that
