00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350
 ah 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.920
 hello welcome to another very technical and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.780
 with achieve in the title achieves spot worship 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 13 the building as he put it and 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.290
 As you can see we are in a pretty building 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 father but it's not so much a building 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.770
 which is a spot in which we can kill 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 very well in the people ok look if we 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.279
 we found right here as they are well 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 here I was with a subscriber recording 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.580
 to show them how you can serve them and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.050
 come as they see it is such a place 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.239
 a lot of people know him but a lot 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.580
 people who do not and their location is just 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.440
 here in continuation I will let you 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.110
 find right here in this speaking at 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.370
 this spine of the map as you see it is very 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.809
 easy to get and apart the most 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 important is that it is between the zones 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 from home and as you know there's always a lot 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 war through these streets then right now 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 I'm going to show you and it's not just this spot 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.500
 the one that will have also has another that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.840
 is right here but this is the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.030
 best of all in my opinion and they will be able to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.369
 go there and apart they can also 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.200
 go to what the other point is doing 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.759
 that then with what they see here has another 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.259
 which is practically higher but the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.550
 I really do not like it that much, but 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.020
 It will also serve them well, they have not 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.430
 made weapons can get very far 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 if you notice, we are going to take this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.490
 sniper to see more or less 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 how far they arrive and then practically 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 they can kill people from here not and more 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.270
 for those who are very good 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.070
 snipers 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.450
 will serve you quite a bit now I'm going to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.030
 show how they can get to this area 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.920
 so they can not pull from there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.149
 to see how they see it, we landed well 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.159
 close to what the floor is doing 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.020
 almost almost before crashing and we're going 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.990
 direct not to get on top of what we 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.969
 interesting ok to see right now my subscriber 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.920
 is going to win from above what 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.600
 is doing this and is going to let kill 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520
 so they can see how it can serve 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 all this very well although then we go 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.670
 to go us up to see 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 how can you climb practically 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 then let's go to the top of what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.549
 is doing the building that as they see it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.409
 it's not so much a building but it's like 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.849
 a construction platform that 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 truth serves quite well and the truth 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.819
 I do not see much sense in what goes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.020
 doing this platform because 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.209
 practically what this has 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 platform since it's to build or 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.770
 for things like that for workers and things like that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 but look at the success of this is that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.610
 all the buildings that are here just 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.319
 here they are all finished and not 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.269
 they have nothing to do 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.549
 saying it like they see is something difficult to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.810
 climb but it 's worth not 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.060
 frank or throw from up there since 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.220
 the other players will never have 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.329
 asked of one you gave them the bullet and 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.579
 the truth I believe that in a session 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.540
 open well enough not for 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.950
 plus 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.750
 to troll enemies and those who 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.430
 be close as you see it are many 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.109
 turns practically if they do not know how to get there 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 and they're going to say hey there's no more stairs 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.469
 If you call, you have to look for the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.359
 as they see we are almost going to get what 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.010
 you're doing up what 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.719
 towards our platform and look here 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.640
 as they see it once they have arrived 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.840
 this point because they will already be above what 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.290
 that doing the platform here 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.730
 it will simply be for them to have 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.159
 good aim and then nothing to see 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.620
 here to push it to see does not let me 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.150
 push it anything good already commits suicide 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.439
 then right now the benzines like 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.090
 can franco pull very well from here 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.349
 and one thing here if they want to frank 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.970
 throw me jor here what will they have to 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.370
 to do is to pass as purely little 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.480
 this thing practically like that and once 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.579
 that they have arrived here the only thing that 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.109
 will have to do will be going up here and not 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.489
 worry that they will fall not 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.769
 they fall then once they have 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.510
 come here then you can franco pull 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.849
 very well very well in fact that these 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.010
 areas practically for snipers 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.030
 it's not so much to fight against 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.549
 police the truth that looks pretty 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.139
 well and we're going to look for our friend a 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.120
 enemy in case you are not playing 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.530
 against shock friends they are also going 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.269
 to serve very well to troll their 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.769
 friends to see him I do not see him quite well 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.440
 and as you see ladies it 's thing that is 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.240
 look for your friend and come here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.870
 in this we are seeing to see that 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.670
 is still ok then as you see it is 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.380
 a very good this will serve you 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 quite in addition to that also if 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.640
 They want to fight against the police too 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990
 will serve you can throw bombs and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.240
 throw it to your case is what you want and it is 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.830
 thing that you have imagination and 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.330
 do what you want ok they also have 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.700
 that take into account how much is the time 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.310
 of a missile to be able to destroy a car 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.840
 because it is not the same to be one by one 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.850
 very close distance to be a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.050
 very far distance then you 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.340
 tell me in the comments if you want a 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.720
 little bit more of this series to me the truth 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.960
 that then if it costs me work because 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.770
 I have to find more places regarding 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.480
 this 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.950
 or you know it's not so easy then there's 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.180
 places that are very well known for 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.130
 places like this that are not so 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.840
 known then also not then here 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.070
 as they see it they can practically do 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.440
 whatever they want, they can troll their 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.910
 friends can kill random people can 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.710
 do what they want in fact if they want 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.120
 take a separate picture that the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.500
 landscape is quite beautiful we are going to 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.330
 take a picture here in our 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.310
 character to see how beautiful you look 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.530
 said that it has a very nice view and 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.390
 Well, it's something father, then, not like that, take you 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.950
 a picture I do not know in what things you want 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.240
 do looks pretty good then 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.800

 here is in this corner of the map 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.330
 It is practically very easy to get there 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.979
 that is in the area where the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.750
 houses and where is the most purchased house 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.610
 of great affection online ok then here 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.919
 as you can see they can frankly throw very well 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.479
 from that area and then doing the thing 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.250
 that you here can improve your 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.330
 aim apart from those who are very 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.520
 good snipers 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.229
 they can practically improve with their 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.460
