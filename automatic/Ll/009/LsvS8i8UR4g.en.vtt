00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hi friends from youtube we are troy and os 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:10.340
 we are going to present the review of itunes 11 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.340
 and remote for ios 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.310
 and so much 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.110
 do not 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.270
 and some of you will ask why I do 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.970
 the magazine of the applications together is 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.340
 very simple the two have updated and 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.150
 both include improvements that make 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.350
 they are compatible and that's why we do this 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.349
 review of the two applications in 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:37.310
 set on itunes is a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.350
 version to 11 completely new design 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.070
 full screen has this mini 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.420
 also super cool player 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.140
 and good is full screen airplay 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.719
 icloud you are going to need and we can go to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.530
 the different sections songs 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.980
 some artists genres videos all 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.730
 completely renovated as you see 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.520
 very cool very cool and one of the new 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.360
 functions in quotation marks a novelty 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.960
 aesthetic is that when we are on top 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.159
 of the disc unfolds 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 this with all the songs and as you see 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.530
 depending on the album that we open it will be 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.560
 one color or another 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.860
 because what does it do then it simply detects 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.159
 the color of the surrounding 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.830
 Y 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.630
 he imitates it is very cool very very cool 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.260
 and it's beautiful then another better here 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.840
 we also have our phone as 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.840
 You see everything all super cool 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.850
 just as we had it before we have 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.850
 everything all here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.030
 no applications had to him 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.030
 dice 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.880
 we have to wait for him to load 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 but come on let's go 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.700
 come on if you stop sending me messages 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.470
 it seems like it's going a little slow so 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.330
 I'm going to cut the video here and when 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.490
 Acquire just load by 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.010
 it's good he's finished loading and 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.460
 As you can see, this is exactly the same as 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.050
 before and now I do want to come back here 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.280
 without touching anything 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.280
 I accept it 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.739
 it's how we can our devices 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.080
 by wifi exactly as in 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.209
 previous versions and we also have 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.400
 the itunes store that has been renewed 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.739
 It looks a lot like 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.210
 stories that we have on the ipad 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:57.170
 have it defined from posts very similar 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.170
 and we are going to hope that here 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.700
 we go 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 and let's go 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 and good as you see is 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.690
 exactly the same if you have a 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.690
 ios device 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.890
 the stores that have opened new but 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.720
 blank 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.180
 the store is now blank 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.580
 if people who can not reach me 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.460
 in notifications but 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.380
 can not be less faced today and you have to 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:44.880
 hold on to the library 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.790
 and this is in terms of design and functions 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.030
 new the mini player is taught 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.150
 and another one that is very cool that is this 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.950
 here we have a list with the songs 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.200
 what 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.560
 are listening and listening in 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.230
 this motivation and there is the integration 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.890
 that is going to sound let's say for example that 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.269
 I want to hear our song let's go 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.900
 to add next and when to finish 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.900
 this song 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.209
 and at the same time be hearing but if 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.209
 distort 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 jump is already 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.540
 what would happen then what would it look like 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.400
 exactly as it was 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.400
 and this is what can be done in 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.360
 and the iphone as you see here I have the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.580
 lists with the following songs 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.070
 I can add any song 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.870
 whatever degree they have given me 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.700
 the town may be at the wheel or not 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.580
 give and this would be the next 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.750
 toned song is a function that is 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.460
 very good because there are times that you are 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.350
 listening to a playlist and 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.990
 suddenly and two not because I want 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.390
 Listen to this song you can hear it 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.640
 without having to put tourist 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.460
 a function that to me sincerely 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.270
 love that and the redesign 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.440
 and this is all has no more hope that 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.780
 you liked the video and you want me 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.210
 like favorites or subscribe to the channel 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.090
 do not follow on twitter as you have seen 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.740
 that a lot of people are not doing today 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.740
 and so far video
