00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 I took my card from the final episode 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.490
 and we will simply invoke a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 other final boss I remember that I have the 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.850
 kraft boss mode that is installed here and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.260
 which allows me to invoke if they work 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.550
 different so the final boss of my 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.440
 season it was this one it was the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.490
 flying ghost we go in this episode 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 bonus summoned the fire boss you 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.440
 have seen appear at the end of the bonus 1 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.540
 which apparently is pretty colossal and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 who beats there that promises a fight enough 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.380
 friendly we will invoke right in front 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 we will take refuge in the fortress 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.530
 and then listen, we're going to cross our fingers 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 for it to go well, that's it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 left as usual the parchment on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.810
 invoke one invoke one invoke 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 its good 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.760
 so obviously I was in a peaceful way 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.890
 did not work we go back it's a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 live and go back 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.250
 attention attention attention caution 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.330
 this time it's a good hospital 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 made me fall into the direct hole 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.290
 baron our barons we baron here we are 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.330
 he's just where he is huge 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.330
 it's no he white balance himself 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.880
 complains fire mashed mashed waiting 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.090
 waited so much time and we were on 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.260
 he's angry he's swaying full of flames 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 all around happily I have not 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.610
 invoke that one it would have been a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.610
 massacre 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.030
 there is a lot of things around him 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.840
 it's impressive what I put up there 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 nothing 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.200
 aulas has done it fire everywhere he has 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.490
 not look very very hard to beat 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.469
 on the other hand, much less difficult than 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 the ghost boss who was making 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.119
 gigantic leaps 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.709
 yeah that by cons he fucks the fire 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.840
 everywhere pretty impressed to fuck the 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.220
 fire to the statue to my tree it does not 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.019
 big thing finally he just balances 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.580
 fire so we just have to protect ourselves from 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.000
 fire then obviously it is not big 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.030
 thing but it's disastrous for the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.829
 fortress since it is against her 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.989
 she takes a firm slice and I 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.430
 but me what is it going to look hop he 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.599
 backs up when I type it so he opposes 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.599
 no real resistance 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.670
 when he's beefy there are a lot of 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.350
 points of life at he invoked waters 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.210
 there he summon monster posts 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.110
 attention attention i said nothing he is 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.330
 a little more complicated than expected 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.740
 finally that is invoked several 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.210
 years it gets a little complicated 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.740
 surely go back to his second phase 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.730
 which means he does not have to 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.820
 remained a lot of points of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.820
 life 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.200
 clearing clearing clearing off 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.150
 try to finish it off I try to avoid 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.959
 the flames still you have a lot of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.920
 points of life by cons I 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.799
 the impression that you have more points of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.310
 life that ghost boss that's it I'm them 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:16.730
 I see he gave unfortunately gave nothing nothing 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.310
 the jackal which he did not give the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.540
 crevice what nothing because the turn 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.790
 hi maique have nothing he has nothing 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.859
 gave it right ben listen here hump hump 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.109
 really nice very very pleasant 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.760
 he did a massacre because he screwed up 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.500
 fire at the bob lennon statue by 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 against the memory tree has managed to 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.359
 we resist such that infernal amato 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.370
 took a little fart at the barÃ§a on to my 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.659
 house that catches fire so thankfully 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.219
 luckily I had not chosen 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.709
 as the season's final boss because 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.459
 otherwise they would have taylor remained my 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.319
 fortress 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.400
 Well, that's the end of this episode 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.900

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.909
