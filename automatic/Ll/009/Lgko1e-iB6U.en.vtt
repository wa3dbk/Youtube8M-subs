core quality wise the loudspeaker is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
core quality wise the loudspeaker is
very<00:01:50.460> good<00:01:50.670> however<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.659> actual<00:01:51.930> earpiece<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
very good however the actual earpiece is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
very good however the actual earpiece is
quite<00:01:53.340> poor<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.689> tend<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
quite poor and so you will tend to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.999 
quite poor and so you will tend to

won't<00:01:59.219> cause<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> severe<00:01:59.939> problem<00:02:00.149> it's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
won't cause a severe problem it's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.390 
won't cause a severe problem it's
certainly<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.189> standard

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
certainly not that standard

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.240 
certainly not that standard
volume<00:02:04.300> rocker<00:02:04.510> on<00:02:04.690> this<00:02:04.840> side<00:02:05.100> we've<00:02:06.100> got<00:02:06.130> a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
volume rocker on this side we've got a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.910 
volume rocker on this side we've got a
USB<00:02:07.500> connector<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.620> that's<00:02:11.620> for

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
USB connector here and that's for

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.050 
USB connector here and that's for
headphones<00:02:12.460> and<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.600> charging<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.590> syncing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
headphones and for charging and syncing

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.550 
headphones and for charging and syncing
so<00:02:16.060> you're<00:02:16.210> stuck<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.900> bundled

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
so you're stuck with the bundled

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040 
so you're stuck with the bundled
headphones<00:02:18.340> moving<00:02:19.330> around<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> device<00:02:19.750> we

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
headphones moving around the device we

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.120 
headphones moving around the device we
have<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.230> micro<00:02:20.620> SD<00:02:20.980> slot<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.860> have

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
have a micro SD slot here and we have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.000 
have a micro SD slot here and we have
the<00:02:24.430> quick<00:02:25.150> shortcut<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.650> camera

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the quick shortcut to the camera

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.530 
the quick shortcut to the camera
application<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.370> that's<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> majority<00:02:31.510> of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
application so that's the majority of

made although it will look quite quite

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.930 
made although it will look quite quite
dirty<00:02:39.580> after<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.330> day<00:02:40.510> or<00:02:40.540> two<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.780> yous<00:02:41.940> all

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.030 

think<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:33.970> Android<00:04:34.650> or<00:04:35.650> iPhone

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
think on that Android or iPhone

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.330 
think on that Android or iPhone
webkit-based<00:04:37.000> browsers<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.750> think<00:04:37.930> we'd<00:04:38.050> be

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
webkit-based browsers I think we'd be

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.290 
webkit-based browsers I think we'd be
finished<00:04:39.340> by<00:04:39.670> about<00:04:39.880> now<00:04:41.850> yeah<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.030> think

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
finished by about now yeah I think

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.390 
finished by about now yeah I think
that's<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:43.840> very<00:04:44.530> exciting<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.100> look<00:04:45.190> at<00:04:45.370> a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
that's so very exciting to look at a

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.020 
that's so very exciting to look at a
white<00:04:45.580> page<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.050> think<00:04:47.140> more<00:04:47.610> leave<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.850> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
white page so I think more leave that to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.000 
white page so I think more leave that to
it<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:51.310> finally<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:52.800> fring<00:04:53.800> comes

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
applications at the top we have the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.470 
applications at the top we have the
camera<00:05:07.720> which<00:05:08.910> loaded<00:05:09.910> quite<00:05:10.060> quickly<00:05:10.240> that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
camera which loaded quite quickly that

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.730 
camera which loaded quite quickly that
time<00:05:10.800> which<00:05:11.800> will<00:05:11.950> respond<00:05:12.430> on<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.670> commands

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
time which will respond on the commands

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.110 
time which will respond on the commands
you've<00:05:14.740> actually<00:05:14.860> quite<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.220> few<00:05:15.400> nice<00:05:15.520> options

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
you've actually quite a few nice options

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.790 
you've actually quite a few nice options
there<00:05:16.360> which<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.720> shame<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.170> camera<00:05:17.530> itself

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
there which is a shame the camera itself

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.050 
there which is a shame the camera itself
doesn't<00:05:18.730> quite<00:05:18.850> match<00:05:19.030> up<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.390> software

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
doesn't quite match up to the software

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.490 
doesn't quite match up to the software
so<00:05:22.060> there<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.270> go<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.630> is<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.930> phone<00:05:23.230> arena

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
so there you go that is the phone arena

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.840 
so there you go that is the phone arena
