it<00:03:27.320> doesn't<00:03:27.650> I'd<00:03:28.100> say<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.340> only<00:03:28.430> negative<00:03:28.820> is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
it doesn't I'd say the only negative is

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.990 
it doesn't I'd say the only negative is
that<00:03:28.940> doesn't<00:03:29.299> stand<00:03:29.600> out<00:03:30.430> amongst<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.610> crowd

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that doesn't stand out amongst the crowd

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.729 
that doesn't stand out amongst the crowd
I<00:03:32.360> guess<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.780> like<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.049> can<00:03:33.260> though<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> think

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
I guess I like the can though I think

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.410 
I guess I like the can though I think
the<00:03:33.799> cans<00:03:34.010> interesting<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:34.610> simplistic<00:03:35.000> but

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
the cans interesting it's simplistic but

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.509 
the cans interesting it's simplistic but

think<00:04:50.560> they're<00:04:50.680> almost<00:04:50.800> on<00:04:51.070> par<00:04:51.100> with<00:04:51.310> one

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
think they're almost on par with one

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.180 
think they're almost on par with one
another<00:04:51.760> different<00:04:52.360> reasons<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.990> do<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.919> the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
another different reasons I do think the

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.400 
another different reasons I do think the
Napoleon<00:04:54.669> one<00:04:54.820> tastes<00:04:55.510> better<00:04:55.690> but<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.199> think

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
Napoleon one tastes better but I think

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.320 
Napoleon one tastes better but I think
it's<00:04:56.530> more<00:04:56.590> expected<00:04:57.070> way<00:04:57.430> more<00:04:57.460> expensive<00:04:57.910> I

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
it's more expected way more expensive I

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.360 
it's more expected way more expensive I
don't<00:04:59.020> know<00:04:59.169> how<00:04:59.350> much<00:04:59.470> he's<00:04:59.710> gonna<00:04:59.949> sell<00:05:00.220> this

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
don't know how much he's gonna sell this

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.890 
don't know how much he's gonna sell this
war<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:01.030> I<00:05:01.060> assume<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:01.449> pretty<00:05:01.630> not<00:05:01.750> gonna

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
war but I assume it's pretty not gonna

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.960 
war but I assume it's pretty not gonna
be<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.110> too<00:05:02.229> much<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.680> like<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.340> taste<00:05:03.610> the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
be for too much I like the taste the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.210 
be for too much I like the taste the
initial<00:05:04.389> taste<00:05:04.630> better<00:05:04.960> but<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.229> think<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:05.710> think

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
initial taste better but I think I think

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.070 
initial taste better but I think I think
the<00:05:06.400> overall<00:05:06.729> taste<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.389> better<00:05:07.600> on<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.900> one

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
the overall taste is better on this one

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.689 
the overall taste is better on this one
but<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> initial<00:05:08.530> better<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.490> kind

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
but the initial better on this is kind

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:10.770 
but the initial better on this is kind
