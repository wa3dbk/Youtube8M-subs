your on students get to choose more and
more<00:00:20.259> what<00:00:20.500> they're<00:00:20.680> interested<00:00:20.950> in<00:00:21.310> we<00:00:21.970> want

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
more what they're interested in we want

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.730 
more what they're interested in we want
them<00:00:22.270> to<00:00:22.300> have<00:00:22.480> some<00:00:22.900> breadth<00:00:23.200> so<00:00:23.470> they<00:00:23.590> know

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
them to have some breadth so they know

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.339 
them to have some breadth so they know
all<00:00:24.040> areas<00:00:24.490> but<00:00:25.300> we<00:00:25.390> also<00:00:25.540> want<00:00:25.869> them<00:00:26.020> to<00:00:26.080> get

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
all areas but we also want them to get

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.140 
all areas but we also want them to get
get<00:00:26.500> some<00:00:26.740> depth<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.250> be<00:00:27.580> you<00:00:27.850> know<00:00:27.939> really

keenly interested in one or one or more
areas<00:00:30.400> of<00:00:30.430> mathematics<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:32.050> so<00:00:32.199> we<00:00:32.320> offer

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
areas of mathematics and so we offer

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.590 
areas of mathematics and so we offer
that<00:00:32.739> in<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.190> upper<00:00:33.430> years<00:00:33.610> as<00:00:33.760> well<00:00:33.940> first

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
that in the upper years as well first

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.450 
that in the upper years as well first
year<00:00:34.780> is<00:00:34.960> fairly<00:00:35.260> standard<00:00:35.620> for<00:00:36.070> students

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
year is fairly standard for students

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.280 
year is fairly standard for students
doing<00:00:36.670> math<00:00:36.970> or<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.239> related<00:00:37.720> subject<00:00:37.900> they'll

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
doing math or a related subject they'll

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.869 
doing math or a related subject they'll
do<00:00:38.379> a<00:00:38.410> full<00:00:38.980> year<00:00:39.190> of<00:00:39.309> calculus<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.680> half<00:00:42.309> to

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
do a full year of calculus and a half to

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.970 
do a full year of calculus and a half to
a<00:00:42.910> full<00:00:43.210> year<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.510> linear<00:00:44.050> algebra<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.829> so

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
a full year of linear algebra and so

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.549 
a full year of linear algebra and so
there's<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> lot<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.399> pencil<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.000> paper<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
there's a lot of pencil and paper and

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.610 
there's a lot of pencil and paper and
you<00:00:48.250> know<00:00:48.340> blackboard<00:00:48.910> whiteboard<00:00:49.450> work<00:00:49.660> we

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
you know blackboard whiteboard work we

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.049 
you know blackboard whiteboard work we
have<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.739> nice<00:00:50.920> resource<00:00:51.309> room<00:00:51.700> that's<00:00:51.969> just

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
have a nice resource room that's just

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.420 
have a nice resource room that's just
full<00:00:52.420> of<00:00:52.450> students<00:00:52.960> during<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.320> year<00:00:53.530> has<00:00:54.399> a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
full of students during the year has a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.670 
full of students during the year has a
nice<00:00:54.640> bright<00:00:54.940> room<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:56.079> they're<00:00:56.320> up<00:00:56.440> at<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
nice bright room and they're up at the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.350 
nice bright room and they're up at the
bohr<00:00:56.829> helping<00:00:57.190> one<00:00:57.340> another<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:58.180> really

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
bohr helping one another it's really

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.600 
bohr helping one another it's really
quite<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.539> dynamic<00:00:58.750> place<00:00:59.260> yeah<00:00:59.980> I<00:01:00.399> like<00:01:00.579> to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
quite a dynamic place yeah I like to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.459 
quite a dynamic place yeah I like to
think<00:01:00.699> of<00:01:00.879> math<00:01:01.030> as<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> contact<00:01:01.660> sport<00:01:01.780> it's

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
think of math as a contact sport it's

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.170 
think of math as a contact sport it's
not<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.649> spectator<00:01:02.949> sport<00:01:03.250> we<00:01:03.850> want<00:01:04.059> them

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
not a spectator sport we want them

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.460 
not a spectator sport we want them
working<00:01:04.300> in<00:01:04.539> groups<00:01:04.809> talking<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.350> one<00:01:05.440> another

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
working in groups talking to one another

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.180 
working in groups talking to one another
talking<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.160> us<00:01:06.780> math<00:01:07.780> may<00:01:08.500> be<00:01:08.560> surprisingly

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
talking to us math may be surprisingly

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.380 
talking to us math may be surprisingly
the<00:01:09.340> some<00:01:09.460> people<00:01:09.550> is<00:01:09.789> a<00:01:09.820> very<00:01:10.060> interactive

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
the some people is a very interactive

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.160 
the some people is a very interactive
subject<00:01:11.380> very<00:01:11.710> social<00:01:12.509> subject<00:01:13.509> more<00:01:14.050> than

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
subject very social subject more than

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.380 
subject very social subject more than
you<00:01:14.229> might<00:01:14.380> think<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.399> what<00:01:15.759> we<00:01:15.789> find<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.360> that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
you might think and what we find is that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.990 
you might think and what we find is that
is<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:16.899> students<00:01:17.610> spontaneously<00:01:18.610> form

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
is that students spontaneously form

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.139 
is that students spontaneously form
study<00:01:19.270> groups<00:01:19.979> often<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.280> starts<00:01:21.610> out<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:22.060> an

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
study groups often that starts out in an

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.169 
study groups often that starts out in an
online<00:01:22.390> environment<00:01:23.819> using<00:01:24.819> using<00:01:25.149> a

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
online environment using using a

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.350 
online environment using using a
software<00:01:25.959> package<00:01:26.200> called<00:01:26.410> web<00:01:27.399> CT<00:01:27.759> that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
software package called web CT that

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.529 
software package called web CT that
Trent<00:01:28.869> uses<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.649> variety<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.069> courses<00:01:30.539> and

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
Trent uses in a variety of courses and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.169 
Trent uses in a variety of courses and
they<00:01:31.690> stick<00:01:31.929> in<00:01:32.080> those<00:01:32.229> groups<00:01:33.030> outside<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
they stick in those groups outside the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.430 
they stick in those groups outside the
web<00:01:34.300> environment<00:01:34.450> then<00:01:34.990> they<00:01:35.110> get<00:01:35.289> together

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
web environment then they get together

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.630 
web environment then they get together
and<00:01:35.679> one-to-one<00:01:36.550> face-to-face<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and one-to-one face-to-face and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.710 
and one-to-one face-to-face and
sometimes<00:01:39.640> those<00:01:39.819> groups<00:01:40.090> they<00:01:40.300> continue

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
sometimes those groups they continue

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.180 
sometimes those groups they continue
they<00:01:40.840> start<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.259> first<00:01:41.440> year<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:41.950> see

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
they start in first year and we see

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.040 
they start in first year and we see
those<00:01:42.310> same<00:01:42.640> students<00:01:43.149> working<00:01:43.330> together<00:01:43.599> in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
those same students working together in

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.650 
those same students working together in
groups<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.890> two<00:01:45.310> three<00:01:45.340> four<00:01:45.970> or<00:01:46.060> five<00:01:46.239> all<00:01:46.599> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
groups of two three four or five all the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.990 
groups of two three four or five all the
way<00:01:47.050> through<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.560> fourth<00:01:47.800> year<00:01:48.069> it's<00:01:48.819> really

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
way through to fourth year it's really

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.729 
way through to fourth year it's really
quite<00:01:49.149> nice<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.450> watch<00:01:49.599> I<00:01:49.869> mean<00:01:50.349> despite<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:50.739 
quite nice to watch I mean despite the

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:51.809 
quite nice to watch I mean despite the
fact<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.069> an<00:01:51.130> old<00:01:51.280> discipline

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
fact that it's an old discipline

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.190 
fact that it's an old discipline
obviously<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:54.039> know<00:01:54.099> going<00:01:54.310> back<00:01:54.429> millennia

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
obviously you know going back millennia

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.900 
obviously you know going back millennia
it's<00:01:56.200> also<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.440> modern<00:01:56.770> discipline<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.369> so

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
it's also a modern discipline and so

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.290 
it's also a modern discipline and so
it's<00:01:58.270> often<00:01:58.450> driven<00:01:58.869> by<00:02:00.119> applications<00:02:01.119> or

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
it's often driven by applications or

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.770 
it's often driven by applications or
problems<00:02:02.020> in<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.890> real<00:02:03.039> world<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:04.060> lot

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
problems in the real world and so a lot

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.419 
problems in the real world and so a lot
of<00:02:04.899> our<00:02:05.020> courses<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:05.590> exactly<00:02:06.160> like<00:02:06.250> that

of our courses are exactly like that
good<00:02:07.179> analytical<00:02:07.869> reasoning<00:02:08.289> skills<00:02:08.440> are

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
good analytical reasoning skills are

what you get so whichever area of
mathematics<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:11.260> go<00:02:11.379> into<00:02:11.709> you're<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.310> to

mathematics you go into you're going to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.130 
mathematics you go into you're going to
come<00:02:12.520> out<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:12.879> good<00:02:13.120> reasoning<00:02:13.629> skills<00:02:13.750> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
come out with good reasoning skills and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.300 
come out with good reasoning skills and
that<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.440> worth<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.770> lot<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.970> variety<00:02:16.150> of
