00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 this virus that inhabit other mines and 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.590
 would commit stations do not think and one of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.910
 the many things 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.440
 [Laughs] 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.740
 crossbow or homemade pistol first not 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.740
 they know their power of destruction 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.390
 yes 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.760
 good to do it we will need 5 sticks 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 of these ice creams a clothespin 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 these office silicone gun 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.630
 hot a rubber band a knife 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 saw to cut the sticks and a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 tape measure to a good meter what 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 first thing we have to do is measure 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.830
 the stick for example this measures 15 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 centimeters in half would be 7 and a half 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.580
 because we have to cut it by the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.650
 half and with the knife we ​​help each other and 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.840
 good to be more of the skinny because not 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.309
 there's a problem now with the gun 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.489
 silicone we're going to start joining the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.610
 pieces the mast we are going to join one of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.229
 those of the arms of the hurdler and then 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.690
 the other arm of the crossbow one on 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.309
 the other without problems and then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.010
 we closed what is the assembly of the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.990
 arms a little more silicone and what 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.659
 we mount this dry good cool 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.080
 right away and it perfectly meets the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.320
 the same bottom we stick it and already 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.210
 is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.760
 now let's do what is the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.090
 hilt puts them there a little more than 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
 hot silicone a long strip and already 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.410
 would be the hilt is super fast 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.140
 so nothing in 5 minutes goes is the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.810
 joined the main part with the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 grip and nothing can this way what 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.650
 same a little more hot silicone 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.160
 we put it in 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.130
 [Music] 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.430
 perpendicular in vertical like this and good already 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.490
 It would 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.530
 now let's put the clamp which is what 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.780
 that will trigger that will hold the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.510
 arrow the same as nothing a little more than 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.640
 Well, ideally hot glue 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.560
 it would be almost finished now only missing 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.450
 the propulsion that in this case is 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.580
 will charge the rubber band we will 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.979
 make two notches on each arm of the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.510
 crossbow with the help of the knife and with 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.090
 very careful not to cut us the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.160
 we do nothing a little notches what 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 just for the rubber to snag 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.250
 elastic and do not get out 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.910
 this way he gets or does not have much 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.030
 difficulty is taken from the notches the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.680
 rubber on both sides and I would be going 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.600
 to do an empty test to see that 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.860
 really goes well in the rubber does not 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.890
 It does not even jump and it's perfect 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.570
 try a success now to do the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.360
 good arrows the arrows are from 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.220
 skewer is a piece of brochette that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.319
 well I cut to do it a little bit 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.300
 shorter but we have the problem that 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.970
 tilt a bit like that let's do the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.550
 guide the arrow with a piece of 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.940
 same ice cream stick 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.130
 so we make a kind of guide and what 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.790
 same as with hot silicone what 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.790
 let's fix 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.410
 Okay, it would be finished now 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.420
 just make the notch so that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.370
 Engage the rubber well and at the time of 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.250
 propel it so do not miss 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.910
 propulsion because it gets away and now yes 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.870
 let's do the 01 shot test by 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.489
 say that it is crossbow yes yes what it is 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.650
 the arrow guide we do a little 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.800
 wider or bigger we could serve 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.940
 to throw pens pencils but good 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.770
 in this case I have done it a little more 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.290
 narrow as nothing happens we will launch 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.190
 the skewers but what was said 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.709
 would perfectly serve to launch 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.080
 pens and it would stick like the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.050
 skewers you will see the great way of 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.910
 load it you are seeing how it is done well 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.269
 simple the rubber is attached and with the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.950
 clamp is pressed and when released they come out 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.040
 fired 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.040
 [Music] 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.229
 i 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.229
 [Music] 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
 you can not see the result of the test 02 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:13.099
 with the pop potato 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:15.540
 [Music] 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.060
 Well I hope you liked a 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.370
 greeting mates good and if you like 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.630
 of the video subscribe give it a like

 share and comment if not then you know 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.910
