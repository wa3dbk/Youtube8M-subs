that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.670 
that
so<00:02:27.760> looking<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:28.690> roll<00:02:28.930> has<00:02:29.140> only<00:02:29.380> 100

so looking at this one roll has only 100
calories<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.640> means<00:02:31.000> happen<00:02:31.420> half<00:02:31.570> it's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
calories so that means happen half it's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.240 
calories so that means happen half it's
only<00:02:31.900> 50<00:02:32.290> calories<00:02:32.470> per<00:02:33.010> all<00:02:33.730> right<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.360> it
