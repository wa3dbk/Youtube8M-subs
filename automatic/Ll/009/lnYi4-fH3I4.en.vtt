00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Gundam f 91 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 1/100 Gundam f 91 Mobile Suit Gundam f 91 and the theater in 1991 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.070
 Two people who are 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.020
 Originally originally planned for the television series in line with the theater opening 10th anniversary of the first Mobile Suit Gundam 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.190
 The story of one cool part of the conflict for the TV series 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.690
 It is an image for theaters and it can be said that it is a symbolic existence of Gundam 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:34.390
 Three people of Tomino Yuka Ki Yasuhiko Yoshikazu Ogawara are aligned in a long time 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:39.500
 A big topic became a new topic setting 30 years after Char's back of Mobile Suit Gundam counterattack 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:43.160
 Produced with the aim of launching a new series by age and people 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.170
 The TV series that was supposed to be the sequel to f 91 was not produced 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.850
 At that time I was wondering if I would do it with video, but at last it was not animated 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.720
 Comics is a sequel to some extent drawn under the name of Mobile Suit Cross Bone Gundam after its 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.309
 Has been 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 More than the size of the conventional mobile suit as a feature of the mobile suit appearing in f 91 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.120
 Considerable miniaturization 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:08.580
 It can be mentioned against the 18 meters of the first Gundam 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 There is only 15m or so On the setting, it is an operation side by the mobile suit becoming large 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.890
 Is considered to be a cost reduction due to deficiencies in 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.060
 The real reason is the double zeta and phrase collection Shaa , and the standard size plastic model is expensive 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.510
 Than it turned into gone 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.550
 Cost reduction of product comes 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:29.380
 In fact to say that 1 of 100 minutes, such as f 91 and Denanzon which is said to have a ground 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.100
 Also the size of the conventional 144 Ã— 1 ball joint with a plastic cap and color plastic 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.170
 Technology 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.040
 Due to full-scale introduction of double joints etc., the price as a standard series is rather high 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.500
 Masu Tei 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.370
 This miniaturized setting is totally unacceptable from traditional fans 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 Especially dental was quite out complaints from the modeler 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:50.470
 The cancer plastic boomers are undergraduates and working people 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 There are not many people who graduated from Gundam or plastic model itself here . 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.880
 Or 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.570
 Mobile suit after f 91 itself is quite cool and popular mobile suit at the time 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.130
 Is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.590
 Oh dear 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.640
 Is a decent curry main mechanic design is new in the idea of Tomino director Kunio Okawara 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 Of the bowl-shaped, which is frequently used in so far in the series in order to aim the generation of design thruster 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.920
 Not adopted at all 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.000
 In other words , it is nonsense to add the nozzle at the time of remodeling 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.120
 An idea, such as placing a backpack or a bar with an unprecedented shape on the back 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 Obtained are rich 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.989
 The shape of the affected part is different from the previous designs of the Gundam series 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.580
 By the way, it is a kit, but it can be said that it is also a compilation of the technology of the stage at that time. 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.590
 It becomes an image of anime 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.579
 Two kinds of head are prepared, and one side stores mask and is version that face inside was exposed to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.110
 It has become 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.670
 This head was a secret until the release of the movie 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.510
 The release of the kit is made of clear parts except for 2 after the movie release 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.590
 It is to make the camera love shine by pasting from the wheel seal aura included in the kit 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.260
 It became popular 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.269
 This is more effective than painting silver on the back of clear parts, and some people are still doing it 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.739
 Those who bought the advance ticket for the movie at that time have a video of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 a Mansion 3-1 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:06.989
 I guess I bought a guy who's stuck, but the film was so funny, but the surroundings are 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.989
 I already had a double E on 3 topics.
