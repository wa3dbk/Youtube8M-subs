00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 In days full of pain and sadness, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 the beliefs never come true. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 This is how he came to feel like 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Asia during my journey towards a distant dream. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 But if I were to stop here, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 I feel that I would lose myself in this darkness. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 In the night I bit my lip with all my strength, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 and I heard someone's voice. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 The voice of the moonlight boomed. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 That voice motivated me to keep going! 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Every time I turn around, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 you are always by my side. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Were not you the one who silently gave me courage? 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Like that star that shines in the sky above us, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 it guides me to my destiny and to what I must do. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 The memories of my childhood, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 a voice to wake me from my dream. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 Your kind smile has already 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 saved in innumerable occasions. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I hope you sing this song of happiness someday. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Every time I worried about seeing you, 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 you are always by my side. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Were not you the one who silently gave me courage? 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 As the only star that shines on us two, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 It guides me in my destiny and in which they must return to me ....
