00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
feedback recently so here's the next

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.570 
feedback recently so here's the next
episode<00:00:11.580> we're<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.210> talk<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.389> fiber

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
episode we're going to talk about fiber

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
episode we're going to talk about fiber
fiber<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:15.000> important<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> our<00:00:15.990> body<00:00:16.199> obviously

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
fiber is important to our body obviously

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.980 
fiber is important to our body obviously
because<00:00:17.100> number<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.150> helps<00:00:18.449> keep<00:00:18.630> us<00:00:18.750> full

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
because number one it helps keep us full

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.929 
because number one it helps keep us full
and<00:00:19.619> number<00:00:19.830> two<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> helps<00:00:20.430> regulate<00:00:20.670> our

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and number two it helps regulate our

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
and number two it helps regulate our
digestive<00:00:21.510> system

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
digestive system

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
digestive system
you<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.100> fibers<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.609> carbohydrate<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.109> it's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you know fibers of carbohydrate but it's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.830 
you know fibers of carbohydrate but it's
got<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:25.920> less<00:00:26.130> calories<00:00:26.760> than<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.510> normal

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
got actually less calories than a normal

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
got actually less calories than a normal
car<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> don't<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.609> worry<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
car but I don't really worry about that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
car but I don't really worry about that
I<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> goal<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.470> fiber<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.859> hit

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I know I have a goal of fiber to hit

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
I know I have a goal of fiber to hit
which<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.759> current<00:00:32.969> macros<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> minimum

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
which on my current macros is a minimum

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100 
which on my current macros is a minimum
of<00:00:34.260> 25<00:00:34.770> grams<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.219> day<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.180> easily<00:00:36.420> hit<00:00:36.750> now

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of 25 grams a day which I easily hit now

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
of 25 grams a day which I easily hit now
I<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.530> people<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.340> low-carb

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
I know some people out there on low-carb

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
I know some people out there on low-carb
diets<00:00:39.680> that<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.739> trying<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> lose<00:00:41.190> weight<00:00:41.219> or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
diets that are trying to lose weight or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
diets that are trying to lose weight or
having<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> hard<00:00:43.050> time<00:00:43.110> hitting<00:00:43.469> their<00:00:43.620> fiber

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
having a hard time hitting their fiber

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
having a hard time hitting their fiber
goals<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.149> eating<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.600> lot

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
goals because they're just eating a lot

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.610 
goals because they're just eating a lot
less<00:00:46.020> food<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.300> easy<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
less food but it's pretty easy to do the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
less food but it's pretty easy to do the
number<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.070> place<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.149> should

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
number one place that you should

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
number one place that you should
probably<00:00:51.420> try<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.050> fibre<00:00:52.320> from<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.860> from

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
probably try to get fibre from is from

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably try to get fibre from is from
veggies<00:00:53.610> green<00:00:54.570> veggies<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.289> great<00:00:56.010> source

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
veggies green veggies are great source

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
veggies green veggies are great source
of<00:00:56.430> fiber<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> hot<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
of fiber this is hot because it just

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
of fiber this is hot because it just
made<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.460> bag<00:00:59.760> there's<00:01:00.210> about

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
made it but in this bag there's about

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.200 
made it but in this bag there's about
three<00:01:00.809> servings<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> there's<00:01:02.309> only<00:01:02.460> 8<00:01:02.730> grams

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
three servings and there's only 8 grams

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329 
three servings and there's only 8 grams
of<00:01:03.420> carbs<00:01:03.750> per<00:01:03.989> serving<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:04.890> grams<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of carbs per serving and two grams of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.300 
of carbs per serving and two grams of
fiber<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.030> 25%<00:01:06.510> fiber<00:01:07.110> basically<00:01:07.770> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
fiber so it's 25% fiber basically in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000 
fiber so it's 25% fiber basically in
this<00:01:08.490> thing<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.320> that's<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.770> got

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this thing and that's you know you got

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.969 
this thing and that's you know you got
24<00:01:11.520> grams<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.210> carbs<00:01:12.600> 6<00:01:13.380> grams<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> fiber

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
24 grams of carbs 6 grams of fiber

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.760 
24 grams of carbs 6 grams of fiber
that's<00:01:14.670> pretty<00:01:15.000> good<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.619> you're<00:01:16.619> getting

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's pretty good and you're getting

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.670 
that's pretty good and you're getting
like<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.100> said<00:01:17.340> nearly<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> pound<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> food<00:01:18.689> 2/3

of a pound of food by the tops these are
new<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> tip<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.170> think<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.470> tried

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
new to me this is a tip I think I tried

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
new to me this is a tip I think I tried
these<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.040> time<00:01:26.189> before<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.299> don't

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
these one time before but I don't

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
these one time before but I don't
remember<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> didn't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
remember but I don't know why I didn't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
remember but I don't know why I didn't
try<00:01:29.520> picking<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.030> again<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
try picking them up again because this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
try picking them up again because this
is<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> banana<00:01:31.380> chocolate<00:01:32.009> flavor<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:33.180> tastes

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
is the banana chocolate flavor it tastes

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
is the banana chocolate flavor it tastes
great<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.110> pop<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> toaster<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
great just pop it in the toaster you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.030 
great just pop it in the toaster you
leave<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> refrigerator<00:01:36.770> they<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.890> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
leave it in the refrigerator they can be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
leave it in the refrigerator they can be
found<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> freezer<00:01:38.820> aisle<00:01:39.090> near<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
found in the freezer aisle near like the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.399 
found in the freezer aisle near like the
aygos<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.420> each<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> 100

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
aygos and each one of them is 100

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
aygos and each one of them is 100
calories<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:44.009> 55<00:01:44.460> grams<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.149> pretty
