00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.130 
out after the first coat of nail polish
so<00:02:47.610> as<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.090> colors<00:02:49.420> first<00:02:49.630> coat<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.020> would

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
so as for this colors first coat I would

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.590 
so as for this colors first coat I would
have<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.380> say<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.400> tad<00:02:51.700> streaky<00:02:52.390> or

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
have to say that it is a tad streaky or

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.170 
have to say that it is a tad streaky or
more<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.319> patchy<00:02:53.860> actually<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.790> if<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.030> look

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
more like patchy actually so if you look

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.850 
more like patchy actually so if you look
close<00:02:55.360> enough<00:02:55.690> you'll<00:02:55.900> see<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.140> some<00:02:56.500> areas

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
close enough you'll see that some areas

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.830 
close enough you'll see that some areas
are<00:02:57.040> lighter<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.490> some<00:02:57.819> areas<00:02:58.180> are<00:02:58.330> darker

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
are lighter and some areas are darker

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
are lighter and some areas are darker
than<00:02:59.020> others<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.040> something<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.580> noticed

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
than others so something that I noticed

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.250 
than others so something that I noticed
with<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.180> nail<00:03:01.360> polish<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.170> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
with this nail polish is that it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.350 
with this nail polish is that it
definitely<00:03:02.770> will<00:03:02.950> need<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.459> second<00:03:03.880> coat<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
definitely will need a second coat and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.449 
definitely will need a second coat and
hopefully<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.110> will<00:03:05.230> fix<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.250> for<00:03:06.430> now

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
hopefully that will fix it but for now

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.400 
hopefully that will fix it but for now
let's<00:03:06.730> go<00:03:06.880> ahead<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.330> move<00:03:07.420> back<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.660> our<00:03:08.140> left

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.370 

and<00:03:33.819> here's<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.390> close-up<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.900> our<00:03:35.140> nails

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.660 
Velveteen so as for this nail polish
I've<00:03:41.140> got<00:03:41.319> to<00:03:41.500> say<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.220> do<00:03:42.400> prefer

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
I've got to say that I really do prefer

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.089 
I've got to say that I really do prefer
it<00:03:43.000> with<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.360> second<00:03:43.780> coat<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.680> gets<00:03:44.860> much

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
it with the second coat it gets much

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.040 
it with the second coat it gets much
more<00:03:45.280> opaque<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:46.330> do<00:03:46.480> enjoy<00:03:46.660> this

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
more opaque and I really do enjoy this

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.320 
more opaque and I really do enjoy this
like<00:03:47.349> different<00:03:48.190> type<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.430> texture<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.180> the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
like different type of texture on the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.540 
like different type of texture on the
nails<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:49.780> not<00:03:49.959> super<00:03:50.800> gritty<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.400> be

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
nails it's not super gritty to be

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.250 
nails it's not super gritty to be
considered<00:03:52.030> like<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.360> sugar<00:03:52.720> coat<00:03:53.019> or<00:03:53.230> anything

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
considered like a sugar coat or anything

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.500 
considered like a sugar coat or anything
like<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.739> but<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.640> not<00:03:54.760> super<00:03:55.180> smooth

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
like that but it's not super smooth

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.150 
like that but it's not super smooth
either<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.110> it's<00:03:56.230> not<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.500> same<00:03:56.709> effect<00:03:57.040> that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
either so it's not the same effect that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.370 
either so it's not the same effect that
you<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.489> with<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.880> matte<00:03:58.150> topcoat<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.230> would

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
you get with a matte topcoat so I would

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.780 
you get with a matte topcoat so I would
say<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.739> nail<00:03:59.920> polish<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.430> quite

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
say that this nail polish is quite

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.059 
say that this nail polish is quite
unique<00:04:01.209> but<00:04:02.080> let's<00:04:02.230> go<00:04:02.349> ahead<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.769> move<00:04:02.860> back

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
unique but let's go ahead and move back

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.949 
unique but let's go ahead and move back
onto<00:04:03.280> our<00:04:03.430> left<00:04:03.640> hand<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.180> see<00:04:04.450> if<00:04:04.690> the

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
onto our left hand and see if the

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.630 
onto our left hand and see if the
raspberry<00:04:05.560> color<00:04:05.769> turned<00:04:06.100> out<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.430> be<00:04:06.519> the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
raspberry color turned out to be the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:36.400 
raspberry color turned out to be the
same<00:04:06.850> way<00:04:07.060> with<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> second<00:04:07.660> coat<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:07.959> not

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.439 

so<00:04:37.410> once<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.889> finished<00:04:38.280> putting<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.820> my<00:04:39.030> second

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
so once I finished putting on my second

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.420 
so once I finished putting on my second
coat<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.870> noticed<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.440> my<00:04:40.560> pinky<00:04:40.949> finger<00:04:40.980> and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
coat I noticed that my pinky finger and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.700 
coat I noticed that my pinky finger and
my<00:04:41.550> ring<00:04:41.580> finger<00:04:42.120> seemed<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:42.990> lighter<00:04:43.320> than

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
my ring finger seemed to be lighter than

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.650 
my ring finger seemed to be lighter than
the<00:04:43.830> other<00:04:43.860> two<00:04:44.340> fingers<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.360> went<00:04:45.570> ahead

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
the other two fingers so I went ahead

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.050 
the other two fingers so I went ahead
and<00:04:45.870> put<00:04:46.350> on<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.500> third<00:04:46.919> coat<00:04:47.310> on<00:04:47.550> those<00:04:47.850> two

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and put on a third coat on those two

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.180 
and put on a third coat on those two
fingers<00:04:48.270> specifically<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.710> actually<00:04:50.040> did

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
fingers specifically and it actually did

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.400 
fingers specifically and it actually did
help<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.580> lot<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:51.000> actually<00:04:51.300> evened<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.690> out<00:04:51.840> but

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
help a lot it actually evened it out but

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.170 
help a lot it actually evened it out but
I<00:04:52.440> figured<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:53.130> note<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.370> for<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:53.820> guys<00:04:53.850> it

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
I figured I note that for you guys it

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.090 
I figured I note that for you guys it
was<00:04:54.210> kind<00:04:54.449> of<00:04:54.540> odd<00:04:54.780> those<00:04:55.320> two<00:04:55.500> fingers<00:04:55.710> just

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
was kind of odd those two fingers just

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.580 
was kind of odd those two fingers just
somehow<00:04:56.280> came<00:04:56.669> out<00:04:56.850> a<00:04:56.970> little<00:04:57.300> bit<00:04:57.449> lighter<00:04:57.810> so

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
somehow came out a little bit lighter so

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.990 
somehow came out a little bit lighter so
I<00:04:58.620> think<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:58.979> maybe<00:04:59.190> because<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.639> wasn't

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
I think it maybe because I wasn't

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.689 
I think it maybe because I wasn't
consistent<00:05:00.750> with<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.320> coats<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.919> nail<00:05:02.250> polish

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
consistent with the coats of nail polish

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.120 
consistent with the coats of nail polish
as<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.030> how<00:05:03.150> thick<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.600> was<00:05:03.780> applying<00:05:04.139> them<00:05:04.560> so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
as to how thick I was applying them so

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.469 
as to how thick I was applying them so
something<00:05:05.460> that<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.639> would<00:05:05.790> recommend<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.449> just

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479

bottles<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.930> nail<00:05:28.139> polish<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.270> as<00:05:30.270> for<00:05:30.630> my

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
bottles of nail polish so as for my

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.420 
bottles of nail polish so as for my
final<00:05:31.260> thoughts<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.710> these<00:05:31.979> two<00:05:32.220> nail

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
final thoughts on these two nail

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.370 
final thoughts on these two nail
polishes<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.180> really<00:05:33.630> could<00:05:33.840> only<00:05:33.930> think<00:05:34.260> of

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
polishes I really could only think of

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.200 
polishes I really could only think of
two<00:05:34.440> opportunities<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.460> share<00:05:35.850> with<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.060> all

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
two opportunities to share with you all

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.270 
two opportunities to share with you all
so<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.870> first<00:05:36.900> one<00:05:37.350> is<00:05:37.380> just<00:05:37.800> being<00:05:38.010> careful

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
so the first one is just being careful

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040 
so the first one is just being careful
when<00:05:38.580> you're<00:05:38.699> applying<00:05:38.880> your<00:05:39.210> layers<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.840> nail

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
when you're applying your layers of nail

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.290 
when you're applying your layers of nail
polish<00:05:40.470> simply<00:05:41.100> because<00:05:41.460> what<00:05:41.880> I<00:05:41.910> ran<00:05:42.150> into

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
polish simply because what I ran into

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.180 
polish simply because what I ran into
with<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.690> color<00:05:42.900> lavisch<00:05:43.380> where<00:05:43.590> some<00:05:43.889> nails

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
with the color lavisch where some nails

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.740 
with the color lavisch where some nails
came<00:05:44.490> out<00:05:44.610> darker<00:05:45.000> than<00:05:45.150> others<00:05:45.330> just

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
came out darker than others just

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.600 
came out darker than others just
something<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.320> keep<00:05:46.470> in<00:05:46.650> mind<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:47.280> make<00:05:47.310> sure

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
something to keep in mind to make sure

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.010 
something to keep in mind to make sure
you're<00:05:47.729> careful<00:05:47.970> about<00:05:48.270> how<00:05:48.630> thick<00:05:48.900> your

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
you're careful about how thick your

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.260 
you're careful about how thick your
layers<00:05:49.289> are<00:05:49.590> when<00:05:49.770> you're<00:05:49.889> painting<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:50.610> also

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
layers are when you're painting and also

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.670 
layers are when you're painting and also
the<00:05:51.419> second<00:05:51.810> thing<00:05:51.990> I'd<00:05:52.110> like<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.289> point<00:05:52.530> out

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
the second thing I'd like to point out

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.770 
the second thing I'd like to point out
is<00:05:52.830> that<00:05:52.950> these<00:05:53.099> nail<00:05:53.340> polishes<00:05:53.820> do<00:05:54.300> chip<00:05:54.630> a

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
is that these nail polishes do chip a

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.300 
is that these nail polishes do chip a
little<00:05:55.050> bit<00:05:55.169> earlier<00:05:55.500> than<00:05:55.710> what<00:05:55.830> I'm<00:05:55.950> used<00:05:56.190> to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
little bit earlier than what I'm used to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.760 
little bit earlier than what I'm used to
so<00:05:56.940> by<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.270> third<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.900> fourth<00:05:58.110> day<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.410> had

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
so by the third to fourth day I had

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.920 
so by the third to fourth day I had
pretty<00:05:59.039> bad<00:05:59.220> chipping<00:05:59.639> on<00:05:59.820> my<00:05:59.940> nails<00:06:00.150> so<00:06:00.450> I<00:06:00.750> do

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
pretty bad chipping on my nails so I do

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.839 
pretty bad chipping on my nails so I do
recommend<00:06:01.289> using<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.800> really<00:06:02.070> good<00:06:02.220> base<00:06:02.520> coat

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
recommend using a really good base coat

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.969 
recommend using a really good base coat
when<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.389> tested<00:06:03.900> these<00:06:04.020> out<00:06:04.229> I<00:06:04.260> did<00:06:04.560> not<00:06:04.770> use<00:06:04.950> a

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
when I tested these out I did not use a

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.260 
when I tested these out I did not use a
base<00:06:05.250> coat<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.669> there<00:06:05.789> was<00:06:05.910> really<00:06:06.120> bad

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
base coat and there was really bad

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.240 
base coat and there was really bad
chipping<00:06:06.690> so<00:06:07.200> I<00:06:07.229> do<00:06:07.349> recommend<00:06:07.710> for<00:06:08.010> you<00:06:08.099> all

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
chipping so I do recommend for you all

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.890 
chipping so I do recommend for you all
to<00:06:08.460> use<00:06:08.639> a<00:06:08.669> really<00:06:09.030> good<00:06:09.180> base<00:06:09.360> coat<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.780> you

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
to use a really good base coat and you

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.150 
to use a really good base coat and you
should<00:06:10.080> be<00:06:10.200> in<00:06:10.410> great<00:06:10.590> hands

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
should be in great hands

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.760 
should be in great hands
so<00:06:12.060> with<00:06:12.330> those<00:06:12.479> couple<00:06:12.720> of<00:06:12.840> things<00:06:13.050> in<00:06:13.200> mind<00:06:13.530> I

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
so with those couple of things in mind I

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.290 
so with those couple of things in mind I
would<00:06:13.830> say<00:06:14.099> that<00:06:14.310> I<00:06:14.340> really<00:06:14.610> do<00:06:14.820> honestly

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
would say that I really do honestly

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.510 
would say that I really do honestly
