00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
lightweight fairly streamlined so it's

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
lightweight fairly streamlined so it's
really<00:01:09.270> nice<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.500> each

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
really nice for something from each

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.969 
really nice for something from each
piece<00:01:11.189> camp<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.080> thing<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> see

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
here is just a six inch display it's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020 
here is just a six inch display it's
720p<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.950> push<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> light<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
720p I push through the light see a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
720p I push through the light see a
little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.540> higher<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> price<00:01:19.770> point

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
little bit higher but the price point

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
little bit higher but the price point
kinda<00:01:20.310> dictates<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
kinda dictates why it's like that of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.030 
kinda dictates why it's like that of
course<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.680> looking<00:01:22.920> for

course you know if you're looking for

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440 
course you know if you're looking for
normal<00:01:23.460> distance<00:01:23.700> shouldn't<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> too<00:01:24.299> much<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
normal distance shouldn't be too much of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.609 
normal distance shouldn't be too much of
a<00:01:24.630> problem<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.920> enough<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
a problem so it's good enough for that

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.109 
a problem so it's good enough for that
take<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.829> around<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.369> around<00:01:29.939> the

what<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> could<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.200> performance<00:02:49.379> is

good<00:02:50.040> enough<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.700> doesn't<00:02:50.849> seem<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
good enough you know it doesn't seem to

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.000 
good enough you know it doesn't seem to
be<00:02:51.390> lying<00:02:51.629> or<00:02:51.810> anything<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.260> good<00:02:52.709> amount<00:02:52.859> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
be lying or anything a good amount of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.220 
be lying or anything a good amount of
snappiness<00:02:53.519> response<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.780> again<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.109> is

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
snappiness response but again this is

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380 
snappiness response but again this is
just<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.620> simple<00:02:55.829> task<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:56.879> wait<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
just for a simple task that's wait and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.000 
just for a simple task that's wait and
see<00:02:57.510> how<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:57.690> performs<00:02:57.989> with<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.410> processor

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
see how it performs with more processor

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
see how it performs with more processor
intensive<00:02:59.310> ones<00:02:59.670> but<00:03:00.239> for<00:03:00.269> what<00:03:00.540> does<00:03:00.720> it'll

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
intensive ones but for what does it'll

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.780 
intensive ones but for what does it'll
get<00:03:01.290> probably<00:03:01.620> basic<00:03:01.980> stuff<00:03:02.160> done<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.639> it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
get probably basic stuff done with it

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.240 
get probably basic stuff done with it
not<00:03:03.000> much<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.389> problem<00:03:03.660> stock<00:03:04.530> interface<00:03:05.010> of

not much of a problem stock interface of
