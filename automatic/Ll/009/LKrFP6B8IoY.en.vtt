you know what water comes from the sky a
little<00:01:32.810> droplet<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:33.680> we<00:01:33.799> got<00:01:33.920> plenty<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.369> it

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
little droplet so we got plenty of it

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.850 
little droplet so we got plenty of it
and<00:01:34.880> there's<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.329> whole<00:01:35.509> ocean<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.380> earth<00:01:36.590> is

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860

and there's a whole ocean the earth is
like<00:01:37.039> fifty<00:01:37.670> thousand<00:01:38.090> percent<00:01:38.420> water<00:01:39.289> so

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
like fifty thousand percent water so

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.630 
like fifty thousand percent water so
there<00:01:41.479> take<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.020> one<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.890> think<00:01:43.280> about<00:01:43.460> that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
there take that one and think about that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.300 
there take that one and think about that

know if you pour the cereal in first you

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.660 
know if you pour the cereal in first you
need<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.020> reevaluate<00:02:00.409> your<00:02:00.830> life<00:02:01.099> no<00:02:01.459> if<00:02:01.580> you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
need to reevaluate your life no if you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.940 
need to reevaluate your life no if you
pour<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.000> milk<00:02:02.179> in<00:02:02.299> first<00:02:02.649> yes<00:02:03.649> if<00:02:03.860> you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
pour the milk in first yes if you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.020 
pour the milk in first yes if you
couldn't<00:02:04.189> milk<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.549> first<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.880> need<00:02:05.000> to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
couldn't milk in first you need to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.730 
couldn't milk in first you need to
reevaluate<00:02:05.299> your<00:02:05.630> life<00:02:05.810> come<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.170> cereal

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
reevaluate your life come on cereal

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.949 
reevaluate your life come on cereal
first<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.310> then<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.909> have<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.390> know<00:02:08.630> how<00:02:08.840> much

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
first and then you have to know how much

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.460 
first and then you have to know how much
milk<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.470> need<00:02:09.649> yes<00:02:10.220> exactly<00:02:10.849> but<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:12.079> guess<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
milk you need yes exactly but I guess it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.920

feels like if you're refilling like if

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
feels like if you're refilling like if
you're<00:02:15.049> going<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.349> round<00:02:15.470> two<00:02:15.799> that's<00:02:16.220> okay

you're going for round two that's okay

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.110 
you're going for round two that's okay
you<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.120> pour<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.959> cereal<00:02:18.940> there's<00:02:19.940> an
