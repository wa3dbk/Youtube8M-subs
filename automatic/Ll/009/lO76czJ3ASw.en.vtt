 bizarre 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.490
 he gets a solution and that leaves 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.420
 very happy 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.150

 same but it's fun too let's go 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.359
 pretend at this moment that I say something 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:09.739
 very important deep that justifies 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.659
 everything that happened 14 curiosity you 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.389
 loses a pilot episode where he played 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.650
 a full coloring hat 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.169
 blue green yellow is a crazy thing 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.269
 but when he actually entered his 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:25.090
 hat was no longer colored but rather 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.090

 where he played revealed that he is older 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.129
 that you dance and incredible as it may seem 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:47.780
 That boy is a lot older than we are. 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:49.549

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.169
 If you ever watched, you called. 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.049

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:56.209
 no news for you but there goes the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.720

 hope in each episode is a 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.540
 new experience a new madness and is 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.920
