00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.210 
ahead and take a look at this week's
changes<00:00:05.839> so<00:00:06.839> first<00:00:07.140> off<00:00:07.379> we<00:00:07.589> have<00:00:07.620> new

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
changes so first off we have new

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.030 
changes so first off we have new
textures<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:09.059> command<00:00:09.450> blocks<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.170> first<00:00:10.920> of

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
textures for command blocks so first of

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.620 
textures for command blocks so first of
all<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.190> can<00:00:11.309> see<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.670> default<00:00:11.940> command

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
all you can see the default command

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.839 
all you can see the default command
block<00:00:12.840> texture<00:00:13.259> has<00:00:13.410> changed<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.519> still<00:00:14.580> not

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
block texture has changed it's still not

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
block texture has changed it's still not
quite<00:00:15.150> centered<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:16.710> an

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
quite centered but it's actually an

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.580 
quite centered but it's actually an
animated<00:00:17.220> texture<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
animated texture now you can see the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
animated texture now you can see the
buttons<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.740> sort<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> light<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.970> glow

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
buttons on it sort of light up and glow

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720 
buttons on it sort of light up and glow
which<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> kind<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> cool<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:23.369> only<00:00:23.609> has

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
which is kind of cool and not only has

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.279 
which is kind of cool and not only has
the<00:00:23.939> texture<00:00:24.359> change<00:00:24.720> where<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.140> also

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the texture change where you can also

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.859 
the texture change where you can also
change<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> texture<00:00:26.369> again<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:27.240> switching

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
change the texture again by switching

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.960 
change the texture again by switching
the<00:00:28.019> mode<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.920> command<00:00:29.340> block<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the mode of the command block so here

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
the mode of the command block so here
it's<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.179> impulse<00:00:30.480> mode<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> change<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
it's an impulse mode if I change it to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.490 
it's an impulse mode if I change it to
chain<00:00:32.520> mode<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.110> changes<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
chain mode you can see it changes to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
chain mode you can see it changes to
sort<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.829> lime<00:00:35.160> green<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> change<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
sort of a lime green if I change it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
sort of a lime green if I change it
again<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> change<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> repeat<00:00:37.829> mode

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
again you can change it to repeat mode

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.790 
again you can change it to repeat mode
that<00:00:38.790> changes<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> purple<00:00:39.649> now<00:00:40.649> there

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that changes it to purple now there

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
that changes it to purple now there
repeat<00:00:41.070> mode<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> slash<00:00:42.600> say<00:00:42.899> hi

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
repeat mode you see I have slash say hi

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.740 
repeat mode you see I have slash say hi
up<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.649> repeat<00:00:44.460> mode<00:00:44.700> now<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> provide<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
up here repeat mode now if you provide a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.560 
up here repeat mode now if you provide a
signal<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.469> it'll<00:00:46.710> constantly<00:00:47.390> just<00:00:48.390> say

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
signal to this it'll constantly just say

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
signal to this it'll constantly just say
hi<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.559> over<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.739> over<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.980> over<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
hi over and over and over and over and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
hi over and over and over and over and
over<00:00:50.250> again<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:51.899> yeah<00:00:52.170> once<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
over again and then yeah once you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.150 
over again and then yeah once you
unpowered<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:54.079> now<00:00:55.079> stop<00:00:55.860> saying

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
unpowered it it will now stop saying

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
unpowered it it will now stop saying
that<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.489> yeah<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> repeat

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that so that is what the yeah the repeat

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.920 
that so that is what the yeah the repeat
mode<00:01:00.270> does<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.489> impulse<00:01:03.059> mode<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.780> like

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
mode does the impulse mode is just like

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.359 
mode does the impulse mode is just like
your<00:01:04.080> normal<00:01:04.199> command<00:01:04.559> block<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> that's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
your normal command block and that's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.270 
your normal command block and that's
also<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> defaults<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.869> just<00:01:07.170> basically<00:01:07.350> yeah

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
also the defaults so just basically yeah

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
also the defaults so just basically yeah
it<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.400> works<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.360> expect<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it just works as you would expect a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.710 
it just works as you would expect a
command<00:01:10.229> block<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> work<00:01:10.880> from<00:01:11.880> before<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
command block to work from before the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 
command block to work from before the
snapshot<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> finally<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.330> chain<00:01:15.720> command

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
snapshot so finally the chain command

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
snapshot so finally the chain command
blocks<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.799> command<00:01:17.250> locks<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:18.000> an

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
blocks so command locks now have an

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
blocks so command locks now have an
orientation<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.650> thing

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
orientation so you see this little thing

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
orientation so you see this little thing
on<00:01:20.340> top<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> pointy<00:01:21.720> edge<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
on top here with a pointy edge here this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
on top here with a pointy edge here this
basically<00:01:23.340> makes<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.689> command

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
basically makes it so that one command

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.510 
basically makes it so that one command
block<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> pointing<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.280> another

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
block is sort of pointing into another

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.499 
block is sort of pointing into another
one<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.900> chain<00:01:28.110> command<00:01:28.380> blocks<00:01:28.619> work

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
one and the chain command blocks work

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.390 
one and the chain command blocks work
like<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.110> basically<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
like this so basically if this is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
like this so basically if this is
powered<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.750> by<00:01:33.930> these<00:01:33.990> redstone

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
powered which it is by these redstone

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.940 
powered which it is by these redstone
blocks<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.110> previous<00:01:37.710> command

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
blocks then if the previous command

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.310 
blocks then if the previous command
block<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.490> pointing<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
block that is pointing into it's

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
block that is pointing into it's
successfully<00:01:40.320> execute<00:01:40.829> say<00:01:41.009> command<00:01:41.390> then

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
successfully execute say command then

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
successfully execute say command then
the<00:01:43.320> command<00:01:43.740> block<00:01:43.890> itself<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.610> will

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the command block itself here will

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.590 
the command block itself here will
execute<00:01:45.600> whatever<00:01:46.590> command<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.979> inside<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
execute whatever command is inside of it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.149 
execute whatever command is inside of it
so<00:01:48.600> doing<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.680> sort<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> chain

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
so doing that you can sort of chain

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
so doing that you can sort of chain
command<00:01:50.490> blocks<00:01:50.729> together<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.869> if

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
command blocks together like this so if

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.210 
command blocks together like this so if
I<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.350> ahead<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> place<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.950> down

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
I just go ahead and place this down

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
I just go ahead and place this down
you'll<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.630> command<00:01:54.899> execute

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you'll see that this command execute

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
you'll see that this command execute
then<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:56.790> then

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
then that one that one and that one then

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
then that one that one and that one then
that<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.210> than<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> way<00:01:58.530> down

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that one than that one all the way down

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.530 
that one than that one all the way down
the<00:01:58.799> line<00:01:59.869> wowee-wow-wow<00:02:00.869> guys<00:02:01.290> okay<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.540> this

the line wowee-wow-wow guys okay so this

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.030 
the line wowee-wow-wow guys okay so this
next<00:02:03.810> change<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> probably<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.860> biggest

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
next change is probably the biggest

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.660 
next change is probably the biggest
change<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.790> minecraft<00:02:06.659> combat<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.670> several

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
change to minecraft combat in several

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.260 
change to minecraft combat in several
years<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> they've<00:02:10.950> added<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.489> tech<00:02:11.760> strength

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
years so they've added a tech strength

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.880 
years so they've added a tech strength
to<00:02:12.660> Minecraft

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to Minecraft

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.400 
to Minecraft
so<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.190> means<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:15.630> now<00:02:15.960> attack

I'm gonna put it in my crosshair here

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.949 
I'm gonna put it in my crosshair here
and<00:02:44.130> you'll<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.640> strike<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.360> there<00:02:45.780> is

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and you'll see if I strike here there is

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.570 
and you'll see if I strike here there is
a<00:02:45.990> little<00:02:46.380> bit<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.709> sword<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> comes<00:02:47.370> up

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
a little bit of a sword that comes up

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780 
a little bit of a sword that comes up
and<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.060> bar<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:49.430> shows<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.640> as

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and there's a bar that's shows up as

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.590 
and there's a bar that's shows up as
well

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
well

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.510 
well
and<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.200> indicates<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.770> attack<00:02:53.100> strengths

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
and that indicates your attack strengths

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.790 
and that indicates your attack strengths
so<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.880> strike<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:54.840> wait<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.500> attack

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
so if I strike and then wait the attack

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.740 
so if I strike and then wait the attack
strength<00:02:56.070> bar<00:02:56.400> fills<00:02:56.730> up<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
strength bar fills up and now I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080 
strength bar fills up and now I
construct<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.500> strike<00:02:58.739> with<00:02:58.890> maximum<00:02:59.400> damage

days of spam clicking you actually have

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.600 
days of spam clicking you actually have
to<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.810> about<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.530> time<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.430> hits

appropriately now so that is amazing

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.390 
appropriately now so that is amazing
also<00:03:57.330> when<00:03:57.660> switching<00:03:57.989> weapons<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.980> attack

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
also when switching weapons the attack

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.520 
also when switching weapons the attack
strength<00:03:59.760> does<00:04:00.209> not<00:04:00.239> immediately<00:04:00.690> start<00:04:01.410> off

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
strength does not immediately start off

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.990 
strength does not immediately start off
at<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.950> maximum<00:04:02.370> strength<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:02.730> takes<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
at the maximum strength it takes a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.130 
at the maximum strength it takes a
little<00:04:03.120> while<00:04:03.330> as<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.540> see<00:04:03.750> there<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.959> charge

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
little while as you see there to charge

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.920 
little while as you see there to charge
up<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.650> different<00:04:05.519> weapons<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.239> items<00:04:06.600> have

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
up and different weapons and items have

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.620 
up and different weapons and items have
different<00:04:07.320> recharge<00:04:07.920> times<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.390> see<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
different recharge times so you see the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.449 
different recharge times so you see the
sword<00:04:09.870> goes<00:04:10.320> pretty<00:04:10.530> quick<00:04:10.829> whereas<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> axe

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
sword goes pretty quick whereas the axe

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.550 
sword goes pretty quick whereas the axe
goes<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> little<00:04:12.060> bit<00:04:12.209> slower<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.780> your<00:04:13.380> hand

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
goes a little bit slower and your hand

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.159 
goes a little bit slower and your hand
actually<00:04:13.709> goes<00:04:14.010> super<00:04:14.370> fast<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.850> hand

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
actually goes super fast so the hand

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.469 
actually goes super fast so the hand
recharges<00:04:16.169> very<00:04:16.859> very<00:04:17.100> quickly<00:04:17.370> also<00:04:18.030> when<00:04:18.390> on

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
recharges very very quickly also when on

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.180 
recharges very very quickly also when on

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
little bit more detailed than the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.409 
little bit more detailed than the
crosshair<00:04:24.840> indicator<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.560> can<00:04:25.710> tell<00:04:26.419> also

this<00:04:27.720> week<00:04:27.930> they've<00:04:28.230> added<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> ability<00:04:28.800> to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
this week they've added the ability to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.430 
this week they've added the ability to
zoom<00:04:29.460> into<00:04:29.880> maps<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.780> check<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.200> out<00:04:31.410> so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
zoom into maps so check this out so

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.500 
zoom into maps so check this out so
first<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.070> all<00:04:32.100> if<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.340> populate<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> map<00:04:33.090> you'll

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
first of all if I populate a map you'll

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.540 
first of all if I populate a map you'll
see<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.170> pretty<00:04:34.890> zoomed<00:04:35.220> out<00:04:35.340> when<00:04:35.520> I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
see that it is pretty zoomed out when I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.870 
see that it is pretty zoomed out when I
first<00:04:35.790> created<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.600> this<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:36.930> actually<00:04:37.350> at<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
first created so this is actually at a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.690 
first created so this is actually at a
scale<00:04:38.880> level<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.420> 1<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.170> 4<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.250> that's<00:04:41.400> more

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
scale level of 1 to 4 so that's more

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.030 
scale level of 1 to 4 so that's more
than<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:41.940> was<00:04:42.090> previously<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.830> way<00:04:43.980> you

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
than it was previously and the way you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.220 
than it was previously and the way you
zoom<00:04:44.490> in<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:45.570> can<00:04:45.600> still<00:04:45.870> zoom<00:04:45.930> out<00:04:46.170> the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
zoom in now you can still zoom out the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.890 
zoom in now you can still zoom out the
same<00:04:46.560> way<00:04:46.740> but<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.910> zoom<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.300> by<00:04:48.450> placing<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
same way but you zoom in by placing a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.930 
same way but you zoom in by placing a
map<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.530> some<00:04:50.040> shears<00:04:50.340> into<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> crafting

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
map and some shears into a crafting

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.220 
map and some shears into a crafting
table<00:04:51.060> like<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.630> you'll<00:04:51.750> see<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.990> scale

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
table like that and you'll see the scale

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.390 
table like that and you'll see the scale
is<00:04:52.350> 1<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.650> 4<00:04:52.860> here<00:04:53.280> but<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.240> 1<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.690> 2<00:04:54.930> here<00:04:55.440> so

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
is 1 to 4 here but it is 1 to 2 here so

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.980 
is 1 to 4 here but it is 1 to 2 here so
now<00:04:56.520> if<00:04:56.580> we<00:04:56.640> take<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.850> look<00:04:57.060> at<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:57.630> much

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
now if we take a look at this is much

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.410 
now if we take a look at this is much
more<00:04:58.200> zoomed<00:04:58.500> in<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.950> if<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.760> fill<00:05:00.150> out<00:05:00.180> the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
more zoomed in and if you fill out the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.130 
more zoomed in and if you fill out the
whole<00:05:00.450> map<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:01.110> goes<00:05:01.410> from<00:05:01.770> this<00:05:02.400> at<00:05:02.700> 1<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.060> 4<00:05:03.300> to

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
whole map it goes from this at 1 to 4 to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.830 
whole map it goes from this at 1 to 4 to
this<00:05:04.410> at<00:05:04.620> 1<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.950> 2<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.160> you<00:05:05.430> can<00:05:05.550> also<00:05:05.670> do<00:05:05.970> 1<00:05:06.690> to

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
this at 1 to 2 and you can also do 1 to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.530 
this at 1 to 2 and you can also do 1 to
1<00:05:07.370> zombies<00:05:08.370> will<00:05:08.550> also<00:05:08.820> raise<00:05:09.000> their<00:05:09.270> arms

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
1 zombies will also raise their arms

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.700 
1 zombies will also raise their arms
whenever<00:05:09.720> they're<00:05:09.930> tracking<00:05:10.230> you

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
whenever they're tracking you

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.080 
whenever they're tracking you
so<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:10.920> see<00:05:11.070> their<00:05:11.190> arms<00:05:11.430> are<00:05:11.550> sort<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:11.940> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
so you see their arms are sort of in the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.660 
so you see their arms are sort of in the
