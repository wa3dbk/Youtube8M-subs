expensive and you can get just as good
online<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.480> know<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.660> could<00:03:51.870> get<00:03:51.959> like

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
online and you know you could get like

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.949 
online and you know you could get like
online<00:03:52.590> TV<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:52.980> cheaper<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.609> mean<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.840> know

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
online TV is cheaper I mean you know

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.440 
online TV is cheaper I mean you know
it's<00:03:55.519> like<00:03:56.519> having<00:03:56.880> phone<00:03:57.120> line<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
it's like having phone line and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.629 
it's like having phone line and
everything<00:03:57.720> else<00:03:58.079> now<00:03:58.350> right<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.609> a

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
everything else now right if you have a

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.699 
everything else now right if you have a
cell<00:03:59.910> phone<00:03:59.940> it's<00:04:00.420> almost<00:04:00.690> no<00:04:01.109> reason<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.590> have

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
cell phone it's almost no reason to have

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.530 
cell phone it's almost no reason to have
a<00:04:01.769> phone<00:04:02.100> because<00:04:02.310> everyone<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.880> text<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.359> I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
a phone because everyone just text you I

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.449 
a phone because everyone just text you I
mean<00:04:04.230> if<00:04:04.440> it's<00:04:04.620> something<00:04:04.859> quick<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.280> simple

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
mean if it's something quick and simple

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.539 
mean if it's something quick and simple
so<00:04:06.530> there's<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.769> then<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.220> got<00:04:08.400> my

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
so there's that then you got my

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.059 
so there's that then you got my
amplifier<00:04:09.150> which<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> pioneer<00:04:10.590> 11<00:04:11.100> 25<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
amplifier which is a pioneer 11 25 if I

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.219 
amplifier which is a pioneer 11 25 if I
love<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.250> think<00:04:14.639> it's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.880> hundred<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.660> ten

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
love it I think it's a hundred and ten

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.640 
love it I think it's a hundred and ten
watts<00:04:16.620> per<00:04:17.010> channel<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.989> pumps<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.470> clip

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
watts per channel and it pumps the clip

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.890 
watts per channel and it pumps the clip
system<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:20.130> more<00:04:20.729> than<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.030> need<00:04:21.239> for<00:04:21.510> here<00:04:21.750> I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
system is more than I need for here I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.550 
system is more than I need for here I
was<00:04:22.440> originally<00:04:22.620> gonna<00:04:22.890> buy<00:04:23.070> 15<00:04:23.580> 27<00:04:24.180> or<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:25.349> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
was originally gonna buy 15 27 or at the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.700 
was originally gonna buy 15 27 or at the
time<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.979> was<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.099> fifth

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
time it was a fifth

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.910 
time it was a fifth
25<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.760> have<00:04:29.480> no<00:04:29.690> space<00:04:30.020> for<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.770> like

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
25 but I have no space for it just like

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.070 
25 but I have no space for it just like
I<00:04:31.040> was<00:04:31.160> going<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.340> buy<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.780> bigger<00:04:32.780> clip

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
I was going to buy the bigger clip

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.410 
I was going to buy the bigger clip
center<00:04:33.440> channel<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.490> have<00:04:34.640> no<00:04:34.850> space<00:04:35.120> for

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
center channel and I have no space for

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.110 
center channel and I have no space for
it<00:04:35.600> so<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.110> just<00:04:36.410> want<00:04:36.770> with<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.370> package<00:04:38.090> and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it so I just want with the package and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.540 
it so I just want with the package and
then<00:04:38.420> i<00:04:38.780> bought<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.140> amplifier<00:04:39.890> separate

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
then i bought the amplifier separate

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.940 
then i bought the amplifier separate
because<00:04:40.640> i<00:04:40.760> got<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.940> really<00:04:41.210> good<00:04:41.300> deal<00:04:41.450> on<00:04:41.600> it

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
because i got a really good deal on it

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.530 
because i got a really good deal on it
there<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.340> just<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.880> regular<00:04:44.090> Telus

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
there you have just a regular Telus

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.250 
there you have just a regular Telus
router<00:04:46.090> one<00:04:47.090> day<00:04:47.240> I'll<00:04:47.360> probably<00:04:47.570> upgrade<00:04:48.050> to

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
router one day I'll probably upgrade to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.380 
router one day I'll probably upgrade to
a<00:04:48.290> cisco<00:04:48.830> because<00:04:49.340> cisco<00:04:49.730> is<00:04:49.910> probably<00:04:50.240> my

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
a cisco because cisco is probably my

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.960 
a cisco because cisco is probably my
favorite<00:04:50.420> now<00:04:50.930> from<00:04:51.230> dealing<00:04:51.590> with<00:04:51.740> them<00:04:52.610> for

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
favorite now from dealing with them for

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.610 
favorite now from dealing with them for
you<00:04:53.420> know<00:04:53.540> setting<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:54.020> their<00:04:54.200> stuff<00:04:54.470> in

cisco router and the signal strength is

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.040 
cisco router and the signal strength is
amazing<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.700> can<00:05:01.910> put<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.270> in<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.420> mansion<00:05:02.720> and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
amazing you can put it in a mansion and

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.170 
amazing you can put it in a mansion and
get<00:05:03.230> it<00:05:03.350> in<00:05:03.440> every<00:05:03.560> single<00:05:03.830> room<00:05:04.010> and<00:05:04.340> of

get it in every single room and of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.730 
get it in every single room and of
course<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.630> speeds<00:05:05.930> you<00:05:06.170> just<00:05:06.380> can't<00:05:06.560> beat

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
course the speeds you just can't beat

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.850 
course the speeds you just can't beat
them<00:05:07.270> nothing<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.570> course<00:05:08.690> better<00:05:09.020> than<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
them nothing is of course better than a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.220 
them nothing is of course better than a
wired<00:05:10.160> connection<00:05:10.490> but<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.240> comes<00:05:11.930> pretty

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
wired connection but it comes pretty

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.070 
wired connection but it comes pretty
damn<00:05:12.560> close<00:05:12.860> when<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.250> get<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.670> next

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
damn close when you get to that next

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.110 
damn close when you get to that next
thing<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.260> course<00:05:15.500> which<00:05:16.340> we<00:05:16.520> have<00:05:16.640> down<00:05:16.910> the

thing of course which we have down the

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.140 
thing of course which we have down the
bottom<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.720> call<00:05:18.200> this<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.730> bottom<00:05:19.730> shelf<00:05:19.910> of
