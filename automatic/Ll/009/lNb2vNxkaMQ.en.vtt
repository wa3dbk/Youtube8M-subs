underneath the van for the vegetable oil

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.200 
underneath the van for the vegetable oil
and<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> eat<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.680 

open<00:00:58.750> over<00:00:58.870> there

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.830 

going<00:01:03.649> to<00:01:03.739> zoom<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.040> on<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.159> stream<00:01:04.580> there

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
going to zoom in on that stream there

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
going to zoom in on that stream there
nice<00:01:07.049> clean<00:01:07.350> air<00:01:07.439> flow<00:01:07.740> when<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.039> can<00:01:08.159> see

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
nice clean air flow when you can see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.810 
nice clean air flow when you can see
it's<00:01:08.429> real<00:01:08.579> fair<00:01:08.820> like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.660 

you're<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:12.970> tease

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.100 

yeah<00:01:15.939> so<00:01:16.240> we're<00:01:16.360> going<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.540> fill<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:16.900> if

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
yeah so we're going to fill that up if

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.749 
yeah so we're going to fill that up if
you<00:01:17.200> look<00:01:17.380> on<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:17.740> tank<00:01:18.070> actually<00:01:18.400> it's<00:01:18.729> a

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
you look on to this tank actually it's a

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.850 
you look on to this tank actually it's a
good<00:01:18.939> way<00:01:19.659> to<00:01:19.720> put<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:19.990> camera<00:01:20.259> down<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.650> it's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
good way to put the camera down and it's

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.380 
good way to put the camera down and it's
what's<00:01:21.100> called<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.400> heat<00:01:21.580> exchanger<00:01:22.060> inside

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
what's called a heat exchanger inside

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.929 
what's called a heat exchanger inside
and<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:23.259> actually<00:01:23.500> picks<00:01:24.399> coolant<00:01:24.790> from<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
and that actually picks coolant from the

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.539 
and that actually picks coolant from the
engine<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.540> metal<00:01:25.869> thing<00:01:25.899> down<00:01:26.259> here<00:01:26.439> and<00:01:26.710> it

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
engine this metal thing down here and it

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.609 
engine this metal thing down here and it
cycles<00:01:27.820> coolant<00:01:28.390> through<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.110> keeps<00:01:29.439> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
cycles coolant through and it keeps the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.340 
cycles coolant through and it keeps the
oil<00:01:29.710> up<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.210> temperature<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.869> where<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.259> will

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
oil up to a temperature to where it will

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.280 
oil up to a temperature to where it will
flow

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
flow

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.250 
flow
through<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.390> fuel<00:01:35.390> injectors<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:35.930> engine

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
through the fuel injectors in the engine

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.160 
through the fuel injectors in the engine
so<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.950> can<00:01:37.220> use<00:01:37.370> vegetable<00:01:37.610> oil<00:01:37.940> as<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.360> fuel

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
so you can use vegetable oil as a fuel

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.570 
so you can use vegetable oil as a fuel
on<00:01:39.320> any<00:01:39.470> Diesel's<00:01:40.100> long

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
on any Diesel's long

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.950 
on any Diesel's long
been<00:01:40.730> converted<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.180> be<00:01:41.360> able<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.630> heat<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
been converted to be able to heat the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.600 
been converted to be able to heat the
oil<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.440> filter<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.920> oil<00:01:42.950> free

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.000 

for<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.970> walk<00:01:47.180> around<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> front<00:01:47.690> of<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.870> man

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
for a walk around the front of the man

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.260 
for a walk around the front of the man
these<00:01:51.010> are<00:01:51.159> our<00:01:51.190> two<00:01:51.430> electric<00:01:51.850> filters

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
these are our two electric filters

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.810 
these are our two electric filters
useful<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.409> dirty<00:01:53.979> oil<00:01:54.070> down<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.610> two

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
useful to the dirty oil down the two

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.469 
useful to the dirty oil down the two
microns<00:01:55.330> which<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.549> extremely<00:01:57.549> fine<00:01:57.880> really

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
microns which is a extremely fine really

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.310 
microns which is a extremely fine really
cleans<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.930> out

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
cleans it out

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.370 
cleans it out
so<00:02:01.250> everything<00:02:01.760> travels<00:02:02.150> through<00:02:02.300> here<00:02:02.540> we're

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so everything travels through here we're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.840 
so everything travels through here we're
going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.530> walk<00:02:03.680> around<00:02:03.860> front<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.670> man

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to walk around front of the man

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
going to walk around front of the man
and<00:02:05.120> i'm<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.630> show<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.070> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and i'm going to show you the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:19.930 
and i'm going to show you the
you<00:02:07.980> know

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.980 

right<00:02:20.940> here<00:02:21.090> we've<00:02:21.210> got<00:02:21.240> our<00:02:21.360> dirty<00:02:21.690> tank

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
right here we've got our dirty tank

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.660 
right here we've got our dirty tank
gauge<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.620> tells<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.070> much<00:02:23.160> fuels<00:02:23.490> in

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
gauge that tells it how much fuels in

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.730 
gauge that tells it how much fuels in
the<00:02:23.730> dirty<00:02:23.970> tank<00:02:24.350> right<00:02:25.350> here<00:02:25.470> we've<00:02:25.590> got<00:02:25.620> our
