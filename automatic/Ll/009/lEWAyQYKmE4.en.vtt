 the animated film planet 51 is about to premiere is the 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.530
 bet more expensive and risky Spanish cinema and aims to compete with the

 great studies of colima lying 55 million euros seven years of work 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.560

 - the entrails benjamin badges 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.849
 his texts many of us are calmly discouraging studies currently the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.749
 defense studies important people after the seven deep pacts 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.030
 years by four 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.920
 Spanish entrepreneurs believe that we wanted to see 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.600
 piluco the natural need for 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.390
 Telling stories led us to found a script and start adventure dolphins 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.400
 with a special plan 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.260
 'planet 51' is the most expensive movie in the cinema 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.430
 Spanish with a budget of 55 million 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.960
 reuters this budget is not allowed the possibility of power 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 compete with the great American international studios 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.100
 we always had present p 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 the fact that we have to get 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.280
 a new idea 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.330
 that would allow us to compete 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.190
 others 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.979
 something cool studios always fleeing movies 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:11.940
 animals 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.990
 and it was when we came up with the idea of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.260
 why not tell a story about aliens 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.350
 turning it around 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.310
 that is to say that an alien straightens 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.500
 coming 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.079
 it's us who come to a 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.589
 planet aliens and we are he who we have in alien london 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.260
 they can attend all galicia 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 that already the reading between all 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.880
 now 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.719
 to appealed 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.230
 both the address 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.660
 as the production as the design is entirely 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.160
 Spanish although it is true that we have I Westin wholesaler of 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 herrera since our world efe 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.960
 the little workers the america of 2004 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.630
 and we need someone who could transmit us 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 everyone knows each other 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.520
 the process of job destruction without your clause really like any other 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 movie that communion 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.759
 a script developed from the idea 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.819
 from there the production process of any film 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.759
 it is radically different from the movies in the real image 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.099
 the action with actors 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.800
 once we have a very primary although we consider enough to 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.140
 turn it into a work script for the rest of the departments 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.879
 I think we do 3 start planning the sevilla 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.349
 the outside does not stop being another thing that to do a bullet hugo arias depending 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.900
 of the complexity of the plane for each of the planes that will appear in the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.999
 movie 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.149
 once that is planned 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.769
 is that we have to the first outside take actors to record us jose 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.109
 serra france 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.519
 we recorded those voices from the script 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.519
 and we started avoiding what is called an animal 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.069
 that the girl you fall for take those story cartoons scan them 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.509
 i the ita exceeding the duration what each of the plans should have in 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.619
 the movie the face of the iotc is the later 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.749
 in the logical next step given the idea of ​​matica 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:16.149
 consists in converting all that audiovisual narrative all that planning that 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.099
 we have done in 12 for the first time in an environment 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.749
 with which summary is a version of the film in low resolution 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.979
 but in which all the camera moments are already all the characters 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.519
 in the place where the choreography has already been defined for the first time 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.519
 time in 3d within the world of art 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.719
 yes that step 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.239
 biden production claimed as 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.530
 planet 51 3 the design of characters and scenarios to pose outlined 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.849
 about 440 people witnesses that probably says it's the movie 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.679
 with the largest number of unique characters 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.060
 The rest of the night 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.879
 without exaggerating the least 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.069
 scenario we are development 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.339
 around 50 main locations 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:06.299
 killed about 30 secondary streets and surrounding areas 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.729
 of the places where the main room of the plan passes 51 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.039
 All scenario design is based on the references we have of the 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.989
 alien world 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.530
 the Ahmadi circles the films of the fifties series of this i 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.780
 in the america of the 50 transplanted that yes to an alien world 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.839
 Once we have already designed the characters and the scenarios, we have to 

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.309
 model the 3d 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.169
 ideapress the textures that is to say the color and the mules in the matter 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.639
 to animate the characters since only you animation 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.939
 those who build a sector 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.639
 not everything is a skeleton so that the characters can be 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.620
 managed in an easy way by the animators and the fair 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.450
 that mesh s 3d model to the skeleton that has been given 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.240
 so saying that each part is reading the character moves in such a way when 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.159
 we move torturous little by little 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.509
 the animation process consists of taking the characters that are already prepared 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.409
 dyn 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.860
 the scenes cheer up 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.449
 we have approved on the key 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.449
 percent encouraging each of the characters 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.389
 in the plane 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.919
 they are being restored 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.770
 main voices and then from there go tuning the nations others 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.860
 infernal elements 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.749
 after the process is the destination 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.289
 we put the animation together with all the backgrounds and sets 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.400
 we go to the final part of the whole production process is the 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.780
 lighting of the planes 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.940
 each illuminator each artist works depends on the complexity of plane in 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.789
 one or two plans a week 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.090
 the generation of all the effects fumes explosions the grass moving 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.450
 and the composition 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.050
 that expose everything together 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.529
 the lighting layers with the defects to get 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.529
 the final frame of each of the cases explained 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.139
 the technical heart the students of the protocol 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.610
 where they are processed by the final images 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.229
 the full-length film 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.879
 here when you are in a finished plane you send the frames to 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.949
 be calculated 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.300
 where each frame consumes approximately between 20 and 30 hours of 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.499
 calculation 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:13.939
 to be generated standing face 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.110
 to the final image to be able 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.289
 Celta and Xabi Prieto these characteristics is to imagine that we have 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.050
 had to close agreements with countless companies 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.050
 with which it costs to do promotions 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.659
 and I end with 'planet 51' 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.300
 the continuity of the study is produced thanks to the second project that we are 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.610
 developing behind response is that it's totally secret for two 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.860
 years 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.309
 min and I feel a bit pioneers of this new conquest 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:43.499
 of the americas trying to convince that we are capable of doing great 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:46.180
 projects with big budgets 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.770
 what can compete with the best American productions any kind of 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.169
 complex
