00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.390
 I dream of the day when I entered a 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.940
 disco that I put some song of 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.530
 hillary that disney game has never 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.019
 gone still but good I trust that 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.920
 one day today I'm going to talk about my 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.920
 favorite songs 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.980
 in the 10th position we have to there is not a 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.660
 so great genius of one of my 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.619
 Disney's favorite characters are 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.619
 Mrs. masquerades 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 in number 9 we have the cycle of 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.460
 life of the region in the friend song of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.430
 lion king who is in this top 10 there is more 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.470
 what life 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.470
 where others only see abroad 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.720
 and what's wrong 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 Well, they always threw me more 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.320
 songs more serious than the most 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 fun and this song is like very 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 would be with measure more than black earth 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.400
 in number 8 we have if only 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.190
 I could be 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.350
 they did not see things like he does 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:27.689
 that you want to call later, I will not be able to see 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.189
 I love underwater things and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 in fact in my room I have it full 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.790
 of shells and starfish and everything 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 that and since childhood he has taken a lot 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.650
 darling this song because I had wanted 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 out I wanted to enter the number 7 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.149
 my favorite Disney movie appears 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.820
 pocahontas and the song colors in the 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.240
 wind I remember having sung in the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240
 school 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.310
 without thinking 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.250
 and a movie and by extension some 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.590
 songs are so mature adults and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.090
 with so much wisdom and I do not know about 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.790
 small that I always have a very eye 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.119
 adult but was a little guy because no 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.129
 I know I got caught this movie and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.170
 and well, it made me grow in a certain way 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.849
 at number 6 we have a song with 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110
 a lot of power are the muses and that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.500
 skill that has to take the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.500
 black 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.970
 but he is champion 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.350
 l 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.970
 the number 5 we have a very song 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.709
 short and it lasts only a minute but they are 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.510
 some rules of a song that comes out 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.269
 before the same movie a track 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.569
 you imagine my last name has almost 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.680
 the me the woman of being worth was stupid 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 you know what is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.450
 beautiful adventure 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.450
 It is my hope and my hope 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.280
 and at number 4 reaches a song 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.880
 really special for me down the river 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.880
 of pocahontas 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 friends 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.180
 and life in front of the TV I thought 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.220
 a very liberating song and like me 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.320
 I support you with jacks because this song 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.500
 she was struggling to take the road 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.000
 sure and marry coconut or choose to 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.950
 jane smith in addition there is another reason 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.200
 special why this song is so 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.630
 important to me and is that recently 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.100
 I started taking singing classes with the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.900
 bending machine of pocahontas with which 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940
 He sang all the songs suddenly 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.040
 I close my eyes and I have her in front of me and I 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.080
 is singing down here is the real one 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.730
 pocahontas is that it is very strong and I 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.620
 I seem to be inside of me 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.600
 favorite movie and well let's go 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.070
 already in the top 3 and the song that comes 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.360
 more energy gives me that they put me in a 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.360
 an iconic humor 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 I will say a shame that they treat you only 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.530
 for a song then 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.000
 if this were a top and then 11 would be 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.069
 one of the safest because it has a 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.290
 original soundtrack is called son of 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.300
 man and good this song has the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.020
 better use of a xylophone and all the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.020
 music history 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:25.120
 a boy who is exporting me 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:28.919
 about I'm not getting to the end 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.919
 I do not care which 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.940
 eager to make a cobra this 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.099
 song 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.490
 and finally we get to number one then 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.159
 will be to any of the relay or not some of 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.470
 aladdin not some of the book of silk 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.050
 we do not have anything an old castle 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.630
 baroque in france where you see is already 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.700
 deciding what to give him 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.340
 and decides to give him whatever is more 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:58.199
 like what are the books 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.370
 those who count the ink sirens 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:06.610
 reindeer Mary light any word is a 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.909
 I dream that with all 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.849
 far away 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.529
 small as pretty the song of all 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.389
 the songs because he has all the magic 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.159
 and all the fantasies of all 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.969
 disney tales condensed into just 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.289
 two minutes 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.610
 as a child I had a comment and 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.189
 Nervous seeing and listening to this 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.899
 song and it's a pity that people do not 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.969
 I knew I knew her more people but 

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:30.039
 good today you and the unknown and 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.929
 also sure that many of some of 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.699
 you already knew her before and these are 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:35.919
 my 10 songs I'm sure that 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.389
 now there will be many people outrageous 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.459
 in front of their screens because they do not 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.959
 included in your favorite song or because 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.899
 they think our songs are a lot 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.819
 better than you are 10 but good each one 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.169
 we have a heart and a way of seeing 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.669
 things and this is mine 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.889
 Of course you have all the songs 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.649
