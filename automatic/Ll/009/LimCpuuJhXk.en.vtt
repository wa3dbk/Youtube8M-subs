Jacqueline<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> was<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.430> even<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> scene

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Jacqueline so it was not even a scene

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
Jacqueline so it was not even a scene
where<00:01:15.180> you'll<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.570> lot<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> movement<00:01:16.259> it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
where you'll see lot of movement it's

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
where you'll see lot of movement it's
basically<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> scene<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.060> guess<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.810> works

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
basically a scene where I guess it works

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.740 
basically a scene where I guess it works
because<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.530> couple<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> its<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.450> top<00:01:21.450> angle

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
because of couple of its long top angle

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
because of couple of its long top angle
shots<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.590> close-ups<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> emotion
