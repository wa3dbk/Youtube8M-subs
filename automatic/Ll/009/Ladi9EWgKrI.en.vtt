going to tell you what limited knowledge

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.089 
going to tell you what limited knowledge
I<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> him<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:31.289> theories<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.920> his

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I have of him and my theories about his

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.770 
I have of him and my theories about his
existence<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.890> origins<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.480> go

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
existence and origins are so here we go

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
existence and origins are so here we go
based<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.290> speculation<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.550> seems<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> me

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
based on my speculation it seems to me

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.440 
based on my speculation it seems to me
that<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.930> lich<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.700> some<00:00:41.700> sort<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.059> ancient

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that the lich is some sort of ancient

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.650 
that the lich is some sort of ancient
warlock<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:44.399> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:45.300> powerful

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
warlock or some kind of very powerful

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
warlock or some kind of very powerful
wizard<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.379> has<00:00:46.590> been<00:00:47.039> living<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> very

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
wizard that has been living for a very

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
wizard that has been living for a very
long<00:00:47.940> time<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.690> that's<00:00:49.020> essentially

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
long time because that's essentially

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.540 
long time because that's essentially
what<00:00:49.649> witches<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:51.230> medieval<00:00:52.230> lore

he had to have done something very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.590 
he had to have done something very
terrible<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> venture<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.210> series<00:01:06.570> to

theories<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.430> he<00:01:14.880> must<00:01:15.090> have

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
theories on what I think he must have

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
theories on what I think he must have
been<00:01:15.299> done<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.170> gotten<00:01:16.439> sealed<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
been done to have gotten sealed up like

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.899 
been done to have gotten sealed up like
that<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.240> believe<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.229> he<00:01:19.890> may<00:01:20.700> have

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that for one I believe that he may have

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
that for one I believe that he may have
liked<00:01:21.210> potentially<00:01:22.110> destroyed<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> tired

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.870 
potentially recreated into some horrible
horrible<00:02:00.590> monster<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.790> least

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
horrible monster and then at least

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
horrible monster and then at least
that's<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.659> cuz<00:02:03.840> didn't<00:02:04.530> make

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
that's what I could see cuz didn't make

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.709 
that's what I could see cuz didn't make
a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.860> sense<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> me<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.570> just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
a lot of sense to me but it was just

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.479 
a lot of sense to me but it was just
there<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.560> okay<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.069> means

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
there and just like okay that means

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
there and just like okay that means
something<00:02:08.970> exposed<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.110> universe<00:02:10.470> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
something exposed for that universe at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740 
something exposed for that universe at
least<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.370> theory<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.910> why<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> think<00:02:12.390> he

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
least the theory as to why I think he

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.949 
least the theory as to why I think he
was<00:02:12.840> healed<00:02:13.050> up<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.500> amber<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.459> he<00:02:15.450> definitely

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
was healed up in amber was he definitely

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.240 
was healed up in amber was he definitely
is<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:17.840> manipulator<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.590> seems<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.099> like

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
is a manipulator because seems that like

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.940 
is a manipulator because seems that like
his<00:02:20.430> magic<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.599> sorcery<00:02:21.900> has<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.680> sort<00:02:22.890> of

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
his magic and sorcery has this sort of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.940 
his magic and sorcery has this sort of
ability<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:24.030> there's<00:02:25.020> evidence<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.680> in

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
ability so there's evidence to that in

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070 
ability so there's evidence to that in
one<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> first<00:02:27.390> episodes<00:02:27.810> he<00:02:27.930> was

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
one of the first episodes he was

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.590 
one of the first episodes he was
revealed

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
revealed

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.450 
revealed
he<00:02:29.690> was<00:02:29.960> controlling<00:02:30.230> thin<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.280> kill

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
he was controlling thin to to kill

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.520 
he was controlling thin to to kill
himself<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:32.270> fin<00:02:32.570> overcame<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.350> power

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
himself and then fin overcame the power

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.860 
himself and then fin overcame the power
and<00:02:33.770> fought<00:02:34.190> back<00:02:34.370> at<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.670> Lich<00:02:34.850> who<00:02:35.630> knows

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and fought back at the Lich who knows

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.210 
and fought back at the Lich who knows
what<00:02:36.230> he<00:02:36.350> could<00:02:36.470> have<00:02:36.590> done<00:02:36.710> with<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:36.920> power

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
what he could have done with that power

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
what he could have done with that power
before<00:02:37.490> fins<00:02:38.330> time<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.840> mean<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.410> could<00:02:39.500> have

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
before fins time I mean it could have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.920 
before fins time I mean it could have
been<00:02:39.650> horrendous<00:02:40.010> because<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.120> commanded

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
been horrendous because I just commanded

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.660

people<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.530> walk<00:02:42.710> off<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> cliff<00:02:43.310> or

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
people to just walk off a cliff or

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.770 
people to just walk off a cliff or
something<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:44.120> something<00:02:44.360> terrible<00:02:44.540> like

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
