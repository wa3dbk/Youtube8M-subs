00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
out of our lives and that's what good

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
out of our lives and that's what good
fiction<00:01:01.590> should<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.059> that's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
fiction should be so and that's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
fiction should be so and that's
something<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.750> human<00:01:04.409> beings<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.830> always

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
something that human beings have always

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
something that human beings have always
wanted<00:01:05.309> they've<00:01:05.820> always<00:01:06.270> had<00:01:06.510> stories<00:01:06.900> told

I'm helping people through my blog but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
I'm helping people through my blog but
I'm<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.030> writing<00:01:48.329> nonfiction<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:49.500> own<00:01:49.590> I'm

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I'm not writing nonfiction my own I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
I'm not writing nonfiction my own I'm
writing<00:01:50.159> fiction<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.030> loving<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
writing fiction and I'm loving it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
writing fiction and I'm loving it
and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.040> part<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> why<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.090> write

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and I think that's part of why we write

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
and I think that's part of why we write
fiction<00:01:54.540> when<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:54.960> write<00:01:55.140> fiction<00:01:55.409> because<00:01:55.860> we

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
fiction when we write fiction because we

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
fiction when we write fiction because we
enjoy<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.119> want<00:01:57.329> other<00:01:57.540> people
