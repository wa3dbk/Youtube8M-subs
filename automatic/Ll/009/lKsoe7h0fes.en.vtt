yeah<00:02:27.959> around<00:02:28.560> 10<00:02:28.709> hours<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.950> felt

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
yeah around 10 hours but I it felt

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.930 
yeah around 10 hours but I it felt
longer<00:02:33.260> why<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.820> was

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
longer why is that I think it was

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.310 
longer why is that I think it was
because<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.510> road<00:02:36.690> at<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.900> altitude

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
because of the road at the altitude

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.760 
because of the road at the altitude
because<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.250> couldn't<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:39.660> i<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.110> at<00:02:40.350> now<00:02:40.500> i'm

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
because I couldn't if i was at now i'm

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.550 
because I couldn't if i was at now i'm
at<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.820> iced<00:02:42.030> i<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:42.989> i<00:02:43.080> could<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.380> run
