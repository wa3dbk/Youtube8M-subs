this<00:02:08.640> gameplay<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.119> me<00:02:09.629> using<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> spec<00:02:10.200> ops

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
this gameplay of me using the spec ops

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.490 
this gameplay of me using the spec ops
kid<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.950> got<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.250> gun<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.819> um<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:13.170> probably

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
kid I got this gun it's um it's probably

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
kid I got this gun it's um it's probably
the<00:02:13.590> kid<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:13.890> I've<00:02:14.010> used<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.280> most<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.790> in

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the kid that I've used the most that in

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.309 
the kid that I've used the most that in
the<00:02:15.209> sniper<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
the sniper and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.929 
the sniper and
in<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.530> sniper<00:02:16.799> kit<00:02:17.370> isn't<00:02:17.549> even<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.909> best

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
in the sniper kit isn't even the best

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.149 
in the sniper kit isn't even the best
but<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.780> just<00:02:19.079> how<00:02:19.319> i<00:02:19.349> roll<00:02:19.499> it's<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.129> i

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
but it's just how i roll it's what i

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.000 
but it's just how i roll it's what i
like<00:02:20.219> to<00:02:20.609> do<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.659> snipe<00:02:21.930> even<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.530> if

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
like to do like the snipe even it if

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.270 
like to do like the snipe even it if
it's<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:25.040> frustrating<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.129> rip

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's like you know so frustrating i rip

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.470 
it's like you know so frustrating i rip
out<00:02:26.459> my<00:02:26.489> own<00:02:27.469> hair<00:02:28.469> I<00:02:28.799> guess<00:02:29.249> I<00:02:29.459> don't<00:02:29.579> know<00:02:29.700> um

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
out my own hair I guess I don't know um

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.910 
out my own hair I guess I don't know um
but<00:02:30.719> yeah<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.019> spec<00:02:31.260> ops<00:02:31.469> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.799> it's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
but yeah the spec ops I think it's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.849 
but yeah the spec ops I think it's
probably<00:02:32.219> the<00:02:32.400> best<00:02:32.670> overall<00:02:33.859> well-rounded

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
probably the best overall well-rounded

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.160 
probably the best overall well-rounded
class<00:02:35.189> that<00:02:35.609> is<00:02:36.120> available<00:02:36.359> event<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.959> honor

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
class that is available event of honor

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.500 
class that is available event of honor

class<00:02:57.840> ability<00:02:58.319> as<00:02:58.439> a<00:02:58.469> signal<00:02:58.949> scan<00:02:59.219> and<00:02:59.489> what

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
class ability as a signal scan and what

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.849 
class ability as a signal scan and what
that<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.389> you're<00:03:00.659> close<00:03:01.019> range<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.739> an

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
that is if you're close range to an

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.129 
that is if you're close range to an
enemy<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.760> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.389> see<00:03:03.810> where<00:03:03.989> they're

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
enemy you kind of like see where they're

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.959 
enemy you kind of like see where they're
at<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.919> I<00:03:04.980> might<00:03:05.189> be<00:03:05.219> doing<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.730> in

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
at like I think I might be doing this in

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.149 
at like I think I might be doing this in
the<00:03:06.030> gameplay<00:03:06.449> of<00:03:06.480> mine<00:03:06.689> right<00:03:06.900> that's<00:03:07.769> yeah

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
the gameplay of mine right that's yeah

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.890 
the gameplay of mine right that's yeah
so<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.549> we<00:03:08.760> hit<00:03:08.909> up<00:03:08.939> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.239> d-pad<00:03:09.480> old

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
so it's like we hit up on the d-pad old

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.920 
so it's like we hit up on the d-pad old
everything<00:03:10.680> don't<00:03:10.829> get<00:03:10.980> really<00:03:11.310> fuzzy<00:03:11.930> it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
everything don't get really fuzzy it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.140 
everything don't get really fuzzy it
won't<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.379> it'll<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.549> point<00:03:14.969> out

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
won't be like it'll kind of point out

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.649 
won't be like it'll kind of point out
where<00:03:15.389> I'm<00:03:16.669> enemies<00:03:17.669> are<00:03:17.849> if<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.419> makes<00:03:18.569> any

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
where I'm enemies are if that makes any

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.710 
where I'm enemies are if that makes any
sense<00:03:18.810> you'll<00:03:19.439> see<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.639> by<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.299> time<00:03:21.509> you're

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
sense you'll see so by the time you're

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.619 
sense you'll see so by the time you're
watching<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.259> the<00:03:22.560> beta<00:03:22.739> has<00:03:23.009> ended<00:03:23.459> um<00:03:23.729> I

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
watching this the beta has ended um I

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.990 
watching this the beta has ended um I
had<00:03:25.259> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.590> fun<00:03:25.829> with<00:03:25.949> it<00:03:26.009> I'd<00:03:26.400> say<00:03:26.669> I<00:03:26.699> got<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
had a lot of fun with it I'd say I got a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.240 
had a lot of fun with it I'd say I got a
few<00:03:27.569> solid<00:03:27.810> hours<00:03:28.229> on<00:03:28.379> there<00:03:28.530> nothing<00:03:28.889> crazy

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
few solid hours on there nothing crazy

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.729 
few solid hours on there nothing crazy
didn't<00:03:29.699> really<00:03:29.879> rank<00:03:30.120> up<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.509> high<00:03:30.689> but<00:03:31.470> you

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
didn't really rank up that high but you

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.229 
didn't really rank up that high but you
know<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:31.859> got<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> decent<00:03:32.370> feel<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.120> game

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
know I got a decent feel for the game

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.670 
know I got a decent feel for the game
and<00:03:33.299> that's<00:03:33.569> really<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:34.049> betas<00:03:34.439> are<00:03:34.470> all

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
and that's really what betas are all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.409 
and that's really what betas are all
about<00:03:34.919> that<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.370> kind<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.639> picking<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.299> the
