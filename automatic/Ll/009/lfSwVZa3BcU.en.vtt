00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.230
 how about friends and then she said yes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.590
 so now let's talk in this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.550
 video of one of the first 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.590
 favorite god that is the h 911 of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 chihuahua so this helicopter we have already 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.399
 talked about four-channel boxes and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.860
 now inside and outside this comes like 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.070
 as it comes here mini with two batteries 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.300
 rechargeable the charger for two 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.989
 Equal batteries are charged by usb 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.989
 and its control of 2.4 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.440
 we are not 10 and pulling out of the box 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.900
 can not see has an aspect of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 shark 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.439
 comes with replacement propellers 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.259
 happy and what is the bar 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.560
 stabilizer in case it will be damaged and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.440
 comes enough to sustain 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.870
 the repairs of the most essential 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.420
 Well, it flies very well 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.340
 referrals has two modes here in the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.060
 control has the one mode that we say 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.510
 which is the beginner mode that gives you a 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 certain percentage of movement of 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.900
 helicopter and mode 2 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.150
 it's more for advanced and it gives you a lot more 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.710
 speed is undertaken back that all 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.010
 the movements 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 and then let's fly it so I can see it 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.950
 let's put one of your batteries 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.090
 These batteries can buy additional 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.890
 they come with two but they still want 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.970
 buy more can have four or five 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 those who like and we have the same unique 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.750
 but nothing else with the orange version 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.420
 it's the same helicopter comes in these 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.590
 two models the model the destroyer 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 shark and the fish- like model 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.349
 then today we are going to proceed to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.950
 to always learn it here monitors 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.980
 we tried all the toys 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.190
 before passing them 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 to the market to see if it works 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.430
 to the new 1 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.170
 the way of life 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.580
 I'm moving 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.440
 with him he ate 3 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.410
 to four channels 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.069
 every movement 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.079
 if you do it 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.079
 how can you see much faster 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.870
 we were watching internet 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.870
 two 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.299
 time stunt 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.299
 and we can do 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.980
 we put mode 1 back and go to 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.980
 try to fly outside 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.980
 Oh 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.330
 in modules 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.360
 very very fast 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.890
 The mode 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.890
 at a lot of speed a lot of agility 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 which ones are preferred then 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.080
 Y 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.950
 above 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.150
 but nothing 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.600
 it's okay 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.920
 do not do much because it has very bad 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.920
 and can not stop outside 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.020
 one of the experiences 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.950
 It was fun also made the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.380
 second step in those who already know how to fly 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.710
 the cost of three channels in the next 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.710
 payment 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.930
 hello very well
