pyromancer elementalists tree here there
are<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> few<00:00:26.220> variations<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.390> tree<00:00:27.779> for

are a few variations on this tree for

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
are a few variations on this tree for
example<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.650> people<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> go<00:00:29.340> into<00:00:29.490> wild

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
example some people like to go into wild

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.590 
example some people like to go into wild
fire<00:00:30.590> because<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.300> three

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

flame bolts unfortunately that is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.020 
flame bolts unfortunately that is
slightly<00:00:37.170> less<00:00:37.559> DPS<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.820> actually

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
slightly less DPS if you're actually

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.869 
slightly less DPS if you're actually
casting<00:00:39.870> those<00:00:40.020> flame<00:00:40.290> bolts<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
casting those flame bolts but you can

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
casting those flame bolts but you can
move<00:00:42.149> while<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:42.660> casting<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.980> it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
move while you're casting them so it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.190 
move while you're casting them so it's
kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.399> based<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> fight<00:00:45.989> you're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
kind of based on on the fight you're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630 
kind of based on on the fight you're
doing<00:00:46.530> whether<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.250> worth<00:00:47.309> getting

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
doing whether or not it's worth getting

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
doing whether or not it's worth getting
that<00:00:48.230> over<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> elementalists<00:00:50.340> tree<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that over in the elementalists tree you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
that over in the elementalists tree you
have<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> choose<00:00:51.300> between<00:00:51.449> three<00:00:51.719> points<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
have to choose between three points and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
have to choose between three points and
charged<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.219> three<00:00:53.460> points<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> ash<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.090> armor

charged or three points in ash and armor

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
charged or three points in ash and armor
I<00:00:54.930> prefer<00:00:55.469> ash<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.070> armor<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I prefer ash and armor and then that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
I prefer ash and armor and then that
would<00:00:57.270> mean<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.600> would<00:00:57.629> keep<00:00:58.020> ignite<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
would mean i would keep ignite on the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.910 
would mean i would keep ignite on the
target<00:00:59.550> with<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> plus<00:01:00.930> fire<00:01:01.410> damage

target with all the plus fire damage

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
target with all the plus fire damage
talents<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.820> from<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> Pyromancer

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
talents that you get from the Pyromancer

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
talents that you get from the Pyromancer
tree<00:01:03.930> ignite<00:01:04.710> actually<00:01:05.159> turns<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
tree ignite actually turns out to be a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.140 
tree ignite actually turns out to be a
decent<00:01:06.030> spell<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:07.890> i<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> point<00:01:08.760> into

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
decent spell now i do go a point into

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.600 
decent spell now i do go a point into
exposure<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> wasted

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
exposure and that is kind of wasted

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
exposure and that is kind of wasted
because<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> raid<00:01:13.170> setting<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.130> that's

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
because in a raid setting that that's

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
because in a raid setting that that's
always<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.330> by<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> different

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
always going to be put up by a different

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
always going to be put up by a different
a<00:01:16.259> different<00:01:16.470> class<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.490> Archon<00:01:18.060> who<00:01:18.240> has

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a different class like Archon who has

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
a different class like Archon who has
the<00:01:18.509> 5-minute<00:01:19.080> debug<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:20.189> much<00:01:20.640> easier

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the 5-minute debug and it's much easier

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
the 5-minute debug and it's much easier
for<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> put<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
for them to put up then for you to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.640 
for them to put up then for you to
refresh<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.100> every<00:01:23.159> 30<00:01:23.520> seconds

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
refresh it every 30 seconds

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.400 
refresh it every 30 seconds
now<00:01:25.190> as<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.550> can<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:25.730> I<00:01:26.030> go<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.630> least<00:01:26.900> 32

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
now as you can see I go at least 32

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.990 
now as you can see I go at least 32
points<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.070> both<00:01:28.190> pilum<00:01:28.580> answer<00:01:28.910> an

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
channel elements I I kind of prefer

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.740 
channel elements I I kind of prefer
having<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:49.070> around<00:01:49.160> anyway<00:01:49.850> because<00:01:50.180> I'm<00:01:50.450> I'm

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
having it around anyway because I'm I'm

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.660 
having it around anyway because I'm I'm
lazy<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.350> don't<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.650> making<00:01:51.950> mana<00:01:52.250> tonics

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.760 
lazy and I don't like making mana tonics
and<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:53.720> other<00:01:53.870> people<00:01:54.050> will<00:01:54.230> argue<00:01:54.440> that

and then other people will argue that
withering<00:01:55.160> flames<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.420> not<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:56.930> not<00:01:57.860> that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
that's that's kind of a debate for a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.200 
that's that's kind of a debate for a
different<00:02:02.810> time<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.380> prefer<00:02:04.340> taking<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:05.000> but

I've<00:02:08.060> been<00:02:08.179> kind<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.450> setting<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:09.020> my<00:02:09.229> bars<00:02:09.619> for

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
I've been kind of setting up my bars for

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.270 
I've been kind of setting up my bars for
this<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.580> pyromancer<00:02:11.740> rotation<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:12.980> its

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.510 

now<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.300> rotation<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.470> fairly<00:03:20.860> simple<00:03:21.190> you

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
now the rotation is fairly simple you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.190 
now the rotation is fairly simple you
want<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.760> keep<00:03:21.850> ground<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.330> power<00:03:22.570> down<00:03:22.900> and

want to keep ground of power down and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.470 
want to keep ground of power down and
then<00:03:24.010> you'll<00:03:24.130> want<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.340> put<00:03:24.490> up<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.700> night<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
looked at a minute ago and then just

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.240

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
keep spamming that until ignite falls

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.500 
keep spamming that until ignite falls
off<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:36.940> you'll<00:03:37.090> switch<00:03:37.210> back<00:03:37.480> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
off and then you'll switch back to

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.500 
off and then you'll switch back to
ignite<00:03:37.990> and<00:03:38.890> then<00:03:39.100> when<00:03:39.460> you<00:03:39.580> get<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.940> full

there you'll want to cast with Riaan
flames<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.530> then<00:03:50.709> you'll<00:03:50.950> get<00:03:51.520> full<00:03:51.970> charge

to use that as soon as your heat wave
where<00:04:34.960> as<00:04:35.050> soon<00:04:35.260> as<00:04:35.380> your<00:04:35.500> intensify<00:04:35.890> elements

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
where as soon as your intensify elements

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.140 
where as soon as your intensify elements
is<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:37.630> off<00:04:38.200> so<00:04:39.010> you'll<00:04:39.160> get<00:04:39.340> actually<00:04:39.730> 30

is is off so you'll get actually 30
seconds<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:41.190> intensified<00:04:42.190> elements<00:04:42.670> which<00:04:42.820> is

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
seconds of intensified elements which is

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.440 
seconds of intensified elements which is
really<00:04:43.240> nice<00:04:44.070> by<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.130> time<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.490> first

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
really nice by the time the first

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.420 
really nice by the time the first
intensify<00:04:47.140> elements<00:04:47.620> wears<00:04:47.800> off<00:04:48.130> you're

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
intensify elements wears off you're

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.850 
intensify elements wears off you're
going<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.670> have<00:04:48.760> full<00:04:49.000> charge<00:04:49.420> again<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.650> for

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
going to have full charge again and for

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.250 
going to have full charge again and for
this<00:04:50.950> I<00:04:51.130> use<00:04:51.160> withering<00:04:52.090> flames<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.870> drain<00:04:53.110> it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
this I use withering flames to drain it

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.930 
this I use withering flames to drain it
off<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.890> withering<00:04:54.160> flames<00:04:54.520> gets<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
off so the withering flames gets the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.750 
off so the withering flames gets the
benefit<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.420> intensified<00:04:56.080> elements<00:04:56.760> you
