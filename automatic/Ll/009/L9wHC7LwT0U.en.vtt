managing<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.240> track<00:01:25.479> was<00:01:25.689> definitely<00:01:26.110> a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
managing the track was definitely a

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
learning curve but something she looked

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.230 
learning curve but something she looked
forward<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.900> a<00:01:28.990> lot<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.200> fun<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:30.240> didn't

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240

really<00:01:31.479> know<00:01:31.600> much<00:01:31.630> about<00:01:31.810> racing<00:01:32.350> let's<00:01:33.130> say

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
really know much about racing let's say

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.370 
really know much about racing let's say
probably<00:01:33.909> in<00:01:34.150> February<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.810> year<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.229> now<00:01:35.350> I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
probably in February this year and now I

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.109 
probably in February this year and now I
think<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.950> know<00:01:36.040> I've<00:01:36.130> learned<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:36.700> much<00:01:36.880> it's

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119
