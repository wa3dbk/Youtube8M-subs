00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.300
 hi to all and the room I hope that 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.279
 you are fine 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.080
 there is an idea that has been submitted to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.090
 rockstar by an American and who in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 course of study it is the dlc of the purge 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 so I'll explain what it is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.500
 but for those who do not know I 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.540
 you put the link of the trailer 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 in the description of the video for 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 really get in the mood is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 well understand this break was going 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.800
 watch the trailer and come back 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.720
 for explanations so purge that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 happens in the united states once a year 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 for 12 hours everything is allowed all 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.429
 what in normal times or will have 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
 trouble with justice really everything and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.850
 legalize that night the police 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 does not intervene hospitals are 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 closed firefighters no longer exists 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.250
 streets are empty during the night of the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 purge each one plays with his own 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 rules its own laws without having to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 fear no punishment 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.789
 so as I told you the streets are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.129
 empty people are transforming their homes 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.239
 in bunker for fear of being attacked and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.770
 only the craziest ones alone 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 psychopaths so that night for 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.489
 satisfy their deepest desires 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 so for a version gta that's what has 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.960
 been proposed no police no matter where 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.579
 you go where do you what the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 forcing kudo is downright abandoned 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 no military inside no 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.170
 people on the streets 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 the only people you can 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.369
 cross will try to kill you from you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 brave to crush you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 afraid or so to run away 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 stores will be invaded by 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.119
 armed civilians is the only way to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 to penetrate to have what you want 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.009
 it's about eliminating everyone 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.000
 inside and take control 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.479
 all the lights in the city were 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.700
 extinguished 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.680
 except for a few here and there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.250
 flashes the street lights come on and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 go out 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
 so we really have a dark night like 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.460
 that of the bottom of the ocean at midnight the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 weapons with low flashlights 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.909
 will finally serve something 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.430
 buying weapons and downright disabled 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.439
 the only way to get this guy 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 special crates that will fall from 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530
 from time to time randomly on the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.990
 map 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 so there are more weapons like the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.630
 club like the chainsaw or so 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 the fire extinguisher that would be especially useful 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 in the apartments you can 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 call someone to deliver your 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.619
 vehicles 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 it's up to you to go get them more 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.950
 need this our apartments for 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.590
 enter go home who you want 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 effect of disavowing anarchy every 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.750
 minutes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.470
 people's points appear on the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.440
 mini map for a second 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.820
 the rest of the time the map is scrambled 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 here only to the integrated emergency systems 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.530
 announcing the beginning of the purge 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.660
 annual when you hear the siren 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.490
 all emergency services will be 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.810
 suspended for 12 hours on 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.200
 government thank you for your 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.200

 they're hiding
