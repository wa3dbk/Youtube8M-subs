onto my stamp positioning tool this is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
onto my stamp positioning tool this is
just<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> clear<00:00:52.980> piece<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.550> plastic

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
just a clear piece of plastic

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
just a clear piece of plastic
positioning<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> want<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> bring<00:00:55.829> back

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
positioning where I want it bring back

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090 
positioning where I want it bring back
my<00:00:56.280> positioning<00:00:56.820> tool<00:00:57.590> take<00:00:58.590> away<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
my positioning tool take away the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
my positioning tool take away the
plastic<00:00:59.670> just<00:01:00.510> slide<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> way<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
plastic just slide it out of the way and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.820 
plastic just slide it out of the way and
then<00:01:02.640> stamping<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.660> image<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> exact<00:01:04.619> same

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
then stamping my image in the exact same

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
then stamping my image in the exact same
position<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.000> allows<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> position

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
position so that allows you to position

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.100 
position so that allows you to position
your<00:01:07.229> stamps<00:01:08.090> your<00:01:09.090> rubber<00:01:09.330> stamps<00:01:09.810> even

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
your stamps your rubber stamps even

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
your stamps your rubber stamps even
though<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> can't<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:11.159> them<00:01:11.340> that's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
though you can't see through them that's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
though you can't see through them that's
why<00:01:11.790> such<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> positioning<00:01:12.600> tool<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
why such a positioning tool is just it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
why such a positioning tool is just it's
absolutely<00:01:14.159> worth<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> investment<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.180> think

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
absolutely worth the investment I think

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
absolutely worth the investment I think
mine<00:01:15.630> cost<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.320> 10<00:01:16.590> euros<00:01:16.979> maybe<00:01:17.340> 12

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
mine cost about like 10 euros maybe 12

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
mine cost about like 10 euros maybe 12
it's<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> lot<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> money<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:19.860> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it's really not a lot of money but if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
it's really not a lot of money but if
you<00:01:20.159> plan<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.460> working<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:20.939> rubber<00:01:21.299> stamps

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you plan on working with rubber stamps

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.499 
you plan on working with rubber stamps
it's<00:01:21.810> absolutely<00:01:22.740> worth<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.000> couldn't

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it's absolutely worth it like I couldn't

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's absolutely worth it like I couldn't
do<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> without<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> spent<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.670> these

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
do it without it so I spent all these

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.749 
do it without it so I spent all these
images<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:28.070> archival<00:01:29.070> black<00:01:29.220> ink<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.549> here

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
images with archival black ink and here

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.280 
images with archival black ink and here
I'm<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.880> winging<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> sentiment<00:01:31.140> because

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
I'm just winging the sentiment because

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
I'm just winging the sentiment because
I'm<00:01:31.590> adventurous<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> didn't<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I'm adventurous like that didn't use the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
I'm adventurous like that didn't use the
positioning<00:01:34.049> tool<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> fortunately<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
positioning tool and fortunately that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.640 
positioning tool and fortunately that
worked<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> numbers<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
worked out here are the numbers of the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
worked out here are the numbers of the
inktense<00:01:38.310> pencils<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.240> using<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.720> my
