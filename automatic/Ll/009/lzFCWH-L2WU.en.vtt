 meal today i will show you how i am 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.439
 I use buckwheat dry buckwheat exactly 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.240
 dry buckwheat here is about 65 grams I'm 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 mostly take one hundred grams at a time 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.320
 here 65 so 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.800
 100 grams run out of 65 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.290
 gram bags we will make here 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.190
 so just cut the dry bag 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.110
 we pour out here sit 60 grams I'm 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.180
 basically take 100 before i tell you what 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.289
 in 100 grams is approximately 65 grams 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.210
 carbohydrate and wash down with water somewhere 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.960
 approximately 4 times more why because 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.469
 that when you are vanity at about 4 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.260
 times more buckwheat swells when you 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.539
 cook them appointed so absorbs 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 in the hotel so I have buckwheat stomach 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.729
 the juice and sucked in the stomach I drink 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.540
 as much water will even need to drink 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.610
 a little more i eat it right now 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 see how this is done quickly and the gap 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 nuance you can knock out kefir with cottage cheese 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.240
 or I will be the side of 180 grams of cottage cheese 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.689
 stirred mixer unwound that you 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.150
 common with the mass like kefir even slurry like 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.740
 milk and 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.439
 eat buckwheat you drink claus 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.920
 180 grams is approximately 30 35 grams of protein 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.229
 and 100 grams of buckwheat about 60 70 grams 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.490
 carbohydrate imagine so was the reception 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.299
 food is very good in quality of food and 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.479
 you will eat for literally for 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.860
 a half to two minutes it's all you now 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 show you how I do it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 look i did with water because 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.340
 cottage cheese I drank literally an hour 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340
 but 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.800
 important thing is not just to go that then do not run 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.800
 do not collect 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.640
 after all , the juice of time has passed 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.230
 I already ate buckwheat guys and got 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.520
 normal can you say long-playing 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.040
 food but advise guys who want even 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.200
 try so who has stomach problems 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.810
 I advise you not even to resort to this method 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.570
 better soak how I started three 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.640
 months ago in the spring of guys I gradually 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.780
 soaked buckwheat first know what you can 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.540
 soak for 10 minutes then 876 3 2 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.760
 one minute and then I already became dry 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.340
 it's about two or three months have passed 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.910
 prepare my body that the sky 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.160
 he took such a river 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.340
 so in our heat yes we have 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.350
 Krasnodar outside the window 35 35 and above 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.910
 constantly degrees in summer is very hard 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.900
 eat especially those who are skinny will understand 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.520
 so try me this way if 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.170
 you will like it but only gradually 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.660
 you get used to not gradually 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.910
 take a lot of your speech 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.760
