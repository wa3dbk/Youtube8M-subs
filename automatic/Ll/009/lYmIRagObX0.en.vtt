know it's metal gear are but then it
turned<00:00:33.180> out<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.750> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.110> an

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
overpriced demo at least that's what the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.290 
overpriced demo at least that's what the
internet<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.020> calling<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.219> today<00:00:39.059> we're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
internet is calling it but today we're

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
internet is calling it but today we're
going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> debate<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.949> to<00:00:41.010> be

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
going to debate that I'm going to be

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
going to debate that I'm going to be
discussing<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:42.809> interesting

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
discussing about a very interesting

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
discussing about a very interesting
topic<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.739> I've<00:00:43.920> been<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.430> thinking

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
topic which I've been actually thinking

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.490 
topic which I've been actually thinking
about<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.120> quite<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.359> while<00:00:45.620> does<00:00:46.620> price<00:00:47.190> equal

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
about for quite a while does price equal

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
about for quite a while does price equal
game<00:00:49.500> time<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.180> what<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.359> means<00:00:51.600> basically

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
game time so what that means basically

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.069 
game time so what that means basically
is<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.309> pay<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> full<00:00:54.359> price<00:00:54.600> game<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
is if you pay for a full price game do

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
is if you pay for a full price game do
you<00:00:55.170> expect<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> hours<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you expect to get a lot of hours out of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.369 
you expect to get a lot of hours out of
it<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.109> mean<00:00:59.120> typically<00:01:00.120> yes<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it I mean typically yes that would be a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
it I mean typically yes that would be a
great<00:01:01.679> thing<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.280> playing<00:01:02.489> our<00:01:02.850> games

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
great thing we like playing our games

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.620 
great thing we like playing our games
but<00:01:03.929> does<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.799> come<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.939> contrast

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
but does that come in you know contrast

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
but does that come in you know contrast
with<00:01:06.810> maybe<00:01:07.020> something<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.590> quality<00:01:08.119> one

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
with maybe something like quality one

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
with maybe something like quality one
perfect<00:01:09.540> example<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> game<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.619> Mirror's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
perfect example is a game like Mirror's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.760 
perfect example is a game like Mirror's
Edge<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:12.600> game<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.020> finished<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
Edge I that game I finished it in like

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
Edge I that game I finished it in like
one<00:01:14.009> sitting<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.610> finished<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.210> four

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
one sitting I finished in like four

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
one sitting I finished in like four
hours<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.930> enjoyed<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
hours but I enjoyed it so much because I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.060 
hours but I enjoyed it so much because I
really<00:01:18.479> loved<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> dynamic<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> gameplay

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
really loved the dynamic of the gameplay

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.069 
really loved the dynamic of the gameplay
was<00:01:20.280> something<00:01:20.640> new<00:01:20.820> fresh<00:01:21.329> I<00:01:21.600> didn't<00:01:21.930> see<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
before that I kept replaying it over and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.830 
before that I kept replaying it over and
over<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:25.049> another<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.520> iko<00:01:27.299> iko

and<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> absolutely<00:01:38.659> enjoyed<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and I absolutely enjoyed it it was so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
and I absolutely enjoyed it it was so
much<00:01:40.950> fun<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.460> even<00:01:42.149> up<00:01:42.240> until<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
much fun that even up until now I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
much fun that even up until now I
occasionally<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.009> play<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
occasionally just go back and play it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.139 
occasionally just go back and play it
for<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.270> finish<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:47.090> do<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
for a bit and just finish it so do you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
for a bit and just finish it so do you
think<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:49.590> applies<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
think that still applies in this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.209 
think that still applies in this
generation<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.969> mean<00:01:51.560> let's<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.100> another

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
generation I mean let's think of another

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.670 
generation I mean let's think of another
example<00:01:53.820> okay<00:01:54.270> yeah<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.810> play<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.469> games

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
example okay yeah we play a lot of games

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.279 
example okay yeah we play a lot of games
like<00:01:56.149> Battlefield<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.479> call<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.810> duty<00:01:58.140> they

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
like Battlefield or call of duty they

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.950 
like Battlefield or call of duty they
are<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.740> short<00:01:59.159> campaigns<00:01:59.759> but<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
are really short campaigns but we get a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
are really short campaigns but we get a
lot<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.200> hours<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> multiplayer<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
lot of hours from the multiplayer you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.709 
lot of hours from the multiplayer you
know<00:02:04.039> another<00:02:05.039> gamer<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
know another gamer I can think of is

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
know another gamer I can think of is
maybe<00:02:06.990> BioShock<00:02:07.950> Infinite<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.730> very

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
maybe BioShock Infinite that was a very

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
maybe BioShock Infinite that was a very
single<00:02:09.390> player<00:02:09.570> focused<00:02:09.780> game<00:02:10.260> but<00:02:10.980> then<00:02:11.100> they

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
single player focused game but then they

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.010 
single player focused game but then they
added<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:11.610> deal

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
added some deal

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.620 
added some deal

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
see that expanded it and made it but you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.740 
see that expanded it and made it but you
had<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.780> pay<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.290> those<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.760> i<00:02:17.300> don't<00:02:17.600> know

it was so friggin short and the worst

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.380 
it was so friggin short and the worst
part<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.700> want<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.970> play<00:03:53.150> on<00:03:53.300> the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
multiplayer you had to have friends and

multiplayer you had to have friends and
and<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.870> more<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.560> was<00:03:58.710> just<00:03:58.890> hoard

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
and and the the more it was just hoard

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.980 
and and the the more it was just hoard
mode<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.760> know<00:03:59.880> something<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.630> get<00:04:00.960> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
see in all multiplayer games it was very

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.510
