00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so and I'm looking forward to that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.129 
so and I'm looking forward to that
because<00:03:19.829> it's<00:03:20.040> kind<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.819> bit<00:03:21.569> more<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:22.019> is

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
because it's kind of a bit more this is

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.319 
because it's kind of a bit more this is
very<00:03:22.319> different<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.129> my<00:03:23.400> other<00:03:23.430> last<00:03:24.090> two

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
very different to my other last two

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.259 
very different to my other last two
features<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.349> it's<00:03:25.769> kind<00:03:26.009> of<00:03:26.069> well<00:03:26.909> you<00:03:27.180> know

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
features so it's kind of well you know

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.819 
features so it's kind of well you know
it<00:03:27.540> makes<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.079> more<00:03:28.259> interesting<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it makes it more interesting and

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.319 
it makes it more interesting and
probably<00:03:29.129> be<00:03:29.189> more<00:03:29.370> challenged<00:03:29.909> and<00:03:30.120> stuff

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
probably be more challenged and stuff

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.530 
probably be more challenged and stuff
