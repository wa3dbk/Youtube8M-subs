in<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.180> area<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.200> ended<00:01:34.920> those

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
in this area right here I ended those

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.620 
in this area right here I ended those
and<00:01:35.430> once<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.670> ended<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.939> those<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.360> gave<00:01:36.479> me<00:01:36.570> a

note play with it a little bit and see
the<00:04:20.599> orientation<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.380> bottom<00:04:21.680> piece<00:04:21.909> this

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
the orientation of the bottom piece this

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.670 
the orientation of the bottom piece this
is<00:04:22.970> offset<00:04:23.599> a<00:04:23.630> little<00:04:23.840> bit<00:04:24.050> from<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.590> is

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
is offset a little bit from that this is

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.730 
is offset a little bit from that this is
actually<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.159> groove<00:04:25.400> that

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
actually the groove that

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.070 
actually the groove that
fit<00:04:25.949> into<00:04:26.099> the<00:04:26.280> door<00:04:26.460> itself<00:04:26.789> my<00:04:27.750> door<00:04:27.960> was

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
fit into the door itself my door was

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.110 
fit into the door itself my door was
about<00:04:28.349> seven<00:04:28.740> o'clock<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.639> noted<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
about seven o'clock so I noted the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.059 
about seven o'clock so I noted the
orientation<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.780> these<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.199> put<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.740> back<00:04:31.889> in

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
orientation of these to put that back in

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.260 
orientation of these to put that back in
there<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:32.520> screwed<00:04:32.789> put<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.120> two

screws<00:04:33.569> in<00:04:33.750> altogether<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.770> probably<00:04:35.039> got

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
screws in altogether I probably got

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.719 
screws in altogether I probably got
about<00:04:35.340> 22<00:04:36.060> mm<00:04:37.050> maybe<00:04:37.680> thirty<00:04:38.039> minutes<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.580> this

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
about 22 mm maybe thirty minutes in this

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.700 
about 22 mm maybe thirty minutes in this
getting<00:04:39.419> in<00:04:39.599> here<00:04:39.690> I've<00:04:39.930> got<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.110> all<00:04:40.289> in<00:04:40.319> it
