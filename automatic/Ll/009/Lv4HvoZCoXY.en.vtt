they see themselves in the character and
we<00:02:42.049> really<00:02:42.320> were<00:02:42.470> hoping<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.430> they

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
we really were hoping for this that they

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.580 
we really were hoping for this that they
would<00:02:43.670> relate<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.329> as<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.660> family<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.470> it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
would relate to that as a family and it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.620 
would relate to that as a family and it
seems<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.950> be<00:02:46.070> happening<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.610> way<00:02:46.820> so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
seems to be happening in that way so

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
seems to be happening in that way so
we're<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:47.989> thrilled<00:02:48.230> about<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:57.400> yeah<00:02:58.400> I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
we're really thrilled about that yeah I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:08.350 
we're really thrilled about that yeah I
think<00:03:03.489> now<00:03:04.489> what<00:03:04.820> would<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.299> for<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:07.360> one

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
think now what would you do for this one

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.520 
think now what would you do for this one
