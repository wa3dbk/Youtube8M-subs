which we've changed regularly to stop
calcification<00:01:00.030> front<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> machine<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
calcification front of the machine it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.569 
calcification front of the machine it's
really<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.010> simple<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> use

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
really really simple to use

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.899 
really really simple to use
this<00:01:03.480> allows<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.530> caps<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.189> mugs

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this allows you to have caps or mugs

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
then by here you've got the program

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
then by here you've got the program
system<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.200> basically<00:01:10.590> allows<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
system which basically allows you to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
system which basically allows you to
change<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> from<00:01:11.790> things<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.210> espresso<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
change it from things like espresso to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.940 
change it from things like espresso to
large<00:01:13.710> coffee<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.490> double<00:01:15.060> expresso<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.950> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
large coffee to double expresso and so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
large coffee to double expresso and so
on<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.610> below<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> gives<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
on and then below it then this gives you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.480 
on and then below it then this gives you
the<00:01:18.689> strength<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> coffee<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the strength of the coffee and then the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.749 
the strength of the coffee and then the
clean<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> calcification<00:01:21.720> function

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
clean and the calcification function

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.609 
clean and the calcification function
this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> drip<00:01:24.150> tray<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.200> removable

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this is the drip tray which is removable

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
this is the drip tray which is removable
which<00:01:25.950> allows<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> easily<00:01:26.490> clean<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
which allows you to easily clean it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.319 
which allows you to easily clean it
comes<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.619> by<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
comes out and then by here you have the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.190 
comes out and then by here you have the
