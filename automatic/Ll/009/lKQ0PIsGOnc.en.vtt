00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.100
Hi guys! Today I'm gonna review the brand new Puma evoSPEED 1.3 gloves

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100
In the DRAGON colorway. Let's go!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.400
The first difference between these and all the other gloves is the wristband absence

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.740
Which is replaced by a sock like wristband

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.760
This technology has been introduced by Puma in 2013 with the evoSPEED 1 glove

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.380
And obviously made goalkeepers curious, which were attracted by this new notable feature

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.900
On the bottom part of the backhand we find the Bio-Mimic Fit

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.420
Which is composed by lots of elastic bands and it is supposed to give a better fit and a great comfort to the hand

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.600
The backhand is made of latex and mesh and is joined to the palm because the glove is made of only one panel of latex

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.760
The latex is german, it is 4mm thick and is the best one used by Puma for the top series gloves and it's called the Ultimate Grip

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:51.600
The cut is hybrid and is made of regular cut on the middle two fingers, and the twin wrap on the thumb and this help you when catching the ball

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.300
Ending this review the Puma evoSPEED are, not only lightweight and comfortable, but also great gloves

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.800
And I suggest them to all of the goalkeepers who want a top glove but that also want to surprise the opponent with a crazy graphic

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.840
But what do you think about these gloves? Let me know right down in the comments!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.980
See you soon!
