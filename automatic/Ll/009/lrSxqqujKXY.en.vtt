00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.440
 Tools for size 

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.065
 Today we will see the clamps for the waist 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.020
 you will see, they are a little strange claws, very different from those used to cut here in Europe 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.740
 They are a bit like pincers 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.760
 these clamps 

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:41.756
 are not very old in fact, 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.260
 they were developed about 90 years ago 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.940
 thanks to the collaboration of two men 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.320
 one who was a blacksmith, whose name was Masakuni 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.160
 and that many of you know through its tools Masakuni very high quality 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.540
 And a friend, the father of one of our friends, 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 Mr. Murata, 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 of which we have often published the works in the magazine France Bonsaï 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.640
 where we were able to explain that he is the oldest bonsaïsta of Japan 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.220
 and at the time, they were looking for a tool that at the same time to carve 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.740
 Dig a little 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.680
 to make the cuts left healed easier 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.140
 that's why they developed this tool 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.220
 which is comparable to a hole punch 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.680
 You notice that there are 2 different tools 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.660
 These are the so-called kuikini tongs, this one is very big 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.740
 In truth we use them very few times 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.640
 the ones we normally use are those, the kobukiri, 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 kobukiri which means puncher. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.100
 And you will see that this tool, normally, has a very precise fit 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.280
 This adjustment is very important 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.740
 that's why we should never 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.940
 force them by opening or closing them 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.300
 especially if you saw the video on the scissors, 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.600
 if the claws become a little hard to open or close, they must be replaced in the same way by giving a little but not forcing 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.400
 because if they get out of order, they will start to badly cut 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
 The cuts made by these tools 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.220
 you see ? this tool digs very well 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.280
 He removes the pieces a little 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 Inside this kind of clamp there are two classes: 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 straight forceps like this 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.520
 and the forceps which are completely rounded, concave. 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.800
 This clip is very good for refining the cuts 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.720
 to be able to adjust them well 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.320
 it penetrates very well, you see? it gives a very well adjusted cut 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.960
 But on the other hand, they are not at the peak and sometimes 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.680
 when you want to carve out a little more complicated place 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.440
 they are not very practical 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 That is two very different tools 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.300
 This one, let's say it's for size in general 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.240
 and this one, more to refine the cuts 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.980
 I do not know if it's good on the video 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.920
 but this tool is a bit mixed tool 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.800
 you see ? 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.662
 it is sharp and sometimes a little rounded 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.900
 he fulfills both missions 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.420
 It's a tool model that professionals love to use 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.340
 because they allow them to dig well the cuts 

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:18.732
 and work very easily 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.020
 As you can see, according to the size of the cuts 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.160
 take the example of this branch that goes through here 

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:32.811
 he cuts it very cleanly 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 they are pliers that cut very well 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.140
 You see ? 

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:44.635
 they do not suffer at all 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.380
 and if we want, for example, to refine the cut that we made, 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.200
 then we will use these tongs, 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.420
 and with these, we will dig a little the cut 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.500
 Then we can protect the cuts so that they heal 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.780
 with healing paste, 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.460
 a paste used so that the wounds do not become infected 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.840
 As you can see, 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 like the last times, 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.580
 there is a range of scissors-pliers which are made of stainless steel, 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.300
 and a range of pruning tweezers that are made of black steel 

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.096
 Normally, 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.460
 Me personally, 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.920
 to cut, I really like the black steel clamps 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.160
 they cut very well, cut very well, they fit very well 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.600
 but where they do not fit well is to dig 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.760
 so I usually use those steel clips that are much harder 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.640
 with these clamps for example we can shorten an old cut 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.340
 You see ? like this here 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.840
 If you observe I do not try to cut everything in one go 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.820
 these pliers cut, piece after piece, 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.480
 not to spoil 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.460
 They cut very well 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.440
 I can already reduce here, what was left of the size, which was so lousy 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 You see ? ...it's quick. 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.240
 That's why I appreciate that these tongs are the hardest possible 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.420
 and I really like to use these stainless forceps when they are concave forceps, concave 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.700
 Another important detail is how to sharpen the tongs 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:54.500
 The inner part of these clamps almost never dulls, because the lower blade taps into the upper one, so that they sharpen almost between them 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:56.869
 anyway, 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.920
 for sharpening, we always do this, very gently until the tip 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.000
 You must never try 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680
 to sharpen from the inside because it would damage them 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.340
 It is very simple. 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.460
 As you can see, it's a very practical tool, 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.400
 it is very different from the size tools that we usually use in Europe 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:35.380
 it allows, as you see, to leave cuts that will heal very well 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.840
 it is very good, because it allows the bonsai, to recover very quickly wounds of the size that we make them.
