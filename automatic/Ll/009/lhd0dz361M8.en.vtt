00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.280
 and very cross 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.240
 Welcome to the live here I bring you 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.680
 another tutorial this time how to do 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.440
 Bunk beds is not a very complicated thing 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.090
 but as I tell you I like to share 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.369
 this kind of thing with you for 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.570
 give you new ideas for houses like this 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.830
 How good are we going to do? 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.830
 do it from top to bottom just like 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.750
 we did with the fence columns and 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.279
 let's put the first bed then 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.830
 let's go breaking the blocks and so 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 successively worth it is a pretty thing 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.960
 easy but I for example is not that not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.150
 I've never tried and I entered ago 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.379
 little that can be done and the truth is 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.790
 that for a guest house a 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.949
 guest room or something for the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.720
 style can serve us and is very very 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.129
 easy to do as I tell you and you see the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.979
 result the truth that is enough 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.479
 well and you can sleep peacefully what 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.659
 only tell you that you have to respect a 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.920
 little space at least in height 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.260
 why 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 if you see when we get up 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 we left standing upright if you do not leave much 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.250
 hollow in the top bed with the roof 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.110
 will give you a little problem when it comes to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.850
 get up you will be caught in the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.470
 blocks so well just be 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.080
 can do leaving that space in the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.460
 upper zone as I tell you and well the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.409
 It's true that we've made a little house 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.600
 test to see what you see there JCE 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.580
 how it works and just give the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.890
 thanks to the mountain that has 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.200
 I helped make this tutorial and good 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 I just wanted to share it with 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.759
 you so you know that you can 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.990
 do and it's a pretty curious thing to 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.090
 least I've been called enough by the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 attention and it's a different way of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 put several beds instead of stacking 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.569
 one next to another you know for the people 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.640
 that comes online and your friends and 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.229
 those things then you can do this 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.700
 type of bunk beds in a very room 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.069
 small there may be a lot of beds 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.240
 in the form of a bunk and the truth is that I 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.770
 He liked it a lot, that's why he wanted 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.049
 share it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.899
 I hope you like it and it serves you 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.670
 utility you see try to make 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.799
 tutorials that give you new ideas and 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.539

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.670
