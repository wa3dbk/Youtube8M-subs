00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.869
 hello welcome on this occasion I will 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.759
 making a recipe is very tasty and very 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.039
 Mexican that is going to be some flutes 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.710
 accompanied with their respective legs 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.090
 By porc 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.969
 this as you see here I already have the legs 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 of pork in water and what I'm going to 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.550
 putting those little feet is a piece of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.570
 onion and salt 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 these are going to leave seething 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.790
 about an hour and a half and there's 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.980
 that try to not be well 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.010
 We love you a little bit more 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 firm that are not falling off the bone 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.519
 so you have to be checking them 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.210
 I have this is about one pound 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.090
 and a half of meat to plant 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.979
 anyone 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.289
 in our ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.770
 put we are going to cook this meat 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.490
 with a step of onion about three years 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.520
 about four or five balls of pepper 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.759
 what are these a spoonful of consommÃ© 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.390
 but this is consumed of beef two or two 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.850
 leaves laurel girls and salt 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.429
 we also occupy the tomatoes because this 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.130
 the flutes and the pig's legs are going 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.579
 to be both accompanied with a sauce 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.670
 of tomato and we get these 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.090
 tortillas that are a little smaller 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.340
 and more skinny than we have for 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.489
 make our plants so that we 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.200
 come out the other little ones then that 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.959
 is what we are going to do now 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.299
 to sew our as I said is our 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.030
 meat and our pork legs 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.399
 two about an hour and a half 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.369
 but then you have to be checking and 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.190
 then we are going to show you what 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.550
 more let's continue doing with our 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.850
 our practices and all that then 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.300
 after one approximately one passed 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.090
 hour and a half and our little legs already 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.600
 were left long now what I'm going to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.300
 to do is take them out of here from the caldito and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.950
 I will also reserve our meat 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.300
 is already cooked what in this 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.340
 moment 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.740
 I'm going to do is to take out the meat I'm going to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.230
 strain this caldito so that it stays 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.840
 everything that is being what it is 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.510
 we put the onion the garlic that then 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.630
 right here in the broth after casting 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.560
 let's get to know our tomatoes and with 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.020
 we are going to liquefy this same water 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.390
 that is what is going to give flavor to our 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.690
 tomato sauce that we are going to use also 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.270
 We are going to reseed our meat and go 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.660
 to make our flutes and we're going to 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.660
 fry 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.390
 Y 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.480
 ah 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.450
 they saw and fry our flutes 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.330
 here are our little legs 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.780
 one thing to say is that once the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.030
 tomato sauce and left bajita 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.270
 the fire because you are closing in the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.760
 flutes and on the legs so warm 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.470
 then you have to leave it normal 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.970
 short that is in the fire 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.090
 the first thing we are going to do is rather 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.020
 put our paws 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.020
 to put a sea 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.650
 all of you two pork legs like that 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.650
 we will accompany them 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.530
 that we put our two little legs 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.860
 then we are going to put these 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.719
 quotes 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.100
 well easy to do we're going to put 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.430
 only to above 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.550
 they are accompanied 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.700
 and in our fruits we are going to put the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.390
 cabbage above 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.130
 and then we're going to bathe with the same 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.910
 salsita that we go our practices 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.910
 By porc 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.189
 quite because these little plants like that go 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.039
 with that sauce the sauce is what 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:40.840
 it makes you very different if well 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:44.080
 tasty so we use them to eat and 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.689
 in this case I have a little salty 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.770
 tree chili that is already in me is my 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.710
 channel this sauce 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.919
 this is for if they want to give it a little 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.190
 of spicy or also accompany it with 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.880
 fruits 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.880
 pickled 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.110
 Well, I do not know if it was easy for them 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.689
 but hopefully they try it and they do it because 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.330
 if it comes out tasty 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:15.009
 I hope this recipe you have made 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:18.459
 very easy because I think it is 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.199
 everyone who comes out this tasty food 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:24.869
 that we are left behind our flesh 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.869
 tasty because it's the one we accompany 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.920
 I hope it has been to your liking 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.640
