00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I was a person and I will not talk again 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.410
 in this video because I talked to the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.300
 my friend, teacher cynthia said 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 and she told me that it makes little sense 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.730
 I speak new video being that week that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 come this video is not new but it will not 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.230
 take another sentence to get the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.230
 videos should be just the person 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.240
 Good how you promised this video is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.150
 about the room and a lot of time I 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.230
 I wanted to do my room at all stop 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.930
 crate 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 I waited for us to change to do 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 because otherwise it was not worth it in the other 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.130
 house had a fourth goal done under 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 As it would be the size of my room was 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.440
 very small there was never anything nor 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 Right then I could not do for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 there for you because you had nothing to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.090
 show is too small 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 the first thing I did when 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 decided to make my room all in the box 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.380
 Part of you will find a company here. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 in curitiba that did this service I 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.180
 I found the company or here I think 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 here in the video description the site to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 would you give me wanted because I wanted to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 the new boxes would not give 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.020
 because they come with 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.570
 a new and wet fruit peeler 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 ideally some of these 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 Very thin wood is just a raffle and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.119
 it does not work because I wanted to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.240
 do 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.670
 so I preferred to buy the new material 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 I spent more or less in my room. 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.539
 all set because the boys 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.910
 They set me up for this too, which I do not 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.539
 I'm a carpenter I would not know how to install 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.600
 this here I practically thousand reais a 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.610
 a little more maybe the table but me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.950
 I did not buy with them at the table I bought 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.229
 in the street riachuelo here in curitiba that is 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.259
 a street that has several furniture stores and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.330
 used property and sells straw material 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.179
 which also sells pine material and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.520
 reforestation wood and the 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.959
 I used my box even had a 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.630
 box bed 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.459
 It's just that change has come about and I have not 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.120
 I wanted more to use, I would do it for you. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.700
 same 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.250
 So I preferred to take that fabric away then 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 using the bed's own box I arrived 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.080
 a bit of peace in 2000 he was show of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.740
 ball and I'm using now can see 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 all are composed to make my 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.680
 room I used 12 crates of 80 per 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 38 puppies 40 by 30 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 the tv panel has 80 eighty and one tv 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.290
 32-inch was not right on the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.719
 wall 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'm in love with my bedroom so the 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.560
 My tip for anyone who is thinking of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.390
 make a sustainable pact using the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.090
 crate to have and everything 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.359
 search long before not using wood 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.519
 old in the wet wood because you 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.769
 It will only bother you once you have 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.459
 remind you to wear clothes for your 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.859
 personal objects and the intention is that 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.629
 it really works as a wardrobe 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.209
 or works with the shelf 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.889
 if you put a rotten thing after the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.939
 screw it up you know that 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.939
 Manpower to do it again 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.600
 so you could see and maybe three 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.990
 Some people's plans 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.780
 I do not have a face look me right 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.729
 Because I cycle my clothes a lot today 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.530
 My clothes things I do not use but I 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.840
 I do not like it, I'll do it, I will not 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.870
 accumulating pants type accumulating to marry 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.880
 I do not like it, but the name is vi 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.800
 because I do not buy clothes present 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.229
 now the clothing bag depends on my ford 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.970
 to you who have already asked me to do 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.580
 about video games I'm going to make videos about 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.010
 video files on my dvds do not 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.940
 make the service dolls videos 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.729
