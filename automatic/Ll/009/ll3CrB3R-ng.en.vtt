00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.930
 hello everyone and I still keep 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.400
 good and let's go with the maxi hysteria 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.320
 but first I'm going to tell you that since it was my 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.029
 birthday, well, there's nothing there 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.849
 invited a couple of subscribers to stay 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.200
 at random and have been being 64 and andress 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.390
 moore that from here I send a greeting 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.130
 and I hope they happened just as 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.440
 well that my review friend does not 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.599
 we have spent with them then now what 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.310
 what we are going to do is make the easter 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.590
 also and step by step 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.450
 We are here in the elevators 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 we had to do both the four to the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.040
 so much time to put the circle on 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 the sensors like on the ground but like 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 we have already done this in the part of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 ristov in this part we are not going to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.100
 jump and now let's go to the next 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.100
 part the next part would be first 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 ride the catapults then what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 we're going to do the catapult every 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.850
 one of the classmates is going to take his 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.230
 own catapult and now I for example 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 I'm going to put it here so we can 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.770
 access the other side is worth no 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 problem to the companions that makes you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.220
 we need to go there because we only wanted to 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.220
 now we continue with these 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.470
 perfect now we catch the balls that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.470
 It is not necessary 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.360
 the illuminated one is rushman the black 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.079
 and now we're going in the buddha 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 directly and that is what we are going to do 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.920
 step by step everything that the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.479
 so now we come here and we're going to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.649
 be killing zombies until he us 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 talk again once again yes 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.660
 more blood then we have to continue 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.790
 killing zombie or death until we 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.750
 talk again and again then 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 then what we do is that the manna 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.700
 will stop dying for the zombies and then 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.700
 already 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.990
 what reincarnation is saying 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.360
 then what we are going to do will be left 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.030
 die for the zombies when he says it and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.060
 then already the partner with the knife 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.099
 improved ballistics will receive it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.209
 and it is what will do now 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.030
 then he already has the knives 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.860
 prepared ballistic and then now 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.650
 he's going to let himself go let him kill for the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.349
 zombies and now is when it's going to 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.160
 revive and then now again more 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.160
 without talking again 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.970
 I will return you 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.050
 in this day 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.730
 perfect now we're going to go with the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.390
 catapults each to your site and I'm going to 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390
 show where they are 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.720
 then one will be on this site with his 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.110
 with his catapult on that site and looking 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.790
 the catapult towards the tower 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.030
 perfectly placed because if not you will not 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.030
 will talk more and if it is not well placed 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.490
 the second would be that in this site 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.470
 it also has to be perfectly 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.330
 because it is looking for all that rivals 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.450
 It is super important because if it does not 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.810
 fail then we go to the next one that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.080
 it would be here we would put it and it is what 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.080
 I say 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.560
 perfect you see that's how you have to 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.930
 talk then like this would be well put 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.200
 then this would be the last you see 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.020
 if it does not get well put it does not talk to you 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.880
 but good after putting colleagues and 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.700
 perfect then now what we would do 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.640
 is directly synchronizing my 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.740
 partner and I and now we would be the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.080
 balls I have a dragon and he has 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.480
 another and we would put the two balls to the 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.000
 time in catapult 12 I get ready 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.980
 here with him and we count to 3 and nothing 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.840
 that we have 3 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:24.790
 1 2 and 3 we throw them 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.790
 and it would be from the tower ready 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.800
 it would begin to illuminate 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.740
 and it already means that the tower is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 ready to do the synchronization 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.170
 you see 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.420
 the tower is already on then 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.880
 once the tower is turned on and the only thing 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.570
 What we have left is to come here to put us 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.220
 to look at the cards and count them all 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.550
 letters or chips as you want to count them 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.310
 all by color and by number of that 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.510
 have each one and then we come 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.000
 here and we make the combination that has 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.710
 come out that depends on how the game 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.530
 that it will be a combination u 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.810
 another then we did it like that 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.560
 ok then we paste the four points 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.010
 that has touched us 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.120
 and it has been achieved by people and has even been 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.210
 easy 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.419
 gentlemen this would be all I hope you have 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.490

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.260

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.840
