Deere<00:00:09.690> 210<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.469> uh<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.429> lights<00:00:11.700> didn't<00:00:12.150> work

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
Deere 210 and uh the lights didn't work

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.720 
Deere 210 and uh the lights didn't work
on<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.990> here's<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.500> did<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.009> went<00:00:14.580> ahead

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
on it so here's what I did I went ahead

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.310 
on it so here's what I did I went ahead
and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.059> cleaned<00:00:15.299> all<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> connections<00:00:16.109> such

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and I cleaned all the connections such

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620 
and I cleaned all the connections such
as<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.859> down<00:00:17.039> there<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.210> know<00:00:18.330> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
as that one down there and you know just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
as that one down there and you know just
all<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.199> connections<00:00:19.650> along<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.010> line<00:00:20.220> then

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
all the connections along the line then

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.599 
all the connections along the line then
um<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.090> took<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:22.410> wires<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.160> were<00:00:23.279> running

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
um I took these wires that were running

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
um I took these wires that were running
to<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> existing<00:00:24.359> switch<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.320> hooked

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to the existing switch and I hooked

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
to the existing switch and I hooked
those<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:26.130> directly<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> battery<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> see

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
those up directly to the battery to see

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.599 
those up directly to the battery to see
if<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> lights<00:00:28.410> came<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> sure<00:00:29.580> enough

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
if the lights came on and sure enough

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
if the lights came on and sure enough
one<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> them<00:00:30.269> came<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> thought<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
one of them came on so I thought that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
one of them came on so I thought that
was<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.830> switch<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.460> bad<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.480> ahead

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
was my switch that was bad so I go ahead

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
was my switch that was bad so I go ahead
and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.989> went<00:00:34.200> out<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> bought<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and I went out and just bought it to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
and I went out and just bought it to
post<00:00:35.370> switch<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.030> hooked<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.540> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
post switch and then I hooked it up my

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
post switch and then I hooked it up my
lights<00:00:37.350> were<00:00:37.530> working<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.309> being

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
lights were working for the time being

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.180 
lights were working for the time being
now<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.059> don't<00:00:39.239> work<00:00:39.480> home<00:00:39.809> even<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> had

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
now they don't work home even when I had

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
now they don't work home even when I had
those<00:00:41.430> wires<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.660> know

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
those wires on there so I don't know

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
those wires on there so I don't know
what's<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.800> uh<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.640> not

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what's up with that but uh that's not

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
spark so um I don't know you know what's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.499 
spark so um I don't know you know what's
going<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.119> I'm<00:01:12.330> thinking<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> two<00:01:13.110> things

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
going on I'm thinking one of two things

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.120 
going on I'm thinking one of two things
ignition<00:01:15.509> switch<00:01:16.610> or<00:01:17.610> coil<00:01:18.680> now<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
ignition switch or coil now I just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
ignition switch or coil now I just
wanted<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> guys<00:01:20.850> his<00:01:21.060> opinion<00:01:21.450> um

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
like a loose connection or somewhere

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
like a loose connection or somewhere
that<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> guys<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.310> familiar<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.700> um<00:01:27.299> also

that you guys are familiar with um also
the<00:01:28.200> spark<00:01:28.650> plug<00:01:28.979> boot<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.939> doesn't<00:01:30.299> seem<00:01:30.450> like

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the spark plug boot it doesn't seem like

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
the spark plug boot it doesn't seem like
it's<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.350> snug<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.430> it
