00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.096
My God!
Right out of Dante's Inferno.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.281
The most destructive force in the universe.
Nothing can escape it, not even light.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.790
Welcome aboard the Cygnus.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.490
Tonight, my friends...

00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:06.292
we stand on the brink of a feat
unparalleled in space exploration.

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:11.993
If the data on my returning probe ship
matches my computerized calculations...

00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:15.694
I will travel where
no man has dared to go.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:18.295
Into the black hole?

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:20.495
In...

00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:22.996
through...

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:25.996
and beyond.

00:01:27.597 --> 00:01:29.097
Why, that's crazy.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:31.998
Ha! Impossible!

00:01:32.298 --> 00:01:38.199
The word "impossible," Mr Booth,
is only found in a dictionary of fools.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.500
a place where,
if you're lucky...

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.301
I'll have the possibility to find what
we call "the ultimate knowledge."

00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:46.801
Yes, Maximilian?

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:52.302
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.904
"And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:02.555
And the spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters."

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:04.555
The risk is incidental
compared to the possibility...

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:06.306
to possess the great truth
of the unknown.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:12.807
There, long-cherished
laws of nature simply do not apply.

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:15.408
And life?

00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:18.308
Life?

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:21.609
Life ?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.110
Life forever.

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.812
Protect me from Maximilian.

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:38.313
If there's any justice at all,
the black hole will be your grave.

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:50.816
Maximilian !

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:53.817
Help me !

00:02:57.317 --> 00:02:58.518
All light.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.119
Hang on! Lift-off!
