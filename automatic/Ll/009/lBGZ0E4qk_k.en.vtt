 from you I realized that you wanted this 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.969
 will come to an end when two people will 

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:53.219
 they call to fight until the impossible but already 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.229

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.950
 leave and to pretend that I love 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.440
 and that you love me too I go to the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.479
 roles in this relationship can no longer be 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 every day more lies every day more 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.560
 distrust I can not continue like that

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.850
 returned a failure in what we are 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.790
 waiting for us to tell once let me go 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.860

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.380
 fantasy world and colors passed the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
 time and we pretend to be older when 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.340
 you are going to visit us you felt with 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.720
 Enthusiasm The love that we had was 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.580
 completely false 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.130
