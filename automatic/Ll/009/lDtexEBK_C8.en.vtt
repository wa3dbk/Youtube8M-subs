00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.499 
treatment we're going to hang it over
the<00:00:08.610> cone<00:00:09.570> drug<00:00:09.839> that<00:00:09.990> we've<00:00:10.169> got<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:10.619> and

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
the cone drug that we've got here and

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.390 
the cone drug that we've got here and
we're<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.599> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.499> piece<00:00:14.339> of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
we're just going to use a piece of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.570 
we're just going to use a piece of
fabric<00:00:14.730> 54<00:00:15.360> inches<00:00:16.049> wide<00:00:16.350> any<00:00:16.830> width<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
fabric 54 inches wide any width of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.210 
fabric 54 inches wide any width of
fabric<00:00:17.730> within<00:00:18.240> reason<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.350> 48<00:00:19.860> inches

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
fabric within reason so it's 48 inches

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.900 
fabric within reason so it's 48 inches
wide<00:00:20.490> 60<00:00:20.970> inches<00:00:21.390> wide<00:00:21.450> should<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.140> fine<00:00:22.910> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
wide 60 inches wide should be fine and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.090 
wide 60 inches wide should be fine and
the<00:00:24.600> length<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> fabric<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.650> all

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
the length of the fabric is all

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.990 
the length of the fabric is all
determined<00:00:26.790> by<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.570> wide<00:00:27.870> your<00:00:28.080> window<00:00:28.440> is

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
determined by how wide your window is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
determined by how wide your window is
from<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.690> and<00:00:31.200> how<00:00:31.800> far<00:00:32.129> down<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
from here to here and how far down on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.099 
from here to here and how far down on
each<00:00:33.360> side<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> fabric<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.129> come<00:00:35.519> in

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
each side you want the fabric to come in

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.729 
each side you want the fabric to come in
this<00:00:37.109> example<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:38.039> going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.339> help<00:00:38.550> offset

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
this example we're going to help offset

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
this example we're going to help offset
so<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:40.859> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.039> have<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> right-hand

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
so we're going to have the right-hand

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
so we're going to have the right-hand
side<00:00:43.679> about<00:00:44.100> 20<00:00:44.609> inches<00:00:44.789> deep<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:46.170> the

spreading roughly at the same height

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.340 
spreading roughly at the same height
that's<00:03:45.970> assuming<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.690> want<00:03:46.900> both<00:03:47.110> the

the sides of the window so that's the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.840 
the sides of the window so that's the
the<00:03:52.120> next<00:03:52.420> step<00:03:52.630> our<00:03:53.020> next<00:03:53.739> step<00:03:53.920> after<00:03:54.520> this

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
the next step our next step after this

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.500 
the next step our next step after this
now<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.720> dress<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:57.010> swag<00:03:57.280> into<00:03:58.030> shape<00:03:58.270> so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
from moving and just gently put bit by

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.820 
from moving and just gently put bit by
bit<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.840> see<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.169> pleats<00:04:39.470> sort<00:04:39.740> of

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
bit and you can see the pleats sort of

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.430 
bit and you can see the pleats sort of
separating<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.300> that's<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.930> effect<00:04:42.229> we're

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
separating so that's the effect we're

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.379 
separating so that's the effect we're
aiming<00:04:42.590> for<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.750> eventually<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:46.100> can<00:04:46.400> hide

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
aiming for and eventually you can hide

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.140 
aiming for and eventually you can hide
the<00:04:47.660> entire<00:04:48.050> top<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.620> rod<00:04:48.889> with<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.850> top

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
the entire top of the rod with the top

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.020 
the entire top of the rod with the top
plate<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:51.280> it's<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.550> matter<00:04:52.699> of<00:04:52.820> just
