cheese three simple ingredients so let's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
cheese three simple ingredients so let's
get<00:00:17.640> started<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.779> our<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:18.990> step<00:00:19.290> get

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
get started so for our first step get

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.820 
get started so for our first step get

of your water and just start whisking

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.300 
of your water and just start whisking
that<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> there's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> debate<00:00:28.310> using

that up so there's a lot of debate using

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.720 
that up so there's a lot of debate using
water<00:00:29.609> versus<00:00:30.300> milk<00:00:30.539> both<00:00:31.349> chefs<00:00:31.740> will<00:00:32.580> use

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
water versus milk both chefs will use

want a little bit more nutrition so once

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
want a little bit more nutrition so once
that's<00:00:41.910> nicely<00:00:42.210> whipped<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:43.230> ready<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
going I've got a medium heat going here

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
going I've got a medium heat going here
I'm<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:49.710> bit<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> oil<00:00:50.129> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and you don't want your heat to high you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
and you don't want your heat to high you
know<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.580> nice<00:01:11.849> medium<00:01:12.270> heat

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.770 

and<00:01:15.520> at<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.729> point<00:01:15.940> I<00:01:16.119> just<00:01:16.150> want<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.600> have

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.700 
and at this point I just want to have
the<00:01:17.380> egg<00:01:17.650> just<00:01:18.610> get<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> little<00:01:19.990> bit<00:01:20.110> browned<00:01:20.409> on

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
the egg just get a little bit browned on

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.039 
the egg just get a little bit browned on
the<00:01:20.799> bottom<00:01:21.250> now<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:21.820> see<00:01:22.119> there's<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.420> lot<00:01:22.750> of

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
the bottom now you see there's a lot of

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.859 
the bottom now you see there's a lot of
liquid<00:01:23.530> on<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.430> top<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:25.330> what<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.540> want<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.780> do

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
liquid on the top so what you want to do

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.359 
liquid on the top so what you want to do
is<00:01:26.049> you<00:01:26.140> want<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.350> take<00:01:26.500> your<00:01:26.650> spatula<00:01:26.890> and

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
is you want to take your spatula and

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.270 
is you want to take your spatula and
just<00:01:28.119> cut<00:01:28.390> into<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.259> bottom<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.770> then<00:01:29.979> pull

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
just cut into the bottom and then pull

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.130 
just cut into the bottom and then pull
down<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.470> bottom<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.890> pull<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
down to the bottom and pull and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.359 
down to the bottom and pull and
eventually<00:01:35.649> what<00:01:35.830> you're<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.159> see

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
eventually what you're going to see

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.960 
eventually what you're going to see
happening<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.470> liquid<00:01:38.680> egg<00:01:39.430> on<00:01:39.759> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
happening is that the liquid egg on the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
happening is that the liquid egg on the
top<00:01:40.000> here<00:01:40.479> it's<00:01:40.899> going<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.200> slowly<00:01:41.530> start

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
top here it's going to slowly start

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.969 
top here it's going to slowly start
mixing<00:01:42.790> in<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.390> merging<00:01:43.840> with<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.470> egg<00:01:44.649> on

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
mixing in and merging with the egg on

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.190 
mixing in and merging with the egg on
the<00:01:45.250> bottom<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.240> I'm<00:01:49.479> just<00:01:49.720> going<00:01:49.929> like<00:01:50.080> this

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the bottom so I'm just going like this

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
the bottom so I'm just going like this
and<00:01:50.440> pulling<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.360> making<00:01:52.690> little<00:01:52.810> slits

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and pulling and just making little slits

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.639 
and pulling and just making little slits
so<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.050> egg<00:01:56.200> becomes

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
so that all of the egg becomes

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.200 
so that all of the egg becomes
incorporated<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.729> can<00:01:57.850> actually<00:01:58.000> start

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
incorporated and you can actually start

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.800 
incorporated and you can actually start
seeing<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.800> happening<00:02:00.340> right<00:02:00.399> here<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
seeing that happening right here so you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.210 
seeing that happening right here so you
go<00:02:01.929> down<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.380> bottom<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.860> give<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.039> little

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
go down to the bottom and give a little

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
go down to the bottom and give a little
pull<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.369> want<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.640> keep<00:02:06.789> doing<00:02:06.850> this

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
pull so you just want to keep doing this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.150 
pull so you just want to keep doing this
until<00:02:08.940> most<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.119> your<00:02:10.300> egg<00:02:10.840> mixture<00:02:11.160> has

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
until most of your egg mixture has

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.150 
until most of your egg mixture has
combined<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> other<00:02:14.500> mixture

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
combined with the other mixture

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.000 
combined with the other mixture
underneath<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:17.200> know<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.410> egg<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.800> has

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
underneath you know the egg that has
