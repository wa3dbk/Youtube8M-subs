00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.940
 Good morning, they're exactly. 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.940
 4 hours and six minutes on April 12 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.699
 ten thousand and eight 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.339
 nana baby mentor 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.959
 I came here to show 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.939
 one of my bad creations 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.150
 there was already more 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.769
 is sold by him 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.439
 it's the tester 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.009
 or is to know 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.720
 with his job 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.480
 pinky would consist 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.180
 in fact then it is to know that it has the positive and negative pole like any 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.080
 the first working day component 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.350
 what happens holy effigy in the evident cadore that this pain at 10 reais 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.410
 the sporting is complete and we can do it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010
 So, your class video turn 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.470
 I'll show you what I'm doing. 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.870
 in the next class they are showing you a step by step how to vote for yourself 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.710
 the coach 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.790
 this one 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.910
 It's my tester. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.520
 is composed of a maximum usb 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.280
 with the armored cape 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 a doctor 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.280
 this little test 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 does not exist 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.780
 a car 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.460
 an eight box bar 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.150
 that is 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.860
 for those who do not know osb 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.240
 she provided energy from 5 other 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.929
 the doctor does not support this happens that the milk that the navy 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 only college and supports 2 volts 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.260
 the function of these they existed is precisely this 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.470
 to make 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.800
 5 volt voltage to 10 turns 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 I found it more interesting to note that it had a structure and isolate systems 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 on the internet 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.229
 What beauty is showing you 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.169
 this here is the 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.539
 on the 5th almost at the end of the first one I do 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.729
 this one you're going to laugh 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.119
 the athletic-go 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.589
 a CA 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.589
 with him he registers this year 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 Remembering that 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.649
 year 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:42.529
 the osb has a positive side negative side the record is always have to be on the side 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.409
 negative 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.419
 negative 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 the next step i'm intending to do 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.709
 and use 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 there is great here in question finished 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.999
 with this hood here 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.809
 would enter into the fury the tester will receive 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.519
 a lot of people do not know 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.519
 if I receive direct reverse polarity 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.359
 Can Pier Analyze System or It Field 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.769
 in mp3 drives the report has too much 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.290
 I love you in the near part the next we will see experience and a step to 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.010
 step of how to make a thinker sbt 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.549
 to the next
