back to this video saying all Jim you
said<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.519> I'll<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:05.910> two<00:04:06.150> mil<00:04:06.300> an<00:04:06.390> hour<00:04:06.510> it's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
said that I'll make two mil an hour it's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.479 
said that I'll make two mil an hour it's
very<00:04:07.530> random<00:04:08.100> now<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:09.239> could<00:04:09.450> also<00:04:09.840> make<00:04:10.709> more

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
very random now you could also make more

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.070 
very random now you could also make more
than<00:04:11.519> 2,000,000<00:04:12.120> hour<00:04:12.300> obviously<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:13.019> will

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
than 2,000,000 hour obviously there will

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.990 
than 2,000,000 hour obviously there will
be<00:04:13.230> those<00:04:13.380> times<00:04:13.650> where<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.100> don't<00:04:14.610> make<00:04:14.850> that

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
be those times where you don't make that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.409 
be those times where you don't make that
now<00:04:15.239> an<00:04:15.390> hour<00:04:15.739> but<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.760> most<00:04:17.910> part<00:04:18.060> you

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
now an hour but for the most part you

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.650 
now an hour but for the most part you
will<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.470> average<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.190> out<00:04:20.340> now<00:04:21.120> say<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.480> was

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
will if you average it out now say I was

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930 
will if you average it out now say I was
here<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:21.930> two<00:04:22.109> hours<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.250> got<00:04:23.400> nothing<00:04:23.790> but

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
here for two hours and I got nothing but

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.960 
here for two hours and I got nothing but
a<00:04:24.000> half<00:04:24.180> hour<00:04:24.390> later<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.840> got<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.860> satis<00:04:26.580> piece<00:04:26.820> or

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
a half hour later I got a satis piece or

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.900 
a half hour later I got a satis piece or
a<00:04:27.000> vest<00:04:27.270> piece<00:04:27.570> worth<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.560> 11<00:04:29.040> mil<00:04:29.220> well<00:04:29.760> then

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
a vest piece worth like 11 mil well then

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.370 
a vest piece worth like 11 mil well then
you<00:04:30.000> would<00:04:30.120> divide<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.600> by<00:04:30.780> two<00:04:30.840> hours<00:04:31.229> and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
you would divide that by two hours and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.920 
you would divide that by two hours and
30<00:04:31.530> minutes<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.039> realize<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.669> be<00:04:33.090> around

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
30 minutes and realize that be around

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.230 
30 minutes and realize that be around
just<00:04:34.410> let's<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:34.800> say<00:04:35.039> four<00:04:35.490> mil<00:04:35.699> so

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
just let's just say four mil so

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.790 
just let's just say four mil so
technically<00:04:36.630> you'd<00:04:36.780> be<00:04:36.870> making<00:04:36.990> four<00:04:37.500> million

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
technically you'd be making four million

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.100 
technically you'd be making four million
our<00:04:38.009> if<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.669> had<00:04:38.789> gotten<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.150> drop<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.660> it

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
our if you had gotten that drop and it

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.710 
our if you had gotten that drop and it
is<00:04:40.259> very<00:04:40.650> possible<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.330> don't<00:04:42.449> think

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
is very possible to do that don't think

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.460 
is very possible to do that don't think
it's<00:04:42.840> not<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:44.300> now<00:04:45.300> if<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.900> also<00:04:46.050> want<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.380> look

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
it's not so now if you also want to look

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.610 
it's not so now if you also want to look
at<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.710> from<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:46.949> point<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.310> view<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:48.199> I<00:04:49.199> got

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
at it from this point of view I I got

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.860 
at it from this point of view I I got
this<00:04:49.889> idea<00:04:50.130> for<00:04:50.639> making<00:04:50.759> this<00:04:50.970> video<00:04:51.120> from<00:04:51.419> PK

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
money-making aspect of it has been

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.610 
money-making aspect of it has been
pretty<00:05:44.010> boring<00:05:44.310> for<00:05:44.520> me<00:05:44.580> lately<00:05:44.849> so<00:05:45.470> not<00:05:46.470> the
