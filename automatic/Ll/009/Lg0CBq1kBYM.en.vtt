okay<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.760> before<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.210> begin<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.660> creating<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
okay so before we begin in creating a

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.570 
okay so before we begin in creating a
custom<00:00:10.470> draw

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
custom draw

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.339 
custom draw
we<00:00:12.240> must<00:00:12.420> first<00:00:12.630> understand

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
we must first understand

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.310 
we must first understand
file<00:00:15.070> extension<00:00:15.759> formats<00:00:16.420> that<00:00:16.570> create

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
file extension formats that create

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.939 
file extension formats that create
are<00:00:18.830> I<00:00:19.340> actually<00:00:19.910> dictate<00:00:20.539> our<00:00:20.949> drawing

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
are I actually dictate our drawing

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.760 
are I actually dictate our drawing
document<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:23.720> in<00:00:23.930> order<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.260> illustrate<00:00:24.470> that

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
document so in order to illustrate that

let's actually go and show you the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.300 
let's actually go and show you the
location<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:29.330> name<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.590> those<00:00:30.980> file

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
location and the name of those file

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.200

and<00:01:34.479> you'll<00:01:35.479> notice<00:01:35.720> here<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:37.189> a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
and you'll notice here we have this a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.120 
and you'll notice here we have this a
bunch<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.299> these<00:01:38.509> file<00:01:38.840> extensions<00:01:39.409> these<00:01:39.590> SLD

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
bunch of these file extensions these SLD

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.340 
bunch of these file extensions these SLD
DRT<00:01:40.850> files<00:01:41.380> now<00:01:42.380> these<00:01:42.560> are<00:01:42.740> your<00:01:42.860> file<00:01:43.159> format

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
DRT files now these are your file format

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.880 
DRT files now these are your file format
files<00:01:45.350> ok<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:46.820> is<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.960> file<00:01:48.229> actually<00:01:48.740> is

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
files ok this is this file actually is

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.109 
files ok this is this file actually is
what<00:01:49.250> contains<00:01:49.790> all<00:01:50.240> your<00:01:50.619> title<00:01:51.619> blocks<00:01:52.119> you

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
what contains all your title blocks you

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.350 
what contains all your title blocks you
know<00:01:53.240> your<00:01:53.479> border<00:01:53.780> lines<00:01:54.579> everything<00:01:55.579> ok

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
know your border lines everything ok

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.690 
know your border lines everything ok
this<00:01:56.930> is<00:01:57.110> not<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.500> drawing<00:01:57.829> template<00:01:58.340> so

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
this is not the drawing template so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.929 
this is not the drawing template so
that's<00:01:59.149> what<00:01:59.360> we<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.659> to<00:01:59.810> sort<00:02:00.619> of

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
that's what we have to sort of

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.270 
that's what we have to sort of
differentiate<00:02:01.939> between<00:02:02.390> those<00:02:02.719> two

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
differentiate between those two

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.880 
differentiate between those two
imagine<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.399> DRT<00:02:04.850> file<00:02:05.149> as<00:02:05.469> the<00:02:06.469> file<00:02:06.680> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
imagine the DRT file as the file that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.749 
imagine the DRT file as the file that
contains<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.579> lines<00:02:07.959> ok<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> template

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
contains all the lines ok the template

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.600 
contains all the lines ok the template
now<00:02:11.329> the<00:02:11.390> templates<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:11.959> what<00:02:12.290> hold<00:02:12.650> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
now the templates are what hold the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.630 
now the templates are what hold the
crucial<00:02:14.510> data<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:15.320> far<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.709> what<00:02:15.920> units<00:02:16.400> you're

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
crucial data as far as what units you're

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.390 
crucial data as far as what units you're
using<00:02:16.850> your<00:02:17.750> dimension<00:02:18.410> font<00:02:18.650> sizes<00:02:18.920> your

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
using your dimension font sizes your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.940 
using your dimension font sizes your

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
note font sizes how dimensions are

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.880 
note font sizes how dimensions are
displayed<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.470> design

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
displayed all of that so the design

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.080 
displayed all of that so the design
templates<00:02:25.310> hold<00:02:26.199> no<00:02:27.199> lines<00:02:27.530> no<00:02:27.949> title<00:02:28.880> blocks

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090

so imagine the drawing templates as sort

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.790 
so imagine the drawing templates as sort
of<00:02:37.570> what<00:02:38.570> drives<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.590> format<00:02:40.510> okay<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.350> if<00:02:42.680> I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
of what drives the format okay so if I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
of what drives the format okay so if I
was<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.010> go<00:02:43.130> ahead<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.370> double<00:02:43.460> click<00:02:43.580> in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
was to go ahead and double click in

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.600 
was to go ahead and double click in
templates<00:02:44.530> you'll<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.740> here<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.250> have

templates you'll see here that I have
these<00:02:47.500> default<00:02:48.500> templates<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.040> SolidWorks

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
these default templates that SolidWorks

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.030 
these default templates that SolidWorks

cover this very briefly when we start
creating<00:03:22.430> our<00:03:22.790> custom<00:03:23.420> sheet<00:03:24.140> formats<00:03:24.620> this

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
creating our custom sheet formats this

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.260 
creating our custom sheet formats this
will<00:03:25.040> actually<00:03:25.190> come<00:03:25.430> into<00:03:25.580> play<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.120> you'll

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
will actually come into play and you'll

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
this is actually what shows up when you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.740 
this is actually what shows up when you
create<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.580> new<00:03:36.730> drawing<00:03:37.730> document<00:03:38.270> okay<00:03:40.750> now

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
create a new drawing document okay now

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.230 
create a new drawing document okay now
this<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.440> when<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:42.950> shape<00:03:43.130> when<00:03:43.490> you<00:03:43.580> save<00:03:43.940> a

sort of got that you know under our
belts<00:03:56.390> let's<00:03:56.630> say<00:03:56.830> let's<00:03:57.830> go<00:03:57.980> ahead<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.250> show

sense in the next video when we actually

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.550 
sense in the next video when we actually
go<00:04:03.350> ahead<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.890> create<00:04:04.130> our<00:04:05.050> custom<00:04:06.050> drawing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
go ahead and create our custom drawing
