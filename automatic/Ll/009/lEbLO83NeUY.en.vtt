00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
junkyards that's that's the problem I'm

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.070 
junkyards that's that's the problem I'm
standing<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:01.399> front<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.700> fiat<00:02:02.000> strada<00:02:02.479> this

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
standing in front of a fiat strada this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.600 
standing in front of a fiat strada this
is<00:02:03.259> really<00:02:03.530> basically<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:03.979> car<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.340> killed

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
is really basically the car that killed

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.120 
is really basically the car that killed
Fiat<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.209> first<00:02:05.390> time<00:02:05.600> around<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.560> u.s.<00:02:06.860> I

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
Fiat the first time around in the u.s. I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.710 
Fiat the first time around in the u.s. I
haven't<00:02:07.700> seen<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.030> these<00:02:08.149> things<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.479> 30

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
haven't seen one of these things in 30

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.270 
haven't seen one of these things in 30
years<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.229> think<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.590> may<00:02:09.769> be<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:10.039> last

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
years and I think this may be the last

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640 
years and I think this may be the last
one<00:02:10.670> since<00:02:11.360> there<00:02:11.540> isn't<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.780> breeding<00:02:12.049> pair<00:02:12.410> a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
one since there isn't a breeding pair a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.680 
one since there isn't a breeding pair a
fiat<00:02:13.160> strada<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:13.880> when<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.480> car

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
fiat strada is here when this car

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.479 
fiat strada is here when this car
expires<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.680> they're<00:02:16.010> extinct<00:02:16.400> every

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
expires that's it they're extinct every

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.059 
expires that's it they're extinct every
third<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:21.080> nice<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.799> something

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
third on it's nice to have something

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.220 
third on it's nice to have something
unique<00:02:22.549> but<00:02:22.880> at<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.150> same<00:02:23.360> time<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.170> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
unique but at the same time it's it's a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.820 
unique but at the same time it's it's a
little<00:02:24.319> bit<00:02:24.470> sad<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:25.099> car<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.840> car<00:02:27.230> was

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
little bit sad for the car the car was

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.289 
little bit sad for the car the car was
misunderstood<00:02:28.549> I<00:02:28.610> think<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> United

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
misunderstood I think in the United

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.720 
misunderstood I think in the United
States<00:02:29.720> maybe<00:02:29.930> even<00:02:30.170> globally<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:31.190> doesn't

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730

of the golf doesn't have the doors fall

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.610
