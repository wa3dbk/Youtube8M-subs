00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.090
 the architects greet you really 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:10.300
 Vázquez from the Dominican Republic in 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.059
 this time I have here a small 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.689
 scene with which he intends to show you 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.870
 how to make grass for our scenes 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.330
 using the hair or hair tool 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.980
 I already have my scene created a scene 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 of simple example 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.220
 a camera created 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.140
 what is the part of the scene that I'm going to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.050
 render how they can see the scene 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.070
 from the camera you can not see completely 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.440
 then I'm going to leave here to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.020
 show him something here I have all the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.520
 land and it's on the ground where I'm going to 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.650
 apply the lawn but as it is not going to 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.320
 see everything I have only duplicated that 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.900
 ground that is being this object that 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.090
 we have here and I have deleted the polygons 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.980
 that are out of sight of the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.430
 camera then we have this little 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.350
 is the portion that is attained if 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.509
 see here 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.150
 then to that what we are going to apply 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.750
 the grass so that it consumes less 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.120
 resources of our team 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.610
 nothing with this I am selected 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.300
 let's go here the simulation air objects 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.060
 add hair 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.710
 immediately they do not create the guides 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.619
 we select that object 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.390
 here in guides I'm going to lower the length 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:32.130
 to 3 centimeters and in a segment at 4 meters 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.979
 I will come here bareback 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.079
 I'm going to lower the segments to 4 as well and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.210
 this amount from here the amount of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.070
 hair that will generate us I'm going to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.829
 increase but for now I'm going to leave 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.289
 so in what I believe the other parameters 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.570
 and then before rendering, let's go to 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.490
 increase this value I'm going here to generate 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 I'll tell you flat so I can see the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.659
 geometry in my scene here we have been 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.659
 created a texture 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 let's change some values ​​here 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.190
 here in the thickness I'm going to put 02 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.880
 centimeters 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.880
 two centimeters 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.190
 a variation 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 maybe 40 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.080
 that difference and I'm going to activate 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.680
 only stir that as you see here already 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.240
 you can see the grass I'm going to throw 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.770
 here this material that I created that 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.710
 it's just a color with a little 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.740
 speculate and that 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.270
 I'm going to throw it here bareback so 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.850
 be that color control it better 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.070
 we already have what we want there but 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.290
 we see that there are many gaps 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.310
 we come back here to the hair tool 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.410
 in hairs and we increase the value I go to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.170
 put a pretty good value so that it does not 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.160
 there are many blank spaces 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.590
 I'm going to put 200 mm 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.490
 this makes the render look good 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.220
 heavy well slow slow well but we 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.960
 give very good results in terms of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.760
 geometry that is generated here 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.370
 as you can see it has been filled almost by 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.740
 complete the area that interests us 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.740
 then I'm going to throw the render now 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.430
 how well slow is the slow 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.370
 process so I'm going to pause the video and we 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.640
 we see in a moment 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 very good friends as you can see already 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.780
 our render is finishing the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.269
 result is pretty decent could 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.380
 maybe improve some things a little more 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.270
 but this one is pretty good 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.510
 and there we only have to play 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.610
 with the parameters that we want 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.560
 so that the hair is a little bit more 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.800
 wavy or longer as you 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.100
 prefer 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.950
 all right 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.430
 and here you can see it finished 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.000
 is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.400
 it is something that is quite simple 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.180
 only yes that having so much 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.669
 of hair geometry as it takes 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.949
 quite the render in this case took 13 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.830
 minutes with three seconds then nothing 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:33.710
 friends, I hope you liked it 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.710
 and every month vázquez farewell greetings
