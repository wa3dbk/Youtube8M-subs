coat<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
coat of this but you can do too if you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
coat of this but you can do too if you
want<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> dab<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.340 
want but we're just going to dab a
little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.399> white<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> top<00:01:54.360> with

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
little bit more white at the top with

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.639 
little bit more white at the top with
our<00:01:55.649> cosmetic<00:01:56.549> wedge<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
our cosmetic wedge I'm not going to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.440 
our cosmetic wedge I'm not going to
paint<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.369> colors<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
paint all the colors on you can do it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
paint all the colors on you can do it
that<00:02:00.659> way<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.130> i<00:02:02.189> think<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that way if you want but i think it is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.030 
that way if you want but i think it is
much<00:02:02.880> easier<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.229> polish<00:02:04.829> on

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
much easier to just put one polish on

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.010 
much easier to just put one polish on
and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.460> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.820> DAB<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.299> where<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and then just kind of DAB it where you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.589 
and then just kind of DAB it where you
want<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.759> candy<00:02:09.060> corn<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.450> you
