 how can we see 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.489
 the transition from one screen to another is really very fast 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.370

 the birthdays widget I was talking about earlier 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.570
 and it is for a very comfortable widget that will allow us to always have below 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.580
 control the birthdays of our friends on this screen instead we have in the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.870
 we can use the button at the bottom right 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.919
 we press on this 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.099

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.470
 quick very fast 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.470
 from the very reactive mind 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.960
 we can go to the panel management screen also in this way 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.960
 we can add all the screens we would like 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.650
 we could arrive at a practically finished number now precisely not 

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.080
 I know what the limit is, but you have seen how easy it is to customize 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.689
 this very interesting interface also the possibility to choose the 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:50.490

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.750
 very beautiful. esbit boldone developed is really very responsive at least on 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.630
