00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.480
 like every year, the circus 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 zavatta draws up his capital square 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.830
 Wear small as big are 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.969
 invited to discover numbers 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.920
 amazing and this year again 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.719
 many things in the program of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.560
 juggling the American roll of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.690
 Chinese plates 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.699
 not to mention the long-awaited number 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.840
 that of the balancing climber climbing to 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.939
 seven meters high 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 Stephanie Beautour is in charge of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.359
 the administrative and we find it at 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.019
 the front of the marquee to accommodate 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.000
 spectators 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 she is also on the track with her 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 two companions sultan and qashqai 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.860
 it's a modern marquee 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 wants to introduce new visuals 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 that's why we do not have 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.370
 a lot of animals we do more 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.039
 part participate adults at the level 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 aerial evolutions is also 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.350
 circus schools so that's the fact 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 to have fewer animals gives more room 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.140
 we will tell new talent to 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.149
 new visuals more cabaret we will say 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.329
 to know a little bit in the in 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.769
 the visual term show other than the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.630
 traditional circus 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.640
 the avataq troupe have a lot of talent 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 better by the young josh of the family 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 Italian adami acrobats but not 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.409
 only 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 whether it 's balls hoops or 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 club for him that's for sure 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.650
 juggling has no secrets and then we 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 switch to higher format with duo 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.369
 cremona serrus juggles but this time 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.009
 with cubes and circles 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.530
 gigantic result a nice effect 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.479
 optics for the public and finally more 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 musical we find the duo 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 comic ballerinas it's a little lake 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 swans revisited with a lot 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 of humor between tradition and modernity 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 stuffing number manages to touch the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 young audience as the oldest is 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.960
 so that's the end goal at the circus 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.470
 everyone finds his account and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.470
 make laugh 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.940
 prince khalifa sir weather 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.590
 I liked that she had the clowns 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.120
 who was doing boxing and when there was 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.510
 the other clown who was not stopping 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.310
 bring back the balloons and st at the end when 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.280
 of Germans were filled with water and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.649
 well liked yes what would be the circus 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.180
 without these clowns because under the canvas this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.400
 are laughing animals and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.320
 thrills that we find the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.330
 circus does its number it works 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.400
 well and this for the greatest pleasure 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.910
 spectators 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 we try to discover rediscover 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.160
 young people to young children 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.620
 the passion of the circus here despite the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.750
 difficulties that we encounter more 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.600
 in addition in this medium level 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 administration at the level of the town halls and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.940
 for that we can not anymore 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.070
 propose certain species in captivity 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.870
 indeed this is becoming more and more 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.360
 difficult to obtain permissions 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 administrative requests for the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.230
 circus with animals are getting more 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.150
 many and sometimes the troop can only 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.730
 no longer obtain a certificate of ability 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.500
 for some species from countries like the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.300
 belgium austria or holland have 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.070
 forbids wild animals in the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.110
 circuses and yet in France the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.420
 circus tradition is still strong 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 it's also somewhere 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.170
 a tradition of continuing what we have 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.880
 transmitted is what we will transmit to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.470
 our children what our great 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.360
 parents and our great grandparents 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 have passed on to us passion and love 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.870
 of our craft and the love of our 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.310
 mixed with animals that's why 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810
 that there is so much public who wants to come 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.310
 at the circus is to see this 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.290
 complicity we have with our animals 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.850
 because only we to the force of 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.450
 things to the force of living with 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.610
 we can get from them such and such 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.739
 friendship the circus to its traditions of 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.489
 popcorn from the cotton candy of animals 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.849
 clowns 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.280
 here is the light there the magic of the circus 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.019
 stays under a canvas and in a track 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.599
 round round what to do 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.989
 move the animals otherwise it's a 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.840
 scene 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.720
 it's not a fun track 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.790
 marveled create the illusion the magic of 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.590
 circus this is because there where there 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.090
 will have children and big kids 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.090
 there will always be circus
