00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
played a lot of hardcore just for the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.160 
played a lot of hardcore just for the
fact<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.110> hit<00:01:13.350> kill<00:01:13.790> obviously

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
fact that it's a one hit kill obviously

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.450 
fact that it's a one hit kill obviously
you're<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> die<00:01:16.530> quicker<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.130> into<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you're going to die quicker get into it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.140 
you're going to die quicker get into it
but<00:01:18.830> you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.250> probably<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.880> lot

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but you're going to get probably a lot

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.969 
but you're going to get probably a lot
the<00:01:21.659> percentage<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> amount<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.799> kills

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the percentage of the amount of kills

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
the percentage of the amount of kills
you'd<00:01:23.220> get<00:01:23.430> compared<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> play<00:01:24.150> another<00:01:24.600> game

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you'd get compared to play another game

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
you'd get compared to play another game
and<00:01:25.170> you'd<00:01:25.740> probably<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.190> lot<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.430> kills

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and you'd probably get a lot more kills

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
same stuff all the time it does get a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.949 
same stuff all the time it does get a
bit<00:02:16.530> Repair<00:02:17.010> Van<00:02:17.040> boring<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.209> try<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.780> mix

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
bit Repair Van boring so I try and mix

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.570 
bit Repair Van boring so I try and mix
it<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.170> as<00:02:19.349> best<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:23.010> sure<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
it up as best I can and I'm sure the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610 
it up as best I can and I'm sure the
challenges<00:02:24.330> were<00:02:24.480> pretty<00:02:24.780> hard<00:02:25.110> them<00:02:25.379> i<00:02:25.590> think

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
challenges were pretty hard them i think

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.400 
challenges were pretty hard them i think
you<00:02:25.950> gotta<00:02:26.129> get<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.569> 25<00:02:27.569> hatchet<00:02:28.140> kills

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
you gotta get like 25 hatchet kills

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.650 
you gotta get like 25 hatchet kills
while<00:02:28.769> carrying<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> assault<00:02:29.700> shield<00:02:29.940> too<00:02:30.180> so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
while carrying the assault shield too so

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.589 
while carrying the assault shield too so
that's<00:02:30.900> basically<00:02:31.459> 25<00:02:32.459> tomahawk<00:02:32.970> kills<00:02:33.300> of

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
that's basically 25 tomahawk kills of

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.540

the assault shield you're probably going

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.690 
the assault shield you're probably going
to<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.319> want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> go<00:03:16.650> lightweight<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.310> extreme

conditioning<00:03:18.209> that's<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.600> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> make

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
conditioning that's just going to make

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.440 
conditioning that's just going to make
it<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.109> lot<00:03:19.260> better<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.209> scavenger<00:03:21.209> and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
it a lot better for you scavenger and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.250 
it a lot better for you scavenger and
farce<00:03:22.410> hands<00:03:22.850> 44<00:03:23.850> /<00:03:24.030> 2<00:03:24.299> with<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> perk<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.959> greed

wildcard<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:26.239> scavengers<00:03:27.239> too<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.569> can

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
wildcard and scavengers too so you can

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.430 
wildcard and scavengers too so you can
replenish<00:03:29.090> mc4<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.660> shock<00:03:30.989> charges

replenish mc4 and the shock charges
that's<00:03:31.620> what<00:03:31.769> i<00:03:31.799> am<00:03:31.920> using<00:03:32.269> shock<00:03:33.269> challenges

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that's what i am using shock challenges

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.090 
that's what i am using shock challenges
are<00:03:33.780> good<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.049> assault<00:03:34.350> shield<00:03:34.530> as<00:03:34.680> well<00:03:34.859> and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
are good for assault shield as well and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
are good for assault shield as well and
slow<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.970> enemy<00:03:36.209> down<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.389> lot<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.230> add

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
slow the enemy down a lot so you can add

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.870 
slow the enemy down a lot so you can add
this<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.010> bits<00:03:38.250> quite<00:03:38.430> funny<00:03:38.670> here

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
this but this bits quite funny here
