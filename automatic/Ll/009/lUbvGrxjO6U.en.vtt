00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
coach our linebackers the way that that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
coach our linebackers the way that that
some<00:00:24.600> other<00:00:24.750> school<00:00:25.080> has<00:00:25.289> has<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.220> ability

some other school has has that ability

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.269 
some other school has has that ability
so<00:00:27.050> it'll<00:00:28.050> take<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.529> bit<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.920> we're

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so it'll take a little bit of time we're

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.650 
so it'll take a little bit of time we're
not<00:00:29.400> trying<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.880> fast<00:00:30.119> we're<00:00:30.390> trying<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
not trying to do it fast we're trying to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
not trying to do it fast we're trying to
do<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.550> said<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
do it then and when it's all said and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.250 
do it then and when it's all said and
done<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.180> it'll<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> product<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
done I think it'll be a product that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
done I think it'll be a product that
nobody<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> match<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.270> far<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
nobody can match now as far as the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
nobody can match now as far as the
offense<00:00:37.230> offensive<00:00:38.190> side<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> ball

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
offense offensive side of the ball

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
offense offensive side of the ball

similar to what we have when we're at

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
similar to what we have when we're at
USC<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.370> years<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.960> with<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.110> the
