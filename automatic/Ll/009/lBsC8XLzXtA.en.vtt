00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pretty useful for a few things we rather

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.320 
pretty useful for a few things we rather
than<00:01:34.260> just<00:01:34.470> light<00:01:34.740> I'll<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:35.610> later<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
than just light I'll see that later on

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.200 
than just light I'll see that later on
but<00:01:37.310> basically<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> next<00:01:38.580> thing<00:01:38.790> probably

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
but basically the next thing probably

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.730 
but basically the next thing probably
you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> set<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> tent<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.560> going

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you want to set up a tent now I'm going

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
you want to set up a tent now I'm going
to<00:01:40.830> show<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.159> why<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.850> tents<00:01:42.330> are<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to show you know why these tents are a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
to show you know why these tents are a
bit<00:01:42.570> tricky<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.080> right<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.619> our<00:01:43.770> distance

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bit tricky so right here our distance

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.450 
bit tricky so right here our distance
away<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.790> I'm<00:01:45.150> gonna<00:01:45.330> drop<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:46.070> Imperial<00:01:47.070> tent

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
away and I'm gonna drop my Imperial tent

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.890 
away and I'm gonna drop my Imperial tent
Imperial<00:01:48.060> tents<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.390> better<00:01:48.600> than<00:01:48.780> normal

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
Imperial tents are better than normal

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.990 
Imperial tents are better than normal
tents<00:01:49.380> normal<00:01:50.009> tents<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.430> smaller<00:01:50.700> I'd

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
tents normal tents are just smaller I'd

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
tents normal tents are just smaller I'd
go<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.080> your<00:01:52.200> own<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.560> camping

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
go with this if your own for camping

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.820 
go with this if your own for camping
it's<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.580> bit<00:01:53.700> more<00:01:53.850> spendy<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.450> hey<00:01:54.830> what

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
it's also a bit more spendy but hey what

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.219 
it's also a bit more spendy but hey what
else<00:01:56.009> yeah<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.030> also<00:01:57.180> craft<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.960> stuff

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
else yeah you can also craft this stuff

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
else yeah you can also craft this stuff
which<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.650> scene<00:01:58.920> later<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.430> tents

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
which will be a scene later but tents

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.969 
which will be a scene later but tents
take<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> longer<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.110> put<00:02:01.380> down<00:02:01.560> than<00:02:01.770> most

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
take of longer to put down than most

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
take of longer to put down than most
things<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.060> away<00:02:03.270> from

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
things but here it was I was away from

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
things but here it was I was away from
it<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.409> by<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> fire<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.640> if

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it and it's right by the fire now so if

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
it and it's right by the fire now so if
you<00:02:05.939> ever<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> symbol<00:02:06.810> something<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you ever want to symbol something you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.580 
you ever want to symbol something you
crouch<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.159> use<00:02:08.549> it<00:02:08.929> fires<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.259> not<00:02:10.380> work

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
crouch and use it fires will not work

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
crouch and use it fires will not work
like<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.580> relight<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
like this because you can just relight a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.080 
like this because you can just relight a
fire<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.569> another

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
fire with another

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
fire with another
the<00:02:13.150> box<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.690> takes<00:02:14.050> up<00:02:14.230> some<00:02:14.440> firewood

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
the box it just takes up some firewood

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.979 
the box it just takes up some firewood
so<00:02:15.670> basically<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.209> got<00:02:16.450> your<00:02:16.540> tent<00:02:16.780> set

so basically now you got your tent set
up<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.319> kind<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.769> basic

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
up and that's kind of the basic

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.160 
up and that's kind of the basic
necessities<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:19.000> you're<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.569> be<00:02:19.780> camping
