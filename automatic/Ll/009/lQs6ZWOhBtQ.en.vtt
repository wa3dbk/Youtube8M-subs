00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 with girls possibility of today finally 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 I bring you the video that I had already 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.790
 said of all my purple lipsticks 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 missing one that I do not find that is the mix 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.620
 jellyfish is also intense purple and I 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.000
 I love it but I do not know where it is but good 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.140
 anyway I wanted to mention if any 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.869
 of you have it or see it but pre 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.930
 but well let's start the first 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.100
 I have here is the purple baby lips 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.100
 what is it like 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.560
 father because it's not like the typical rose 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.360
 then you put it on and it leaves you a tone 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.880
 as pretty in fact it's from the other post 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.300
 then I have this mix called 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 thalÃ­a 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.280
 that in itself really is not a purple tone 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.559
 but since you compare but since it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.739
 you compare with a rose yes it looks pretty 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.980
 like the lilac tone he has and I like 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.260
 a lot because it's like it's not has not 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 nothing of glitters nothing is completely 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.600
 creamy I paco and I quite like this 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.740
 it's mix after you already know about my 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.020
 favorites this is in fact 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.350
 in the bumps of sensation colors 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 this is the manual mode 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.600
 and this also to the naked eye is not seen 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.840
 as purple 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.759
 it's like between pink and purple in 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.369
 Same lips looks like a lilac outline 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.530
 more pink but the same is super usable 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.940
 you're wearing it even if you do not bring 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.680
 no makeup and you just put on 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.869
 toledo very beautiful color on the lips 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.570
 has like this brillito does not have 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.640
 glitter but more like gloss and that has 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.840
 finished on the lipstick that does not stick 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.330
 hair or anything but if it looks like 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.119
 bright then I have this what 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 they saw in my recent hall is the ones 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.140
 bits of maybelline s 90 five breaks 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.020
 john barry 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.200
 and there's like intense lilac neon looks 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.520
 very nice 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.300
 I love 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.830
 apart from the packaging is super father 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.380
 but they have also heard me talk 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.100
 much is the maybelline lead of the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:10.860
 line of yesterday stream or hydro stream 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.630
 808 06 and this also in fact I already have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.920
 super little I bought two of this me 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.840
 love 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.030
 this is like this perfect tone as 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.770
 for a touch of color that you bring a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.090
 tuxedo and you wear one of these is 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.730
 perfect 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.920
 and also smell super rich they last you 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.900
 I quite have this that is also a 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 recent acquisition is the same those of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.910
 The revlon color bears 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.590
 matt barnes is completely mate and this 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.569
 It is also a bit inside the most 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.819
 dark 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.469
 I love the effect as menthol 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.120
 it has a mint smell and also how do you 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:47.290
 you put that effect like cool me 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.329
 I like it a lot and it lasts a long time and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.440
 it is taking away as gradually or 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:56.040
 it does not go like that the hole 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.230
 what you lack of lipstick but as 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.540
 goes down, lowering the point that is not 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.770
 see badly and you already replicate it and no longer 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.850
 you see as well as see I do not know if I explain 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.830
 many times what happens to me that we put you 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.420
 a red lipstick and it is removed as only 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.120
 of this part of his horrible so with the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.040
 red shore and medium brown with 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
 This does not happen, I like it a lot because 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.340
 It leaves you like an ink on your lips 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.130
 this is the cherry of shy are from the line 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.470
 extra time the color is supposed to be 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.260
 beautiful you have to put several layers 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.390
 so that it looks that dark and also 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.940
 it can be a bit like 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.980
 as patches or as you put it on 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.830
 and you do it again and remove some 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.560
 part I do not know but the color is 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.090
 incredible they do not last you long or they are not 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.920
 well that is, they are supposed to be long 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.920
 duration are not long duration they are a 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.820
 normal duration but I like also not 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.650
 they smell rich 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.990
 until I was everything wrong with the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
 life I do not like the color so much 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.160
 I put it because this is how I use it 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.840
 because I like the color produced in 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.819
 focus on your pocket starter of headdress 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 the last thing I have this only what 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.680
 I put for you girls that you like 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.390
 The gloss is because they know that I do not 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.400
 they like but it is very good for me 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.010
 This is called inba vision of yolette 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.950
 0-40 of e mailing color elixir with the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.600
 dixit's instructions 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.640
 or something like that is the most purple thing in the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.760
 world is literal like a lipstick 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.620
 liquid 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.300
 The tone is very similar to the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.190
 chrome 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.930
 and he's super father so if they're 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.849
 looking for what I know if you like the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.770
 gloss is these are super pigmented 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.180
 super super fragmented these are the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.280
 purple lipsticks so far 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.930

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.440
