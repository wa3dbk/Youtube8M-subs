nutritional<00:01:55.229> value<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.590> probably<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.100> real

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
nutritional value is probably not real

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
nutritional value is probably not real
high<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.329> they're<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:57.750> they're<00:01:58.020> tasty

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
high but but they're good they're tasty

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100 
high but but they're good they're tasty
and<00:01:59.180> as<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.390> see<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:00.780> sorts<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and as you can see all sorts of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.480 
and as you can see all sorts of
wonderful<00:02:01.380> things<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> things

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
wonderful things in them and the things

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
wonderful things in them and the things
with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> reconstituted<00:02:03.479> vegetables<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
with the reconstituted vegetables and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.280 
with the reconstituted vegetables and
things<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.740> dried<00:02:04.950> vegetables<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:06.600> tasty

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
things the dried vegetables really tasty

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.839 
things the dried vegetables really tasty
it's<00:02:07.740> quite<00:02:08.220> surprising

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
it's quite surprising

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.449 
it's quite surprising
so<00:02:10.849> that's<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> variety<00:02:11.599> just<00:02:11.629> in<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.019> small

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
so that's the variety just in a small

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.170 
so that's the variety just in a small
average-sized<00:02:14.230> drugstore<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:17.000> you'd

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
average-sized drugstore so you'd

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240 
average-sized drugstore so you'd
probably<00:02:17.390> see<00:02:17.690> our<00:02:17.840> five<00:02:18.230> times<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.890> variety

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
probably see our five times that variety

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.009 
probably see our five times that variety
in<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.700> big<00:02:19.879> supermarket<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.750> went<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.989> a

in a big supermarket if you went to a

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.680

just do it quickly open it up take out
the<00:02:44.780> package<00:02:45.170> bits<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.459> one's<00:02:46.730> got<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the package bits this one's got a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.880 
the package bits this one's got a
package<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.640> sauce<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.180> package<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.890> sort

but parsley bits and then pouring the
hot<00:02:59.480> water<00:03:01.150> close<00:03:02.150> down<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.540> top<00:03:03.220> for<00:03:04.220> three

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
hot water close down the top for three

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.559 
hot water close down the top for three
minutes

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.240 

and<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.349> one's<00:03:09.620> got<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.069> little

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and then this one's got this little

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.479 
and then this one's got this little
system<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:10.939> so<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.299> just<00:03:11.360> pop<00:03:11.750> off<00:03:11.900> this

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
system here so you just pop off this

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.289 
system here so you just pop off this
little<00:03:13.489> trapdoor<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.579> got<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.939> clever

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
little trapdoor and it's got this clever

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.470 
little trapdoor and it's got this clever
little<00:03:20.950> sieve<00:03:21.950> system<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:22.909> that<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.269> pour

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
little sieve system so that you can pour

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.729 
little sieve system so that you can pour
the<00:03:23.510> water<00:03:23.599> out<00:03:23.890> it's<00:03:24.890> clever<00:03:25.189> isn't<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:26.739> watch

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
the water out it's clever isn't it watch

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.660 
the water out it's clever isn't it watch
out<00:03:27.920> for<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.189> steam

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 

and<00:03:35.970> then<00:03:36.300> pouring<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> sauce<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and then pouring the sauce and the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
and then pouring the sauce and the
parsley<00:03:37.950> they're<00:03:38.340> different<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.760> course

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
parsley they're different of course

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.340 
parsley they're different of course
there's<00:03:39.240> all<00:03:39.360> sorts<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.660> different<00:03:39.990> ones<00:03:40.050> this

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
there's all sorts of different ones this

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.840 
there's all sorts of different ones this
is<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:41.010> basic<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:41.580> it's<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
is a really basic one it's just

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.460 
is a really basic one it's just
basically<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.390> noodles<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.350> had

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
basically the noodles and then you had

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
basically the noodles and then you had
the<00:03:43.590> sauce<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.130> parsley<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:44.880> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
the sauce and the parsley so it's a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.970 
the sauce and the parsley so it's a
really<00:03:45.330> really<00:03:45.450> simple<00:03:45.750> one<00:03:46.110> some<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.890> them

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
really really simple one some of them

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190 
really really simple one some of them
got<00:03:47.130> amazing<00:03:47.400> stuff<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.030> them<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:49.110> other

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200

thing do with these things too is you
can<00:03:50.730> use<00:03:51.150> them<00:03:51.360> as<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:52.020> base<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.860> then<00:03:53.130> put

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370
