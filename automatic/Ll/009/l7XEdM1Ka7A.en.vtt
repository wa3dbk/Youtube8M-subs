hey guys xperia x8 old and today we will

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.539 
hey guys xperia x8 old and today we will
be<00:00:08.280> making<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:12.000> diamond<00:00:12.629> generator<00:00:13.169> of<00:00:13.589> bhangra

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
be making a diamond generator of bhangra

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790 
be making a diamond generator of bhangra
and<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.809> let<00:00:15.959> you<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.140> this<00:00:16.320> only<00:00:16.470> worked

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and just let you know this only worked

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.850 
and just let you know this only worked
on<00:00:17.100> tacky<00:00:17.610> or<00:00:17.940> technical<00:00:18.810> whatever<00:00:19.620> you<00:00:19.710> want

on tacky or technical whatever you want
to<00:00:19.920> call<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.190> so<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.630> want<00:00:21.780> to<00:00:21.870> start<00:00:21.900> off<00:00:22.410> by

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to call it so you want to start off by

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
to call it so you want to start off by
doing<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.100> three<00:00:23.670> by<00:00:24.540> five<00:00:24.710> grid<00:00:26.990> what's<00:00:27.990> up

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
doing a three by five grid what's up

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
doing a three by five grid what's up
like<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:29.510> 355<00:00:31.250> 53<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.429> five<00:00:32.910> grid<00:00:33.449> of<00:00:34.850> solar

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
like a 355 53 like five grid of solar

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
like a 355 53 like five grid of solar
panels<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:38.600> these<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.719> high<00:00:39.960> voltage<00:00:40.499> solar

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
panels and these are high voltage solar

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.290 
panels and these are high voltage solar
panels<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.160> don't<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.789> use<00:00:41.999> these

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
panels you don't have to use these

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.989 
panels you don't have to use these
because<00:00:42.480> obviously<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.399> survival<00:00:44.399> mode<00:00:44.429> these

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
because obviously in survival mode these

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.029 
because obviously in survival mode these
are<00:00:45.300> rather<00:00:46.109> expensive<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.769> use<00:00:49.769> up

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
are rather expensive to make and use up

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.899 
are rather expensive to make and use up
a<00:00:50.989> lot<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.319> resources<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.370> obviously<00:00:53.730> i'm

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
a lot of resources but obviously i'm

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.880

isn't needed you can you have a chest
you<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:02.120> but<00:02:03.120> I<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.300> think<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.570> holds<00:02:03.720> more

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you want but I just think it holds more

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.860 
you want but I just think it holds more
so<00:02:04.380> though<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.980> think<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.430> best<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:06.510> start

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
so though I think it's the best do start

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.559 
so though I think it's the best do start
and<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.320> drag<00:02:07.620> your<00:02:07.650> cable<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.450> way

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and you just drag your cable all the way

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.050 
and you just drag your cable all the way
around

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
around

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
around

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
your soil finals and it should link into

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.880 
your soil finals and it should link into
pretty<00:02:14.190> much<00:02:14.280> each<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.730> every<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:16.130> and

pretty much each and every one and

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000 
pretty much each and every one and
they're<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:21.140> okay<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.800> want<00:02:22.950> to

flat<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.800> because<00:06:00.550> it's<00:06:01.150> so<00:06:01.390> much<00:06:01.510> easier<00:06:01.630> just

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
flat is because it's so much easier just

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.650 
flat is because it's so much easier just
to<00:06:02.500> build<00:06:03.040> on<00:06:03.280> and<00:06:03.700> you<00:06:03.820> got<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.120> find<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.450> flat

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
to build on and you got to find a flat

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.000 
to build on and you got to find a flat
space<00:06:05.430> not<00:06:06.430> like<00:06:06.580> I'm<00:06:06.730> an<00:06:06.850> uber<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.330> then<00:06:08.010> play

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
space not like I'm an uber and then play

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.120

on this video yeah i'll be doing a video
on<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.640> quarry<00:06:16.360> at<00:06:16.840> the<00:06:16.990> clinic<00:06:17.230> as<00:06:17.350> well

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
on a quarry at the clinic as well

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.650 
on a quarry at the clinic as well
they're<00:06:17.830> they're<00:06:18.190> quite<00:06:18.400> simple<00:06:18.880> well

they're they're quite simple well

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.650 
they're they're quite simple well
obviously<00:06:19.960> they're<00:06:20.410> very<00:06:21.400> effective<00:06:22.060> but

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
obviously they're very effective but

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.040 
obviously they're very effective but
don't<00:06:22.900> work<00:06:23.050> very<00:06:23.080> well<00:06:23.320> and<00:06:23.530> super<00:06:23.980> flat
