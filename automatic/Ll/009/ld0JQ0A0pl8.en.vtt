00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:02.709 
hi I'm Carrie with north beach worm

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.740 
hi I'm Carrie with north beach worm
ranch<00:00:03.009> and<00:00:03.370> I'm<00:00:03.699> here<00:00:03.939> today<00:00:04.090> to<00:00:04.300> show<00:00:04.600> you<00:00:04.630> how

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
ranch and I'm here today to show you how

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.570 
ranch and I'm here today to show you how
to<00:00:04.870> make<00:00:05.050> a<00:00:05.080> worm<00:00:05.380> Tower<00:00:05.740> it's<00:00:06.100> really<00:00:06.370> easy

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
to make a worm Tower it's really easy

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.959 
to make a worm Tower it's really easy
you<00:00:07.510> get<00:00:07.660> a<00:00:07.690> piece<00:00:07.900> of<00:00:08.050> PVC<00:00:08.259> pipe<00:00:08.860> and<00:00:09.280> we<00:00:09.759> just

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
you get a piece of PVC pipe and we just

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.659 
you get a piece of PVC pipe and we just
found<00:00:10.179> this<00:00:10.419> one<00:00:10.799> you<00:00:11.799> can<00:00:12.009> get<00:00:12.280> it<00:00:12.400> from<00:00:12.610> a

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669 
found this one you can get it from a

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.159 
found this one you can get it from a
hardware<00:00:13.089> store<00:00:13.240> or<00:00:13.839> a<00:00:13.869> lot<00:00:14.019> of<00:00:14.049> different

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.169 
hardware store or a lot of different

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.679 
hardware store or a lot of different
places<00:00:14.589> it's<00:00:15.249> about<00:00:15.459> the<00:00:15.669> size<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.150> my<00:00:16.240> hand<00:00:16.449> in

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
places it's about the size of my hand in

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.890 
places it's about the size of my hand in
diameter<00:00:16.929> you<00:00:17.140> want<00:00:17.349> to<00:00:17.410> show<00:00:17.529> this<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.330> about

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
diameter you want to show this so about

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.439 
diameter you want to show this so about
that<00:00:20.080> size<00:00:20.310> works<00:00:21.310> pretty<00:00:21.730> well<00:00:21.849> you<00:00:22.150> could<00:00:22.330> go

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
that size works pretty well you could go

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.970 
that size works pretty well you could go
a<00:00:22.480> little<00:00:22.779> smaller<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.109> little<00:00:23.380> larger<00:00:23.769> and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
a little smaller a little larger and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.159 
a little smaller a little larger and
then<00:00:24.339> we<00:00:24.460> drilled<00:00:24.730> holes<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:25.449> top<00:00:25.480> third

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
then we drilled holes on the top third

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
then we drilled holes on the top third
of<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:27.189> pipe<00:00:27.849> of<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.419> PVC<00:00:29.050> pipe<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.560> then<00:00:30.099> we

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
of the pipe of the PVC pipe and then we

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.389 
of the pipe of the PVC pipe and then we
drilled<00:00:30.460> holes<00:00:30.730> here<00:00:31.179> about<00:00:31.900> every<00:00:32.379> inch<00:00:32.890> or

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
drilled holes here about every inch or

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.760 
drilled holes here about every inch or
two<00:00:33.910> inches<00:00:34.270> again<00:00:34.629> there's<00:00:35.050> no<00:00:35.170> science<00:00:35.590> to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
two inches again there's no science to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.220 
two inches again there's no science to
this<00:00:35.950> yet<00:00:36.280> we're<00:00:37.120> kind<00:00:37.329> of<00:00:37.420> experimenting<00:00:38.050> but

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
this yet we're kind of experimenting but

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.319 
this yet we're kind of experimenting but
we<00:00:38.379> think<00:00:38.620> this<00:00:38.739> is<00:00:38.800> about<00:00:39.280> felt<00:00:39.820> right<00:00:40.030> and

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
we think this is about felt right and

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.000 
we think this is about felt right and
this<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:40.780> going<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.079> allow<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.320> worms<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.860> go

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
this is going to allow the worms to go

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.010 
this is going to allow the worms to go
in<00:00:42.219> and<00:00:42.370> out<00:00:42.520> of<00:00:42.910> your<00:00:43.210> garden<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.870> you're

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
in and out of your garden and you're

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.439 
in and out of your garden and you're
going<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.199> put<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.440> food<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:44.890> here<00:00:45.309> okay<00:00:46.239> when

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
going to put the food in here okay when

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.689 
going to put the food in here okay when
you<00:00:46.539> drill<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.199> holes<00:00:47.410> you<00:00:48.340> want<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.579> make

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
you drill the holes you want to make

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.540 
you drill the holes you want to make
sure<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:50.410> do<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.739> so<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.219> there's<00:00:51.399> not

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
sure that you do it so that there's not

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.189 
sure that you do it so that there's not
a<00:00:51.579> lot<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.789> birds<00:00:52.120> around<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.629> edges<00:00:52.930> because

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
a lot of birds around the edges because

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.170 
a lot of birds around the edges because
I<00:00:53.230> we<00:00:53.680> think<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.280> would<00:00:54.489> make<00:00:54.550> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
I we think that that would make the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.599 
I we think that that would make the
worms<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:56.140> know<00:00:56.469> could<00:00:56.739> cut<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.070> worms<00:00:57.280> and

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
worms you know could cut the worms and

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.369 
worms you know could cut the worms and
make<00:00:57.699> them<00:00:57.820> uncomfortable<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.719> then<00:00:59.079> if<00:00:59.260> you

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
make them uncomfortable and then if you

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.549 
make them uncomfortable and then if you
wanted<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.769> you<00:00:59.890> could<00:01:00.039> also<00:01:00.070> send<00:01:00.579> it<00:01:01.559> with

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
wanted to you could also send it with

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.499 
wanted to you could also send it with
that<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> sander<00:01:03.609> if<00:01:03.940> you<00:01:04.089> wanted<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.390> make

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
that with a sander if you wanted to make

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:05.730 
that with a sander if you wanted to make
sure<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:04.930> was<00:01:05.049> nice<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.409> smooth

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
sure it was nice and smooth

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.230 
sure it was nice and smooth
okay<00:01:05.979> let's<00:01:06.220> go<00:01:06.340> put<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.100> we<00:01:09.220> dig<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.580> hole<00:01:09.880> in

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
okay let's go put so we dig a hole in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.120 
okay let's go put so we dig a hole in
the<00:01:10.330> garden

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.190 

to<00:01:13.759> put<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.210> ground<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:14.719> this<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.079> our

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
to put it in the ground now this is our

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.990 
to put it in the ground now this is our
worm<00:01:15.409> tower<00:01:15.710> we've<00:01:16.399> already<00:01:16.549> drilled<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
worm tower we've already drilled the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.300 
worm tower we've already drilled the
holes<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.630> bottom<00:01:17.840> third<00:01:18.350> I'm<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:19.189> going

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
holes in the bottom third I'm just going

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.080 
holes in the bottom third I'm just going
to<00:01:19.369> lift<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.880> I've<00:01:20.450> already<00:01:20.659> dug<00:01:21.320> my<00:01:21.500> hole

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
to lift it I've already dug my hole

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.359 
to lift it I've already dug my hole
about<00:01:23.090> as<00:01:23.299> deep<00:01:23.539> as<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.140> holes<00:01:24.380> go<00:01:24.649> maybe<00:01:25.039> just

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
about as deep as the holes go maybe just

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.679 
about as deep as the holes go maybe just
uh<00:01:25.720> about<00:01:26.720> five<00:01:27.320> inches<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:29.240> hole<00:01:29.450> is<00:01:29.659> about

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
uh about five inches the hole is about

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.569 
uh about five inches the hole is about
five<00:01:30.170> inches<00:01:30.470> deeper<00:01:30.799> than<00:01:30.979> where<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.369> holes

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
five inches deeper than where the holes

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.029 
five inches deeper than where the holes
end<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.539> way<00:01:32.689> in<00:01:32.840> other<00:01:33.020> animals<00:01:33.710> and

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
end that way in other animals and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.669 
end that way in other animals and
varmints<00:01:34.549> or<00:01:34.750> insects<00:01:35.750> might<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.170> get<00:01:36.409> in

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
varmints or insects might not get in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.069 
varmints or insects might not get in
into<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.610> holes<00:01:37.850> because<00:01:38.179> those<00:01:38.360> are<00:01:38.569> for<00:01:38.960> the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
into the holes because those are for the

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.850 
into the holes because those are for the
worms<00:01:39.289> now<00:01:40.390> I'm<00:01:41.390> ready<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.170> load<00:01:42.409> it<00:01:42.439> so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
worms now I'm ready to load it so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.649 
worms now I'm ready to load it so
there's<00:01:43.789> already<00:01:43.970> dirt<00:01:44.329> in<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> bottom

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
there's already dirt in the bottom

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.990 
there's already dirt in the bottom
obviously<00:01:45.500> I'm<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.369> put<00:01:46.610> in<00:01:46.759> some

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
obviously I'm going to put in some
