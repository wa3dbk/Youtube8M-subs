00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
first one is called telomerase biotic

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
first one is called telomerase biotic
forger<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:37.020> reason<00:00:37.320> why<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.470> one<00:00:37.830> gets

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
forger on the reason why this one gets

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.630 
forger on the reason why this one gets
third<00:00:38.430> place<00:00:39.200> out<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> top<00:00:41.190> downloads

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
third place out of all the top downloads

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
third place out of all the top downloads
is<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.810> is<00:00:42.990> a<00:00:43.020> well<00:00:43.350> forged<00:00:43.830> track

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is because it is a well forged track

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
is because it is a well forged track
there<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.150> really<00:00:45.480> any<00:00:45.780> bumps<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.470> all<00:00:46.650> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there are no really any bumps at all and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.360 
there are no really any bumps at all and
it's<00:00:47.580> real<00:00:47.850> smooth<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.510> lot<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.590> times<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.010> jumps

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it's real smooth a lot of times it jumps

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.440 
it's real smooth a lot of times it jumps
you<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.730> make<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.240> way<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
you don't make it all the way to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.060 
you don't make it all the way to
downside<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.470> don't<00:00:52.680> give<00:00:52.920> enough

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
downside because you don't give enough

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.510 
downside because you don't give enough
speed<00:00:53.490> for<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.990> but<00:00:54.990> overall<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.190> still<00:00:56.490> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
speed for it but overall it's still a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.560 
speed for it but overall it's still a
really<00:00:57.000> well-made<00:00:57.570> track<00:00:58.910> not<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.120> problems

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
really well-made track not some problems

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.340 
really well-made track not some problems
with<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:01.040> it<00:01:02.040> just<00:01:02.340> gives<00:01:03.000> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> boring<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
with it it just gives kind of boring the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.399 
with it it just gives kind of boring the
track<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.450> yeah<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
track you know yeah I think it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.779 
track you know yeah I think it's
supposed<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.829> like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.009> tournament<00:01:08.549> track

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
supposed to be like a tournament track

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.550 
supposed to be like a tournament track
but<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.240> still<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> boring<00:01:10.049> she's<00:01:10.319> kind

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
but it's still kind of boring she's kind

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.580 
but it's still kind of boring she's kind
of<00:01:10.619> bland<00:01:10.920> uh<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:11.759> many<00:01:12.149> China<00:01:12.780> ascetics

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of bland uh not very many China ascetics

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.200 
of bland uh not very many China ascetics
and<00:01:13.950> stuff<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:16.399> and<00:01:17.399> I<00:01:17.520> also<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:18.090> like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and stuff but and I also don't like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
and stuff but and I also don't like
those<00:01:18.569> circle<00:01:18.960> checkpoints<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.679> would<00:01:20.069> have

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
those circle checkpoints I would have

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
those circle checkpoints I would have
preferred<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.359> the<00:01:21.659> box

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
preferred if you would have in the box

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 
preferred if you would have in the box
or<00:01:22.950> rectangle<00:01:23.729> checkpoints<00:01:24.329> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:25.409> those

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
or rectangle checkpoints I think those

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
or rectangle checkpoints I think those
look<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.829> lot<00:01:25.979> better<00:01:26.219> and<00:01:27.229> just<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:29.520> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
look a lot better and just it just

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
complete checkpoint

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.340 

all<00:01:46.030> right<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.329> this<00:01:46.420> next<00:01:46.479> race<00:01:46.869> track<00:01:47.140> is

all right so this next race track is

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.819 
all right so this next race track is
called<00:01:47.560> iron<00:01:48.009> rice<00:01:48.509> 25.8<00:01:49.509> by<00:01:49.750> iron<00:01:50.049> skull<00:01:51.329> 258

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
called iron rice 25.8 by iron skull 258

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.700 
called iron rice 25.8 by iron skull 258
now<00:01:53.829> this<00:01:54.039> track<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.640> looks<00:01:55.360> real<00:01:55.630> nice<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:56.590> may

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
now this track it looks real nice it may

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.039 
now this track it looks real nice it may
get<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> little<00:01:57.009> bit<00:01:57.340> boring<00:01:57.670> also<00:01:58.090> because

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
get a little bit boring also because

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.469 
get a little bit boring also because
it's<00:01:59.289> just<00:01:59.799> pretty<00:02:00.009> much<00:02:00.220> grill<00:02:00.460> flash<00:02:00.759> but

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
it's just pretty much grill flash but

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's just pretty much grill flash but
one<00:02:01.630> reason<00:02:01.929> why<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.049> like<00:02:02.289> this<00:02:02.470> track<00:02:02.679> better

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
one reason why I like this track better

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.620 
one reason why I like this track better
is<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:03.460> because<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.970> fact<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.450> has<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is just because the fact that it has a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.139 
is just because the fact that it has a
whole<00:02:04.929> bunch<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.229> jumps<00:02:05.649> in<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.700> it's

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
whole bunch of jumps in it and it's

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.289 
whole bunch of jumps in it and it's
outside<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.319> water<00:02:08.619> area<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.459> naturally

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
outside in this water area so naturally

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.150 
outside in this water area so naturally
it<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.599> looks<00:02:10.869> better<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.380> like<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:11.980> little

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it just looks better I like this little
