00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.529
 new today I was the last two 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.460
 not been on the road and now 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.160
 maybe a nice one again 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.090
 Instantly I am done and it is so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.809
 and was on the way to tug and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.489
 catch carp so a nice thing 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.590
 and he gave it a good deal 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.420
 Last night I was with mine 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.559
 friend was on the way and we have 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 make real sick 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.630
 I beat myself and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.230
 gossiped and will be for you 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.000
 now make two films out of it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.790
 in the first part of the see in now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.090
 it's about where to recognize 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.410
 one the sex of a loop 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.510
 she is male or female then 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.930
 There are very good beats points for that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 really can recognize and in the second 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.630
 part of it will come a bit later 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 is it going to be what is it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.729
 difference between the gable and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.770
 sucrose there are many other that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 do not know and it is actually for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.530
 me absolutely no go the other one seems 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.479
 but do not know it so well as so 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.539
 would you go eat the budget with spoon 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.759
 absolutely not that depends I show there 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.709
 I then will the film in the second part 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.909
 but a bit later they come where they are 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.020
 first find some water where I have a few 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 Experiences can come then but 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.600
 today I take that from rausch 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.759
 and I'll say if I have the gable 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.959
 have on the spot since I love no 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.009
 take 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.899
 terrible taste the then 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.499
 Today, the living animal presents the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.499
 fish hereby have the weir with 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.870
 A country's banner is right 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:07.470
 delicious but we catch 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.250
 with the pigs it is now in 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 this movie 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.740
 what is the difference between one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.650
 veil male white yes here we see 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.040
 because the beautiful animals are two beautiful 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.600
 Schleien I have now completely this time 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.060
 aware of this waters has a there 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.920
 a few more taken so I have a lot 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.520
 I was allowed to take along pieces I have 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 took 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.240
 because it really is one of those 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.600
 Overproduction on barns and garages 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.100
 places we take better that is sometimes 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.780
 must be that a few get along because 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.420
 you know all the little carousels 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.340
 tend to burn and there 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.350
 you have to work a bit against 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.840
 I also work under the hood 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.000
 I got the okay and was allowed to remove 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.810
 But watch out for it when you're at one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.370
 otherwise public interest that you one 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.110
 a little bit of the regulated with that 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 is very important because we all want 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.280
 beautiful sparkle almost so first look 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.540
 it was male now it was one 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.690
 barn so great that was a bitch so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.730
 Do not fly if you see them now 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.890
 fish what is the first feature 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.420
 what is noticeable is that one recognizes 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.090
 bigger a little better than those 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.190
 now here 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.850
 I'll show you now down here 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.830
 the female slim form 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.830
 the most important feature is the sheer 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.359
 relatively narrow and you can see it in here 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.049
 also not so similar kind ray the 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.829
 is yes on the outside of the fin 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.930
 Apologizes a bit for the shadow 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.750
 About the sun took off every children 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.400
 place here so to Munich 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.379
 You see , I already had one 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.909
 right bump and is very hard that has 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.419
 one when not bitch here the 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.010
 pretty soft 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:05.730
 here is an important role to come 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.510
 among other things of the enormous fins 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.579
 you see this much bigger and yes 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.819
 a real resin in it that is 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.979
 really firmly on the side 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.989
 Therefore, these boyle come here because 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.370
 the fins are anchored in here 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.340
 meat debris and already there has 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.830
 then maybe a little bit 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.740
 look a very hard and but 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.389
 really hard enough that has that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.479
 females who are not in the case 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.220
 that is relatively so the noble 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.770
 but that is much softer and softer 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.050
 down 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.300
 the families from here yes that is 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.030
 actually the indication of what one recognizes 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.000
 a male and female veil 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:57.139
 female pigs small narrower construction 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.840
 fins little hard jet available 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.240
 male pigs big also fins 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.340
 so if I get bigger 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.259
 then I would be the right big part 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.250
 my big faster than without build 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.500
 has fins then huge and the 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.120
 saarstahl is really very strong, the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620
 is really always an indication for that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.479
 then maybe there will be a few 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.789
 fish you have to look directly then 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.930
 he recognizes the difference but that at 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:30.720
 a sluice really whole up to this 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:34.940
 I'm really working 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.940
 really no fun 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.560
 At any rate, you'll become something of the blood right now 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.240
 difference between male and female 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.550
 female veil is that's really 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.199
 very noticeable but you recognize that first 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.199
 when I'm about 15 10 15 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.699
 centimeter still says it's really good 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.780
 happen through the smaller franco it 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:03.370
 recognize that as long as the ban was 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:06.870
 she is , I've already clanged 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.870
 had already recognized it 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.349
 now you can because when as the next 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.819
 just take a close look 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:17.199
 what, well, then I hope that has you 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.889
 fallen and the art of it 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.810
 take with you and despite heat goes to 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.689
 water but it goes on or boat through 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.259
 a bit of sunscreen on judt up 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.259
 next time
