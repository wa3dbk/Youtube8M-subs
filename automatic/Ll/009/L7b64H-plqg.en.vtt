00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.219
 Good morning, today we are in front again 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.179
 I'm starting 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:25.490
 today is day 4 we are at dukla marin 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.839
 is the christoph leitl hello and we 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.990
 Just wanted to hear what you like 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:32.029
 our new spectators are yes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.239
 always a bit interested in what 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.920
 there is a new and perfect trade fair yes us 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.399
 Here we are also presenting new for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.649
 many of us see the multi reactor 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.170
 input here already how it works 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.760
 But a talent reactor can be due 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.230
 the design for very many 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.300
 different materials used 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.430
 are these are very big plus 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 means I can once for our bio 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.649
 use pellets 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.719
 I can do that with coal as well 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.399
 I can fill with iron oxide 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.180
 use is with us fund the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.550
 But I can also use it for 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500
 zeolites around nitrogen in big ones 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.570
 aquarium itself to bind 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.260
 I'll show you how he does 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.260
 is working 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 very easy to open the core piece in 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.010
 The multi reactor itself is two 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.510
 different floorboards that is 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 we once have a bottom plate with 3 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.020
 mm holes a bottom plate with 2 mm 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.060
 holes 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.070
 that means I have a material that the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.340
 So hovering in motion 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.020
 like our bio pellets wants the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.580
 bottom plate three millimeters down 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.890
 I just have something stronger 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.979
 I have materials from 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.470
 a very fine size as an example 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.880
 iron oxide I just turn it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.420
 that translates to it and can be very 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.090
 work well that 's really a good one 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.500
 Solution is a practical solution for 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.149
 I have the big advantage I 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.110
 can the impeccable as he lacks in the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.610
 aquarium part 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.580
 I can also filter them though 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.250
 insert swamp or simply the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.970
 simply add a system to the system 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.520
 Aquarium 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.310
 and they are the accessories 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.500
 accessories are completely included that means we 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.910
 have two silicone hoses here 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.240
 about a half of a half 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.340
 meter 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.110
 that's enough 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 still adapter pieces on 12 16 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.070
 that I pump any commercial 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 can connect directly to the filter 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.550
 is a great thing about carefree package 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.560
 almost exactly 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.660
 So great, too, this medium silicone and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.580
 of course, hose it nicely 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.130
 migrations to escape the listener 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.020
 next easier from the laying is 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.850
 simply high quality corresponds 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.620
 in the end , the multi succeeded 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.950
 Reactor is suitable for a basin 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.950
 size from 200 to 800 liters a dependent 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.470
 little bit of what burden itself in the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.300
 aquarium in it is used as a filter pump as 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.250
 For bio pellets we recommend 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.530
 in power between 600 and 1000 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.200
 liter pet ct fund so an iron grid 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.390
 oxide used we recommend one 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.160
 performance between 200 and 300 liters 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 hour should not be so strong that 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.470
 that's not too confused 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.580
 makes the presenter we present here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.750
 first time at the fair ok and in the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.370
 hope that he will soon in all 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.260
 there are 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 a price idea asking price 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.280
 quite interesting for the end user 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.880
 be really hard 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 799 euros that's good 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.000
 yes and visually very appealing and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.430
 as I said just from hand yes 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.330
 we are still at the shelf and here 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.960
 we see a few elements like here what 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.860
 is 9 of them 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.380
 yes we have redesigned the 24 series 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.780
 for the nano range of the dosage 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.170
 very customer friendly 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.660
 friendly a drop to 20 liters too 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.020
 very important here are the reactive ones 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.540
 trace elements once iodine iron and 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.370
 Strontium is also very important for 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.300
 smaller aquariums become very common 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.370
 forgotten are amino acids problem 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.120
 in amino acids so the coral can 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.260
 Although amino acids on the feed intake 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.230
 but are not in the synthesize 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.820
 capable of synthesizing certain amino acids 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.010
 and just these essential ones 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.980
 amino acids are too many every day 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.240
 really to be happening you have 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.870
 already in hand you still have here 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.250
 Severin like Mary is a whole 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.160
 new production is a 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.810
 water conditioner and care products 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.420
 we put here as highly active 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.520
 active ingredient clean optimizes one of itself 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.849
 characterized by being very large 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.479
 quantities of nitrogen can bind immediately 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.610
 that is used in the aquarium will 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.099
 He immediately relieves nitrogen with it 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.360
 actually the whole system explained 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.709
 the water we still have in ours 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.809
 To have care products with it is micro 

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:58.360
 sighted aragonite and some 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:00.159
 trace elements in addition to the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.619
 Corals grew but also promote the reputation 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.300
 from kalkar and this is natural 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.509
 desired to others all 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.610
 taken klien can only optimized 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.009
 the following say extremely large surface 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.490
 that is the surface of over 700 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.740
 square on gram and thereby have 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.919
 we always have the very strong reaction 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.569
 clear in the water itself is effective 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.729
 actually following the nitrogen the 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.309
 get used to and and will be later 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.729
 written off by the cleaners this 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:33.069
 marin is complementary to our liquid 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.019
 line which trace elements or 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:37.209
 carbonates calcium and magnesium 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:39.369
 includes an additional care product 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.469
 he is up to 100 for the repair 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.819
 natural active ingredient used 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.430
 becomes 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:47.600
 just for more sensitive ferrari with 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.360
 special stony corals sps or lps 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.700
 super christoph thank you very much no 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.530
 Thank you very much that you are under 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.140
 our viewers here are the newest 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.500
 trends or with these products from dukla 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.960
 Mary presented you were there 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.820
 interesting things here 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.670
 and we wish you a nice one 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.440
 day and the last good business 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.160
 makes thanks for the visit and beautiful mountain 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.160
 Thank you
