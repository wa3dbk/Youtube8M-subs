the QM launch your X shown here is
slightly<00:03:05.739> different<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:07.030> version<00:03:07.329> we

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
slightly different in this version we

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.199 
slightly different in this version we
restrict<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:08.769> axis<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.430> rotation<00:03:09.579> which

restrict one axis of rotation which

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.349 
restrict one axis of rotation which
