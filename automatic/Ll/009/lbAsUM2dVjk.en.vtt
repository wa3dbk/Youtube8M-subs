in<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.220> show<00:00:02.399> you<00:00:02.460> how

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.660 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.360> 120<00:00:04.230> degree<00:00:04.589> pleat<00:00:04.890> intersection

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
to do a 120 degree pleat intersection

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.670 
to do a 120 degree pleat intersection
which<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.899> basic<00:00:07.259> techniques

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
which is one of the basic techniques

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.290 
which is one of the basic techniques
used<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.340> tessellations<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.420> origami<00:00:11.300> we

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
used for tessellations in origami we

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.799 
used for tessellations in origami we
need<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.630> start<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.650> triangle<00:00:13.980> grid<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
need to start with a triangle grid and

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
need to start with a triangle grid and
advise<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.590> least<00:00:16.859> eight<00:00:17.310> divisions

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
advise you have at least eight divisions

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.840 
advise you have at least eight divisions
if<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.080> don't<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.500> how<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> fold<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.550> triangle

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
if you don't know how to fold a triangle

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.410 
if you don't know how to fold a triangle
grid<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.750> check<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.529> other<00:00:22.710> videos

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
grid just check one of my other videos

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.839 
grid just check one of my other videos
first<00:00:24.420> choose<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.500> intersection<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.550> creases

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
first choose an intersection of creases

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.970 
first choose an intersection of creases
on<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> grid<00:00:27.570> around<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> pleats

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
on the grid around which the pleats

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.600 
on the grid around which the pleats
should<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.340> based<00:00:30.080> then<00:00:31.080> locate<00:00:31.830> three

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
should be based then locate three

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
should be based then locate three
creases<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.579> enclose<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.809> 120

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
creases so that they enclose a 120

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.540 
creases so that they enclose a 120
degree<00:00:38.040> angle<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.450> other<00:00:39.660> words<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:41.070> full

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
degree angle or in other words to full

degree angle or in other words to full
draw<00:00:41.969> triangles<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.980> between<00:00:45.710> for<00:00:46.710> these

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
draw triangles are in between for these

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.100 
draw triangles are in between for these
three<00:00:47.460> creases<00:00:49.070> make<00:00:50.070> mountain<00:00:50.789> folds

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.510 

depending<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> folded<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> grid

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
depending on how you folded the grid

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.500 
depending on how you folded the grid
these<00:00:57.360> already<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:58.020> mountain<00:00:58.530> folds<00:00:59.300> for<00:01:00.300> me

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
these already are mountain folds for me

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
these already are mountain folds for me
they<00:01:00.750> aren't<00:01:00.989> yet<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.789> along

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they aren't yet so I'm just going along

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.219 
they aren't yet so I'm just going along
the<00:01:03.300> creases<00:01:05.270> changing<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> direction<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the creases changing the direction of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.770 
the creases changing the direction of
the<00:01:07.860> crease<00:01:08.659> like<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:11.299> next<00:01:12.299> we're<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the crease like so next we're going to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.240 
the crease like so next we're going to
go<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.290> along<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> grid<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.630> fold<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
go again along the grid to fold one of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
go again along the grid to fold one of
these<00:01:17.460> mountain<00:01:18.240> folds<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.180> putting<00:01:21.180> two

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
these mountain folds kind of putting two

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.460 
these mountain folds kind of putting two
layers<00:01:21.930> together<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.869> those<00:01:24.869> two<00:01:25.229> layers

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
layers together and those two layers

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
layers together and those two layers
will<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.009> folded<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:27.320> along<00:01:28.759> this<00:01:29.759> grid

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
will be folded down along this grid

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.160 
will be folded down along this grid
crease<00:01:33.229> then<00:01:34.400> these<00:01:35.400> two<00:01:35.759> layers<00:01:36.020> will<00:01:37.020> be

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
crease then these two layers will be

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.069 
crease then these two layers will be
folded<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:38.060> along<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.780> grid<00:01:40.619> crease<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
folded up along this grid crease and

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.770 
folded up along this grid crease and
these<00:01:43.079> two<00:01:43.409> layers<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.070> folded<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
these two layers will be folded over to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.789 
these two layers will be folded over to
the<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.110> along<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:48.090> grid<00:01:48.689> crease<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the right along this grid crease so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
the right along this grid crease so
they're<00:01:49.979> always<00:01:50.159> parallel<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.899> mountain

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
they're always parallel to the mountain

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.520 
they're always parallel to the mountain
folds<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:54.860> if<00:01:55.860> you've<00:01:56.070> got<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.579> three<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
folds so if you've got these three you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
folds so if you've got these three you
can<00:01:58.770> fold<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.840> first<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.670> maybe<00:02:02.670> by

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
can fold the first one over maybe by

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.429 
can fold the first one over maybe by
bringing<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.229> layer<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:05.630> making<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:07.049> valley

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
bringing this layer up making a valley

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.110 
bringing this layer up making a valley
fold<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:09.420> grid<00:02:09.869> crease

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
fold on that grid crease

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.850 
fold on that grid crease
and<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:14.250> again<00:02:14.519> bring<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.269> paper<00:02:15.720> up<00:02:15.989> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and here again bring the paper up to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.619 
and here again bring the paper up to
make<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.340> valley<00:02:17.849> fold<00:02:18.209> along<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:20.629> grid

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
make a valley fold along that grid

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.190 
make a valley fold along that grid
crease<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:24.980> put<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.099> over<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.640> right

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
crease and put it over to the right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.800 
crease and put it over to the right
again<00:02:28.400> making<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.610> valley<00:02:29.970> fold<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:32.540> then<00:02:33.540> when

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
again making a valley fold and then when

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.979 
again making a valley fold and then when
you<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.080> those<00:02:34.290> valley<00:02:34.620> fold<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.160> place

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
you have those valley fold in place

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.869 
you have those valley fold in place
almost<00:02:36.989> naturally<00:02:37.769> all<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.640> will

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
almost naturally all of this will

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.289 
almost naturally all of this will
collapse<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.349> will<00:02:40.470> see<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.299> right

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
collapse and you will see that right

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.990 
collapse and you will see that right
here<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:44.010> fold<00:02:44.430> down<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.760> crease

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
here we fold down this is the crease

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
here we fold down this is the crease
you're<00:02:48.239> going<00:02:48.450> along<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.810> Valley<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.069> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
you're going along and Valley and it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.440 
you're going along and Valley and it
extends<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> way<00:02:51.959> up<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.450> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
extends all the way up there and you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.949 
extends all the way up there and you
push<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.380> down<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.879> valley<00:02:57.090> fold<00:02:57.480> all

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
push that down so it's a valley fold all

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.699 
push that down so it's a valley fold all
the<00:02:58.470> way<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:58.980> thus<00:02:59.970> making<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.900> small

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
the way through thus making a small

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.250 
the way through thus making a small
mountain<00:03:02.160> fold<00:03:02.780> right<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:05.720> then<00:03:06.720> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
mountain fold right here and then you
