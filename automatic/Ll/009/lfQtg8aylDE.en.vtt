wanted to talk about in this video is
that<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.989> started<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.190> started<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.059> practice

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
that I started I've started to practice

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
that I started I've started to practice
90-degree<00:00:37.950> drifts<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> reverse<00:00:39.420> entry

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
90-degree drifts and reverse entry

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.130 
90-degree drifts and reverse entry
drifts<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:41.219> getting<00:00:41.910> better<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.690> them

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
drifts and I'm getting better at them

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.000 
drifts and I'm getting better at them
slowly<00:00:44.750> some<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.320> probably<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
slowly some of my this is probably my

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.540 
slowly some of my this is probably my
best<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.899> 90-degree<00:00:48.899> drift<00:00:49.170> yet<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.430> my

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
best a 90-degree drift yet I was in my

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.350 
best a 90-degree drift yet I was in my
lexus<00:00:51.030> GS<00:00:51.420> 350<00:00:51.809> f<00:00:52.140> sport<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.149> basically<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lexus GS 350 f sport and basically you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
lexus GS 350 f sport and basically you
can<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> third<00:00:55.230> person<00:00:56.090> game

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
can see it from the third person game

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.910 
can see it from the third person game
view<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.660> here<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.660> it's

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
view right here it's I don't know it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.450 
view right here it's I don't know it's
it's<00:01:01.920> past<00:01:02.309> 90<00:01:02.850> degrees<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.159> but<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's past 90 degrees it's so but it I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's past 90 degrees it's so but it I
don't<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> would<00:01:06.150> consider<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
don't know if you would consider it a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.410 
don't know if you would consider it a
reverse<00:01:07.350> entry<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:09.180> being

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
reverse entry I don't know if just being

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.840 
reverse entry I don't know if just being
past<00:01:09.840> 90<00:01:10.350> degrees<00:01:10.680> automatically<00:01:11.430> makes<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
past 90 degrees automatically makes it a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.960 
past 90 degrees automatically makes it a
reverse<00:01:12.150> entry<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.850> other

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
reverse entry or if there's some other

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
reverse entry or if there's some other
thing<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.380> need<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
thing that you need to do to make it a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
thing that you need to do to make it a
reverse<00:01:17.430> entry<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> did<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
reverse entry and I did go up on the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.410 
reverse entry and I did go up on the
curb<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.700> said<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:21.119> just

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
think they look really good in montages

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
think they look really good in montages
and<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> them<00:01:39.450> online<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.770> mean

solution for fixing that problem in

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.020 
solution for fixing that problem in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
think that would solve the problem of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.820 
think that would solve the problem of
these<00:03:57.840> people<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.230> come<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.590> drift

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
these people that come in to drift

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.979 
these people that come in to drift
matches<00:03:59.250> with<00:03:59.730> mom's<00:04:00.180> cars<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.780> stuff<00:04:00.930> just

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
matches with mom's cars and stuff just

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.259 
matches with mom's cars and stuff just
to<00:04:01.290> smash<00:04:01.650> people<00:04:01.920> up<00:04:02.220> because<00:04:02.580> they're<00:04:03.090> never

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
to smash people up because they're never

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.580 
to smash people up because they're never

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.580 
they're not scoring any points and I
think<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:06.690> would<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:06.840> separate<00:04:07.470> the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
of ranking system to get it to work

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.180 
of ranking system to get it to work
perfectly<00:04:47.300> because<00:04:48.300> people<00:04:48.599> may<00:04:49.229> you<00:04:49.710> know<00:04:49.830> if

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
perfectly because people may you know if

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.999 
perfectly because people may you know if

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
if a troll is committed enough they

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.089 
if a troll is committed enough they
might<00:04:53.039> boost<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:54.270> get<00:04:54.389> into<00:04:54.810> level<00:04:55.770> two<00:04:55.919> level

three<00:04:56.250> drift<00:04:56.610> matches<00:04:56.940> but<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.419> highly<00:04:58.169> doubt

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
three drift matches but I highly doubt

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.790 
three drift matches but I highly doubt
that<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.800> mean<00:04:59.509> it's<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.840> mainly<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.560> people
