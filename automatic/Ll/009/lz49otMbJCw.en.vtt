00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 here we are as you saw it while 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 federico and georgette been doing 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.519
 shopping 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.530
 we instead enter this column 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.870
 that the title of my fashion and we call 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.300
 claudia carducci who will reveal us today 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.289
 new secrets what we know 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 day then what teaches us today 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 then today we will make these bands 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.019
 circles the one that went very pretty 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.649
 which are very nice for the summer 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 because they make them look a little sparkling and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.180
 then the peculiarity is that having the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
 circle as a base if we do n't put them 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.989
 at the sea 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.539
 we have no need to come and stay 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 always combed for that hold the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.570
 hair and do not fly away because they are well 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 fixed for now is okay then what is there 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.699
 you are then what we are going to achieve 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.609
 these headbands and headbands head scarves 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.370
 we need circles that don't 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.979
 we use more or we can go 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.380
 to buy short if he knows that these already 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 they are covered but they buy that of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.310
 normal plastic you can't choose the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 shape that makes enough choices 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.470
 grow the audios because you like the a8 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.790
 then some fabric glue you can 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.189
 choose a simple one with the for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.439
 fabrics or hot glue today 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.900
 this is the silicone this is the glue 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.900
 and with silicone and today we will not use 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.860
 the glue the bullfight leadership that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.610
 site data and then needle and thread to finish 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.920
 me and then the scarves that we don't use anymore 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.740
 and therefore that we can use for 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.330
 to cover these is therefore how civil 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 then place a small circle at the end 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.390
 so pretty it looks I actually have 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.990
 spent only on the glue I didn't have in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.640
 house in the circles I had headscarves them 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.060
 I had scarves there that I didn't use anymore 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.280
 the cut golds and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.899
 we will use them to do these at the time 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 let's stop immediately at a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.390
 work ok here i saw you 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.520
 on the eagle the sewing then curing site 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 and glued it in half because it was about 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.690
 20 cm more then a coppola e 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 pasted dolo so it depends on the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 that is, length and width km 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.810
 however now it has become 10 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.019
 about centimeters 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.880
 we measure the goal that we are here 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.650
 in half and we begin to put the glue on 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.959
 circle that I keep it for a sul 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 circles half the cola in the plane 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.060
 inside of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.060
 so you can't see it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.489
 and at this point because this is one 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.010
 transparent fabric glue from 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.940
 so naturally it disappears in yes later 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:59.489
 after having it then we start to paste 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.269
 certain that this band made this way does 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.180
 very hair fashion and that was things 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.459
 that they brought to goats over the years 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.580
 fifty is true that if they complete you in 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.910
 help help admire here we start a 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.519
 paste to do see gross and indeed you 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.530
 help even a little see we have the glue 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:26.370
 we also glue well on this side 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.480
 so here too look to put some back 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:35.030
 even the body line does not hold the glue 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.030
 and we can start closing 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.500
 and this is a very easy game 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.530
 it takes really there in two minutes e 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.209
 then something a given and understanding not only 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.080
 it's fun but it's also useful because 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.620
 actually in summer the hair fly 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.400
 away as if it were nothing and therefore then 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.549
 come out of the water to be able to bathe 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.950
 you can put this strap on 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.260
 circle and it was immediately glamorous but at the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.900
 the same time I like the throat 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.750
 print goal has therefore this is the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 very nice result with me where 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.930
 we want everything and be sure exactly 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:24.000
 me death if we want we can put 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.919
 we fix a punticino with con lagolo 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.190
 and the result is this 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.490
 then here I am already prepared others yes 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.729
 so inside you sew a 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.530
 little yes yes yes yes yes yes way that for 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.919
 example here I set them with a 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.900
 punticino is nice the circle below 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.120
 here so that then when they put it 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.930
 then you can not even throw precarious 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.280
 even scrambling so I have it 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.470
 worn I gave the hair have 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.250
 tied behind the hair and this is the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.500
 result 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.690
 very nice i want to go too 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.300
 motorcycle so he had a trip in there 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.849

 complicated as they say to be realized 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.199
