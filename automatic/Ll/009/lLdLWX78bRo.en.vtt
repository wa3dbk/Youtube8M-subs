there's a moes there's enemies and

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
there's a moes there's enemies and
that's<00:00:06.870> because<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.259> decided<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:07.980> instead<00:00:08.370> of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
that's because I decided that instead of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.549 
that's because I decided that instead of
building<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.240> game<00:00:09.420> from<00:00:09.719> scratch<00:00:09.929> writing

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
building the game from scratch writing

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.650 
building the game from scratch writing
it<00:00:10.679> myself<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.280> decided<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.300> would<00:00:12.360> buy<00:00:12.630> a

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
it myself I decided that I would buy a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.169 
it myself I decided that I would buy a
game<00:00:13.170> engine<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.860> then<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.580> tweak<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.000> game

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
game engine and then just tweak the game

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.599 
game engine and then just tweak the game
engine<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.900> how<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> wanted<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
engine to how I wanted it to be in that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
engine to how I wanted it to be in that
way<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.240> focus<00:00:18.449> more<00:00:18.779> time<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.260> improving

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
way I can focus more time on improving

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
way I can focus more time on improving
the<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.340> making<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.730> game<00:00:20.850> awesome

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the game and making the game awesome

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
the game and making the game awesome
rather<00:00:21.960> than<00:00:22.260> having<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> write<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> entire

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
rather than having to write the entire

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.700 
rather than having to write the entire
game<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.970> by<00:00:24.180> scratch<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.380> when<00:00:25.560> I've

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
game out by scratch and then when I've

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
game out by scratch and then when I've
done<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.760> improve<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> game

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
done that then I can improve the game

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
done that then I can improve the game
and<00:00:27.660> add<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> want<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.099> it's

and add it to how I want it and it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
and add it to how I want it and it's
just<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> save<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> time<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just going to save a lot of time it's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.479

going to bring you guys a great game

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.330 
going to bring you guys a great game
quicker<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.510> would<00:00:34.230> still<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> build<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
quicker I would still like to build a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
quicker I would still like to build a
game<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:36.000> scratch<00:00:36.290> maybe<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> future

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
game from scratch maybe in the future

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.979 
game from scratch maybe in the future
but<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> right<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.570> lot<00:00:39.750> easier

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
but as of right now is just a lot easier

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.780 
but as of right now is just a lot easier
just<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> buy<00:00:40.680> an<00:00:40.739> engine<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.579> already

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
just to buy an engine that can already

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
just to buy an engine that can already
shootin<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.540> already<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> stuff<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
shootin all already do all the stuff and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.490 
shootin all already do all the stuff and
have<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.100> coding<00:00:44.430> done<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
have all the coding done for me so that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.440 
have all the coding done for me so that
I<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.370> back<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.879> change<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I can just then go back and change and I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
I can just then go back and change and I
have<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> stuff<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.460> in

have the stuff that I want right here in

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
have the stuff that I want right here in
the<00:00:51.090> background<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> simple<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:53.399> i

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the background there's a simple game i

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.459 
the background there's a simple game i
made<00:00:53.850> i<00:00:54.149> came<00:00:54.539> across<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.989> script<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
made i came across the script that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
made i came across the script that
randomly<00:00:55.800> spawned<00:00:56.219> zombies<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> certain

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
randomly spawned zombies at a certain

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
randomly spawned zombies at a certain
location<00:00:57.449> however<00:00:58.379> many<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.190> put<00:00:59.489> i<00:00:59.609> think

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
location however many want i put i think

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
location however many want i put i think
5002<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:00.960> only<00:01:01.079> five<00:01:01.320> thousand<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.010> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
5002 there's only five thousand so if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.539 
5002 there's only five thousand so if
you<00:01:02.280> kill<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:03.530> jeje<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.129> then

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you kill them all jeje for you but then

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.070 
you kill them all jeje for you but then
you'll<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.909> will<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.479> nothing<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.990> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you'll just will be nothing because you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
you'll just will be nothing because you
go<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> zombies<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.950> arranged<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> five

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
go to zombies but I arranged it to five

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
go to zombies but I arranged it to five
thousand<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.900> odds<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.409> very

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
thousand so the odds of that are very

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
thousand so the odds of that are very
slim<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> hit<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:13.260> abled<00:01:13.680> in

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
slim that you hit that I just abled in

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
slim that you hit that I just abled in
this<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.790> abled<00:01:15.210> movement<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
this one I just abled movement so you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
this one I just abled movement so you
can't<00:01:16.409> walk<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.979> can't<00:01:17.009> jump<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.759> can't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
can't walk you can't jump you can't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.609 
can't walk you can't jump you can't
Crouch<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> only<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
Crouch you can only look around and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.440 
Crouch you can only look around and
shoot<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> zombies<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> sniper<00:01:20.790> rifle<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
shoot the zombies and sniper rifle and I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020 
shoot the zombies and sniper rifle and I
think<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.770> fun<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> top<00:01:23.850> right

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
think it's pretty fun on the top right

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
think it's pretty fun on the top right
you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.479> time<00:01:24.780> played<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.650> right

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you can see time played which is right

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
you can see time played which is right
now<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.360> 88<00:01:27.360> 89<00:01:27.900> seconds<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.630> very<00:01:30.630> fluid

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
now about 88 89 seconds and very fluid

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.749 
now about 88 89 seconds and very fluid
is<00:01:31.259> mainly<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> testing<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is mainly just a testing thing but I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
is mainly just a testing thing but I
figured<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> guys<00:01:33.240> would<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
figured you guys would like this this is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.800 
figured you guys would like this this is
not<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> full<00:01:35.009> game<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.400> look<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.810> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
not what the full game will look like it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539 
not what the full game will look like it
will<00:01:36.930> kind<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.409> similar<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.280> but

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
will kind of be similar to this but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.160 
will kind of be similar to this but
you'll<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.909> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.090> move<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.020> won't

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you'll be able to move and you won't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
you'll be able to move and you won't
just<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.740> spot<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> stuff<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just be in one spot and stuff like that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
just be in one spot and stuff like that
so<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.380> making

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so you kind of know what I'm making

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.950 
so you kind of know what I'm making
towards<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.700> least<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> gamers<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
towards or at least one of the gamers I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.030 
towards or at least one of the gamers I
would<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> couple<00:01:46.950> different

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
game modes but so one it will obviously

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.200 
game modes but so one it will obviously
be<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.649> call<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> duty<00:01:50.159> zombies<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.790> I'm
