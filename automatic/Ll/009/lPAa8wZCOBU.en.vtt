further<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.960> noticed<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.790> I<00:00:08.790> was<00:00:08.940> able<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
further I noticed that I was able to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.760 
further I noticed that I was able to
observe<00:00:09.840> switching<00:00:10.469> transients<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:15.560> the<00:00:16.560> amp

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
observe switching transients in the amp

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.330 
observe switching transients in the amp

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
after the coupling capacitor I'm not

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
after the coupling capacitor I'm not
sure<00:00:34.079> how<00:00:34.469> good<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> come<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sure how good it's going to come out and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.020 
sure how good it's going to come out and
with<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> camera<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> off

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
with the camera but we can see the off

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.729 
with the camera but we can see the off
transient<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:41.059> we<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> quick<00:00:43.350> spike

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
transient here we can see a quick spike

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.970 
transient here we can see a quick spike
and<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.239> output<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> tube<00:00:46.379> coming

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and the output of the tube coming

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
and the output of the tube coming
through<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> coupling<00:00:47.670> capacitor<00:00:48.710> C<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
through the coupling capacitor C a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.569 
through the coupling capacitor C a
smaller<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.930> larger<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.579> was

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
smaller one here a larger one here I was

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090 
smaller one here a larger one here I was
kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> surprised<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.100> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
kind of surprised to see this the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.020 
kind of surprised to see this the
rectifiers<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.059> diet<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.980> two<00:00:59.989> regular

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
rectifiers in this diet are two regular

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.060 
rectifiers in this diet are two regular
for<00:01:03.030> double-oh-seven<00:01:03.930> s<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.979> series<00:01:05.600> without

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
for double-oh-seven s in series without

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
for double-oh-seven s in series without
snubbers<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
snubbers but this is about as good as I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.969 
snubbers but this is about as good as I
can<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> show<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:12.590> with<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:15.450> scope

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
can get it to show up with this scope

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.520 
can get it to show up with this scope
but<00:01:16.979> I'm<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:19.650> could

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.609 

see<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:27.299> sure<00:01:28.299> how<00:01:28.570> gates<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.260> show<00:01:29.470> up

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
see here sure how gates going to show up

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.399 
see here sure how gates going to show up
again<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.430> camera<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.510> can<00:01:31.659> definitely<00:01:31.869> see

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
again this camera you can definitely see

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.810 
again this camera you can definitely see
a<00:01:32.440> ringing<00:01:33.570> coming<00:01:34.570> out<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:37.619> coupling

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
a ringing coming out of coupling

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.910 
a ringing coming out of coupling
capacitor<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.000> first<00:01:40.210> stage<00:01:40.530> let's<00:01:41.530> see<00:01:41.740> they

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
capacitor the first stage let's see they

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.730 
capacitor the first stage let's see they
got<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.310> point<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:46.170> 200<00:01:47.170> that's

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
got this on it's a point to 200 that's

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:59.340 
got this on it's a point to 200 that's
20<00:01:50.610> microseconds<00:01:51.610> per<00:01:51.700> division<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.140 

the<00:01:59.890> ringing<00:02:00.310> seems<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:01.060> be<00:02:01.240> up<00:02:01.810> down<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.799> pub

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
the ringing seems to be up down and pub

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.850 
the ringing seems to be up down and pub
play<00:02:04.150> microsites<00:02:04.659> per<00:02:04.960> division<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.470> needs<00:02:05.680> it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
play microsites per division it needs it

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.510 
play microsites per division it needs it
it's<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.360> 5-4<00:02:07.360> tick<00:02:07.630> one<00:02:08.380> two<00:02:08.739> three<00:02:09.610> one<00:02:11.520> cycle

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it's a 5-4 tick one two three one cycle

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's a 5-4 tick one two three one cycle
seems<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.000> about<00:02:13.209> 15<00:02:13.750> micro<00:02:14.170> seconds<00:02:15.120> which

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
seems to be about 15 micro seconds which

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.880 
seems to be about 15 micro seconds which
is<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.480> pretty<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.739> would

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
is actually pretty well and that would

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.020 
is actually pretty well and that would
be<00:02:24.000> about<00:02:25.000> 50<00:02:25.420> killer<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.050> thing<00:02:27.030> but

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
be about 50 killer it's the thing but

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.340 
be about 50 killer it's the thing but
very<00:02:28.209> interesting<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.959> actually<00:02:29.110> see

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
very interesting you can actually see

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.059 
very interesting you can actually see
the<00:02:29.709> ringing<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.370> diet<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.970> coming

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the ringing of the diet is coming

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.160 
the ringing of the diet is coming
through<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.130> coupling<00:02:33.670> capacitor<00:02:34.209> at<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.720> gain

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
through a coupling capacitor at the gain

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.910 
through a coupling capacitor at the gain
stage<00:02:35.500> farthest<00:02:35.920> away<00:02:36.069> from<00:02:36.340> power<00:02:36.489> supply<00:02:36.940> Oh

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.060 

interesting<00:02:41.920> thanks<00:02:42.640> again<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:43.030> watching
