whole card reviewing thing has gotten a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.790 
whole card reviewing thing has gotten a
bit<00:00:46.260> repetitive<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.930> guess<00:00:48.930> I've<00:00:49.200> been<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.500> bit

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
bit repetitive I guess I've been a bit

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
bit repetitive I guess I've been a bit
sick<00:00:51.260> I've<00:00:52.260> been<00:00:52.590> watching<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.039> new<00:00:53.430> anime

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
sick I've been watching some new anime

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
sick I've been watching some new anime
and<00:00:54.620> there's<00:00:55.620> been<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.250> distinct<00:00:56.969> lack<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and there's been a distinct lack of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.209 
and there's been a distinct lack of
awesome<00:00:57.960> food<00:00:58.199> around<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> house<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.219> those

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
awesome food around the house so those

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.119 
awesome food around the house so those
are<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.699> probably<00:01:03.260> contributing<00:01:04.260> factors<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
are all probably contributing factors to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820 
are all probably contributing factors to
why<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.420> didn't<00:01:06.900> feel<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.229> putting<00:01:07.740> up

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
why I just didn't feel like putting up

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.830 
why I just didn't feel like putting up
videos<00:01:09.590> anyway<00:01:10.590> enough<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.189> me

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
videos anyway enough about me
