00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 greetings and hammering for everyone here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.509
 so hammer and finally we finally have 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 active aim after a series of days 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.630
 hoping it looked like it was not moving 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.360
 that we were 92% 94-95 and then a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 fail with a few purple squares that then 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 you will see finally we have a version of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.380
 stephen that works perfectly and without 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 weird things good as we always have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 here the download link we give to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.099
 jump advertising takes us directly 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.070
 to the mega website we accept the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.899
 conditions and we download it into the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 folder that we want as 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 I always have already downloaded it 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.660
 I go directly to the folder is the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.059
 ultra to 2 the valid because the a1 has 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.120
 there were certain problems we extracted it in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 the folder that we want, I'm going to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.050
 catch it I'm going to move it here to the folder 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.290
 I have with the minecraft 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 I have it already installed you have it here 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.149
 in the very mini rock craft folder what 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 I have already installed good the only thing that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.019
 you will have to do is as usual 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.019
 run ais 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 you expect the launcher to work 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.660
 and when it is already installed you give 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.870
 play and the typical install the minecraft at 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.820
 what do we have to do then? 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.510
 simple we go to the minecraft folder 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.990
 the easiest thing is here to put asterisks 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.710
 app data asterisk 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.790
 we go to the roaming folder 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.930
 minecraft version and here we copy the 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.100
 folder 16 2 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.100
 and we modified it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.520
 for example we can about 628 this 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.480
 I have here below is basically for 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.690
 show you later 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.230
 here we also edit the two 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.580
 records 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.100
 162 hops and the j are also about 62 pop 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.020
 as I already showed you in the other video and 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.540
 now the third step as long as it is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.330
 open the file select a program 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.180
 of the sandpaper and open it with notepad and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.180
 here in the idea we put also ok 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.130
 basically I do not find it with ader module 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.190
 nor comfort because you are seeing problems 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.450
 of incompatibility in all ways like 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.430
 you have already seen can be installed 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.610
 none of without any support of 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.700
 excited good this the hard point what 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.140
 open with winrar 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.160
 we delete the meta link folder 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.160
 and we become 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.290
 here where is the folder with the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 opd download and find what we select 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.510
 everything with control and we drag and paste 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.989
 we close 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.989
 we become here mimic premium 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 we execute 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.500
 here in edit profile 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.050
 we select the one we want in the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 case is 1.6 and we give you to save and you 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.680
 we play 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.890
 I will not know how to score without problems 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.220
 we put the options as you see adjustments 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.830
 of video and this should sound like 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.959
 steve aim I usually just put 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.240
 graphics in fast to lighting the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.850
 I leave just as it is very lightning the same 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.130
 the brightness puts it in half the 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.870
 fog in fast because I've put it 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.730
 ever in fans and you do not notice the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.090
 difference the textures of the server 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.920
 activated in details the clouds I like 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.430
 that have thickness so I put it in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.590
 fancy the trees in fast the water in 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.440
 fast because you practically do not notice 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.480
 the difference hits I put them in 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.269
 fans and because well when you throw a hit in 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.510
 the floor looks a lot cooler the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.640
 grass in fast and rain and snow 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.569
 also in fast because the truth is 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.579
 that they are pretty 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.280
 then the animations all activated 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.439
 as always the distance of render and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.159
 I usually put it in pharr the 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:17.799
 performance at maximum fps 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.930
 opencel in fast charge of chung 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.669
 multi core if you have a computer with 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.009
 more than two good cores with more than one 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.199
 core this to where the distance to the 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.460
 that the fog starts this according to what 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.819
 I like you 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 in quality this is not active I never 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:37.720
 basically because there is no difference that 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.509
 yes to make the water look clearer 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.550
 the grass better you do not notice difference and 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.710
 example just like the sources 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.230
 that you lower the fps and you do not notice the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.430
 difference 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.710
 they are color yes 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.710
 connect detectors to fast 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.740
 in random mobs who has also tried it 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.090
 I always put it off because when 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.540
 I've had it in an engine has not noticed 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.540
 no difference 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:11.860
 we give you to accept 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:16.720
 and in performance fps the farc are for 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.090
 frame and here the preloaded chones that 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.690
 is one of the best things that the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.139
 optimize dynamic updates and 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.770
 he is better 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.930
 we accept 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.330
 and we go here in multiplayer I already 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.500
 I have it added kingdoms cinema books 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.500
 script kingdoms books dotcom 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.469
 and here you have the server but a 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.340
 bit slow good 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.380
 basically because I'm recording in 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.760
 these moments 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.610
 here you see the city home that really 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.439
 only more had he taught her in passing 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.449
 because I did not like very well 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:05.360
 speed that was recorded without the 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.360
 optical and good here there is much to see 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.620
 I'm going to show you how feil there has been 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.070
 with optics and we're going to close this and 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.070
 let out 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.729
 and here we select in the deep profile 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.999
 we select opti fail 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.499
 We give you to save and we give you to play and 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.479
 you are going to see basically what has 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:34.339
 happened with the optimal 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:36.770
 I think it was last night they took out the new 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:39.969
 version about 62 around the world 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.969
 waiting desperately 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.430
 and for sun, basically, the most 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:49.850
 surrealist that you can imagine 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.940
 the whole world full of purple squares 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.900
 and blacks 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.229
 basically as if we were in the 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.599
 world of bitelchÃºs although we change the 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:01.849
 black and white by purple and black 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:05.500
 but good, absolutely everything 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:12.159
 the sky and the clouds the water the fire 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:14.350
 the fountains the gardens the boat with 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.810
 squares 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.160
 really the most surreal in the world 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:25.120
 The statues 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.120
 the water channels absolutely everything 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.069
 in fact until the objects here in the 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.689
 inventory we already have the sewers here 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.639
 of the city 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:38.320
 and even the water from the sewers that here 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:40.720
 they are supposed in average and sewers up to that 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.320
 and this is a 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.840
 endless tunnel 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.860
 it seems that we have taken a triple 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.860
 or something like that 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.830
 and totally awesome by luck 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.629
 they have fixed it very soon 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.000
 they did not load the textures but good 

00:07:55.629 --> 00:08:00.879
 it's fine and everything works perfectly 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.240
 as you have seen and well that is in 

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:06.879
 Just anecdote , you know if you liked it
