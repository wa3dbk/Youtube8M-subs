00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and I'm going to make a loop right

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.189 
and I'm going to make a loop right
around<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.050> finger<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> line<00:00:48.079> then<00:00:49.079> I'm

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
around my finger with that line then I'm

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.149 
around my finger with that line then I'm
going<00:00:49.319> to<00:00:49.379> pull<00:00:49.589> that<00:00:49.620> line<00:00:50.039> off<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:51.089> my<00:00:51.300> finger

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
going to pull that line off on my finger

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.349 
going to pull that line off on my finger
so<00:00:53.159> here<00:00:53.339> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.670> we've<00:00:53.789> got<00:00:53.819> that<00:00:54.120> loop

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
so here you can see we've got that loop

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.200 
so here you can see we've got that loop
now<00:00:57.499> I'm<00:00:58.499> going<00:00:58.679> to<00:00:58.739> pull<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.979> loop<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.550> top

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
now I'm going to pull that loop over top

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.070 
now I'm going to pull that loop over top
of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> point<00:01:01.639> and<00:01:02.639> I'm<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.719> walk<00:01:03.899> that

open that loop up on my finger and take
the<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.220> line<00:01:39.590> come<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.770> through

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the end of that line come back through

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.500 
the end of that line come back through
that<00:01:41.040> loop<00:01:42.980> pull<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.010> nice<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.220> tight<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> now

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
that loop pull it nice and tight so now

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.790 
that loop pull it nice and tight so now
you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.840> I've<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.110> big<00:01:46.320> loop<00:01:46.530> here

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
you can see I've got a big loop here

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.500 
you can see I've got a big loop here
doubled<00:01:47.760> up<00:01:47.850> line<00:01:49.850> got<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.970> safety<00:01:51.180> slide

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
doubled up line got my safety slide

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.810 
doubled up line got my safety slide
right<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.160> bottom<00:01:56.310> side<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.760> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
right here on the bottom side of that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.250 
right here on the bottom side of that
leg<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.480> hole<00:01:57.690> I'm<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:57.990> come<00:01:58.110> up

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
leg that hole I'm going to come up

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.720 
leg that hole I'm going to come up
through<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.740> side<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:01.010> then<00:02:02.010> back<00:02:02.220> down<00:02:02.280> on

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
through one side and then back down on

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.410 
through one side and then back down on
the<00:02:02.850> other<00:02:03.000> side

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.999 

now<00:02:09.420> when<00:02:09.540> I<00:02:09.600> get<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.869> fire<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.920> see

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
now when I get this fire you can see

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
now when I get this fire you can see
I've<00:02:11.130> got<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> loop<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> line<00:02:11.850> right<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
I've got this loop a line right here

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.660 
I've got this loop a line right here
very<00:02:13.020> simple<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.950> walk<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> back<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
very simple now just walk it back to the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.870 
very simple now just walk it back to the
end<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> nock<00:02:15.240> go<00:02:15.450> over<00:02:15.690> top<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.900> nock<00:02:16.880> I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
end of the nock go over top the nock I'm

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.380 
end of the nock go over top the nock I'm
going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> walk<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.170> up

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
going to walk that all the way back up

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.460 
going to walk that all the way back up
over<00:02:21.390> top<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.630> point<00:02:22.460> pull<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.580> tight<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
over top the point pull it tight and you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.770 
over top the point pull it tight and you
can<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.710> I've<00:02:25.800> got<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> nice<00:02:26.250> knot<00:02:26.850> tied<00:02:27.600> right

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
can see I've got a nice knot tied right

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.470 
can see I've got a nice knot tied right
to<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> AMS<00:02:28.350> safety<00:02:28.620> slide<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:30.090> nice<00:02:30.240> part

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
to the AMS safety slide the nice part

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.330 
to the AMS safety slide the nice part
about<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.840> knot<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.070> when<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> get

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
about this knot here is but when I get

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580 
about this knot here is but when I get
the<00:02:32.490> arrow<00:02:32.880> back<00:02:33.120> off<00:02:33.300> my<00:02:33.450> line<00:02:33.660> simply<00:02:34.500> just

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the arrow back off my line simply just

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.500 
the arrow back off my line simply just
going<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> roll<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.100> over<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:35.880> bottom<00:02:36.240> side

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
going to roll it over so my bottom side

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.090 
going to roll it over so my bottom side
of<00:02:36.600> my<00:02:36.660> slide<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.020> up<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:37.980> we've

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
of my slide is up and you can see we've

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
of my slide is up and you can see we've
got<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.460> little<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.930> little<00:02:39.930> loop<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.560> here

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
got that little a little loop right here

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
got that little a little loop right here
started<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> pull<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.330> line<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
started I'm going to pull that line and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
started I'm going to pull that line and
I<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.190> find<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> line<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.820> closest

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
I want to find the line that's closest

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.300 
I want to find the line that's closest
to<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> point<00:02:45.750> right<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> grab<00:02:47.280> that

to the point right here so I grab that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.150 
to the point right here so I grab that
line<00:02:48.290> walk<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> down<00:02:49.850> over<00:02:50.850> top<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> point

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
line walk it down over top the point

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.330 
line walk it down over top the point
walk<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.310> back<00:02:53.490> down<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.080> knock<00:02:55.080> over<00:02:55.920> top
