00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello again all friends 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
 I am paper and then welcome to my channel 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.970
 from youtube and in this video what I 'm going 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 to teach is a lapel cover for the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.360
 samsung galaxy great prime a sleeve that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 for me it has a special value and 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.400
 while I do in boxing I will explain 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.850
 why 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.640
 and well here we have the article because 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.250
 I have opted to do the unboxing of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.870
 a cover so normal and so ordinary 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.739
 Well for a simple reason very clear 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.680
 why go the work that has cost me 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.410
 find her 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.140
 As you know I recently acquired the samsung 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.600
 galaxy great first state looking 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 protective cases with the particularity 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.290
 that they told me why you 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.750
 fruits that we have with tapas only 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.510
 is the book type and I cover them with 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.650
 book type covers is that the truth is not 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.570
 I like it 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.729
 nowadays as a human today not 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.340
 as it has always been said for likes 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.960
 colors I know that that type of cover 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 there are some that are very good because 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.050
 they have a transparent window that makes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.880
 that by pressing the sleep button without 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.250
 need to open it you can see the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.050
 hour because the truth is that I know 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.930
 a lot of people since since 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.960
 has the mobile phone because it does not carry the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.680
 watch but uses the watch 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.890
 and me the cover that I like the covers 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.380
 of lapel I like those that open from 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.240
 up and down and the lapel stays 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.759
 hanging for change then what I do 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 is that he folded himself from behind and I put 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.610
 and I start talking to her because look 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.330
 what sought looks what sought and when what 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.680
 I've lost in a small shop 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.509
 these that are put in the centers 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.550
 commercials but they do not block us the yes 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.220
 but in the concourses of the centers 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.330
 commercial put a small kiosquito 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.450
 a man who sells accessories 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.370
 mobile phone 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.050
 a shopping center near the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.379
 locality of fuengirola where I live 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.540
 Well yes sir, I had one of this 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.129
 color in black and another in pink 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.800
 migoya for black because nothing I'm going to 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.209
 proceed to the boxing look so that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.209
 see and we go 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.750
 the cover has left me for 18 euros is 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.210
 the sayo mark of this classic of these 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 normal 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.840
 Y 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.849
 is 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.540
 at least it is packaged so 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.900
 put here 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.000
 calleja was cobo alley that I think is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.890
 the industrial estate 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.390
 Fuenlabrada here is what it puts in a 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.310
 label but I guess there will be 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.310
 imported and they will have started it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 the cover because despite being so bad 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 we tie and audi I do not like anything more than 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.990
 eight euros has been more what I spent 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.940
 in spinning when the other thing 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.200
 is very well finished has a 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.710
 small a small sticker here that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.700
 it gives a small touch of color and good 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.700
 let's open it 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.620
 you have protection here so that you do not 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.920
 crumple the packaging is a packaging 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.810
 a transparent plastic and it's where 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.269
 is specified that belongs to the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.599
 samsung galaxy great first this yes 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.189
 I day in a cardboard blister that has been 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.150
 stayed the gentleman of the store so that 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.549
 will serve you for another power 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.430
 well let's put them let's remove 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.250
 these covers of these normalistas that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.700
 I had caught 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.690
 in a Chinese to protect me the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.530
 rear 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.530
 let's remove it 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.209
 and let's put it 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.690
 obviously fits perfectly 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.690
 that I wanted to make this video 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.100
 because I already tell you for the joy that I have 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.680
 had and the adjustments have found it 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.460
 because to me these are the covers of 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.460
 tapas that I like 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.920
 paint 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.080
 If I want to curl the loop, I like it 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.540
 that what is the grip to catch it 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 to be here that is down here that 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.220
 be that is on the top that 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.690
 be at the bottom because some 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.280
 times when you put your ear in the 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.990
 headset because this bothers you a little 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.930
 but good with time is talking about 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.729
 if it goes doubled it is already 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.840
 and what I do is that when I receive a 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.840
 call so she 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.460
 and he put it on his ear and talk 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.810
 these are the covers that I like 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:23.340
 these are the favorites I do not like anymore 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.340
 I say I do not like art type books 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.990
 good finish then to be what it is and 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.600
 to be worth what you're worth, you can see that 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.600
 Cooked is not stuck 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.599
 fits perfectly everything that they are 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.189
 for the camera for the speaker for 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.340
 Flar then everything goes perfect because 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.620
 first the cover that corresponded 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.630
 a small gap in your entrance 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.790
 headphones things that I do not care 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.510
 because I always use the atria of 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:06:00.020
 bluetooth type and it's less bad that 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:03.110
 we found an open cover of normal 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.380
 well this has been all in this little 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.140
 video thank you very much for having 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.600
 I had the difference of having them 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.710
 seen if you liked it I would like very much 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.800
 to support me and with a like and nothing like 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.660
 I always say hello to all care 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.660
