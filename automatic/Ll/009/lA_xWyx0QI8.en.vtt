00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.399 
also receive your VGA the DVI adapter
and<00:02:57.930> here<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:58.950> is<00:03:00.650> gtx<00:03:02.360> 570<00:03:03.360> graphics<00:03:03.870> card<00:03:04.140> so

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
and here it is gtx 570 graphics card so

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.960 
and here it is gtx 570 graphics card so
let's<00:03:04.739> take<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.010> card<00:03:05.280> out<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.700> wrapper

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
let's take this card out of the wrapper

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.030 
let's take this card out of the wrapper
and<00:03:06.299> check<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.900> some<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.440> features<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and check out some of the features of

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:23.539 
and check out some of the features of
this<00:03:08.340> graphics<00:03:08.849> card<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.739> here<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.010> first

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
this graphics card and here it is first

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.349 
this graphics card and here it is first
look<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.000> EVGA<00:03:24.359> gtx<00:03:25.700> 570<00:03:26.730> let's<00:03:27.090> get<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
look at the EVGA gtx 570 let's get the

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.819 
look at the EVGA gtx 570 let's get the
wrapper<00:03:27.569> off<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.260> card<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.329> are<00:03:30.829> on

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
wrapper off this card and here we are on

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.470 
wrapper off this card and here we are on
the<00:03:32.069> back<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.430> graphics<00:03:32.849> card<00:03:32.940> we<00:03:33.299> have

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the back of the graphics card we have

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.809 
the back of the graphics card we have
this<00:03:33.599> large<00:03:33.900> vent<00:03:34.260> for<00:03:34.650> vent<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.400> heat<00:03:35.579> out

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
this large vent for vent in the heat out

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.000 
this large vent for vent in the heat out
of<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:36.209> graphics<00:03:36.629> card<00:03:36.720> now<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.530> graphics

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
of this graphics card now this graphics

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.610 
of this graphics card now this graphics
card<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.459> an<00:03:38.579> external<00:03:39.299> exhaust<00:03:40.109> cooling

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
card is an external exhaust cooling

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.500 
card is an external exhaust cooling
solution<00:03:41.129> which<00:03:41.519> means<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.909> sucks<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> cool

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
solution which means it sucks the cool

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.140 
solution which means it sucks the cool
air<00:03:42.720> from<00:03:42.840> inside<00:03:42.989> your<00:03:43.470> PC<00:03:43.709> flows<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.910> across

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
air from inside your PC flows it across

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.940 
air from inside your PC flows it across
