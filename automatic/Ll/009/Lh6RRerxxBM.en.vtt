dr.<00:00:39.030> moon<00:00:39.180> video<00:00:39.780> game<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.200> you've<00:00:40.350> played

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
dr. moon video game if you've played

that<00:00:40.590> wall<00:00:41.040> passwords<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.420> think

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that wall passwords on it and I think

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.850 
that wall passwords on it and I think
he's<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.140> tank<00:00:43.440> mode<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
he's got the same tank mode and the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.850 
he's got the same tank mode and the
robot<00:00:44.160> mode<00:00:44.280> looks<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:44.940> similar<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
robot mode looks very very similar so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
robot mode looks very very similar so
hopefully<00:00:46.860> we'll<00:00:46.980> see<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> repaint<00:00:47.489> soon<00:00:47.730> maybe

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I think this tank in real life doesn't

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
I think this tank in real life doesn't
have<00:01:31.409> anything<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> top<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> is

have anything on the top I think this is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.340 
have anything on the top I think this is
just<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.930> real<00:01:33.960> life

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
just how it is in real life

them what their main body is and that's
about<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> turret<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.729> gray<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.720> there

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
about it in the turret is gray so there

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
about it in the turret is gray so there
we<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.860> vehicle<00:02:11.129> mode<00:02:11.310> let's<00:02:11.970> get<00:02:12.090> in

transformed
to<00:02:13.530> his<00:02:13.620> robot<00:02:13.920> mode<00:02:14.400> okay<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:15.540> girls

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
to his robot mode okay now girls

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.960 
to his robot mode okay now girls
transformation<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.770> fairly<00:02:17.160> easy<00:02:17.280> well<00:02:17.820> I'm

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
transformation is fairly easy well I'm

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.310 
transformation is fairly easy well I'm
probably<00:02:18.300> going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> make<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.870> look<00:02:19.020> hard

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
probably going to make it look hard

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.700 
probably going to make it look hard
because<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.830> joints<00:02:20.190> online<00:02:20.520> are<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.030> tight<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
because the joints online are so tight I

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.240 
because the joints online are so tight I
mean<00:02:23.040> his<00:02:23.400> legs<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.910> barely<00:02:24.450> move<00:02:25.250> just

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
mean his legs can barely move just

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.770 
mean his legs can barely move just
because<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.060> ball<00:02:27.210> joint<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.630> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
because of this the ball joint is so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
because of this the ball joint is so
tight

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
tight

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.740

the<00:02:37.530> legs<00:02:37.710> rotate<00:02:38.640> them<00:02:38.910> down<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.680> kind<00:02:40.680> of

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
the legs rotate them down and kind of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.130 
the legs rotate them down and kind of
get<00:02:40.950> them<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.120> where<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:42.960> also

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
get them out this is where it's also

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.250 
get them out this is where it's also
really<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:43.920> stiff<00:02:44.190> online<00:02:44.630> take<00:02:45.630> ages<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
really really stiff online take ages to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.120 
really really stiff online take ages to
kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> flip<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:49.130> because

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
kind of flip this around because

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650 
kind of flip this around because
everything<00:02:50.580> pegs<00:02:50.850> together<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.540> really

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
everything pegs together really really

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.380 
everything pegs together really really
tightly<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.940> does<00:02:54.150> make<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
tightly so that does make the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.420 
tightly so that does make the
transformation<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.960> little<00:02:55.170> bit<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
transformation a little bit kind of

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.150 
transformation a little bit kind of
frustrating<00:02:56.970> at<00:02:57.060> times<00:02:57.890> once<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.980> get

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
frustrating at times once you get

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.950 
frustrating at times once you get
everything<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.730> peg<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.330> it's<00:03:00.450> fine<00:03:00.660> I'm

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
everything on peg then it's fine I'm

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.140 
everything on peg then it's fine I'm
just<00:03:01.170> gonna<00:03:01.260> rotate<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.620> around<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> feet

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
just gonna rotate it around the feet

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.100 
just gonna rotate it around the feet
like<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.740> we're<00:03:04.740> gonna<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:05.180> rotate<00:03:06.180> out<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
like that we're gonna do rotate out the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.760 
like that we're gonna do rotate out the
arms<00:03:07.550> rotate<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> legs<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.450> get<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> arms

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
arms rotate on the legs and get the arms

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.280 
arms rotate on the legs and get the arms
fold<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.180> these<00:03:15.180> pieces<00:03:15.450> kind

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
fold it down like so these pieces kind

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.930 
fold it down like so these pieces kind
of<00:03:16.410> annoy<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.860> because<00:03:17.190> sometimes<00:03:17.670> they<00:03:17.820> go

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
of annoy me because sometimes they go

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.160 
of annoy me because sometimes they go
like<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.270> sometimes<00:03:18.600> they<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:18.990> don't

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
like that and sometimes they just don't

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.330 
like that and sometimes they just don't
stay<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:21.600> too<00:03:21.780> bad<00:03:21.990> anyway<00:03:22.740> get<00:03:23.190> him

this<00:04:29.670> guy<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:31.470> terms<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.860> his<00:04:31.950> articulation<00:04:32.360> he

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
this guy in terms of his articulation he

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.480 
this guy in terms of his articulation he
has<00:04:33.480> got<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> ball<00:04:33.900> joint<00:04:34.140> up<00:04:34.350> here<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
has got a ball joint up here but the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.280 
has got a ball joint up here but the
joints<00:04:35.790> are<00:04:35.880> really<00:04:36.150> tight<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.450> mine<00:04:36.630> so<00:04:36.870> I

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
joints are really tight on mine so I

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.900 
joints are really tight on mine so I
don't<00:04:37.440> want<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> break<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.980> I<00:04:38.220> mean<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:38.850> don't

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
don't want to break it I mean I don't

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.930 
don't want to break it I mean I don't
really<00:04:39.090> want<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:40.340> pull<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> ball<00:04:41.610> joint<00:04:41.820> out

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
really want to pull the ball joint out

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.730 
really want to pull the ball joint out
because<00:04:42.300> um<00:04:42.510> it'll<00:04:43.020> take<00:04:43.170> ages<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.500> get<00:04:43.590> back

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
because um it'll take ages to get back

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.610 
because um it'll take ages to get back
in<00:04:43.860> yes<00:04:44.700> got<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.910> joint<00:04:45.180> here<00:04:45.510> ball<00:04:45.990> jointed<00:04:46.410> at

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
in yes got a joint here ball jointed at

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.480 
in yes got a joint here ball jointed at
the<00:04:47.360> elbow<00:04:48.360> no<00:04:49.290> waist<00:04:49.530> articulation<00:04:49.650> he's<00:04:50.340> got

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
the elbow no waist articulation he's got

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.250 
the elbow no waist articulation he's got
a<00:04:50.520> ball<00:04:50.730> joint<00:04:50.880> here<00:04:51.210> can<00:04:51.450> bend<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.900> knee

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
a ball joint here can bend at the knee

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.740 
a ball joint here can bend at the knee
and<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.590> feet<00:04:53.250> do<00:04:53.610> pivots<00:04:54.060> due<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
and the feet do pivots due to the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.810 
and the feet do pivots due to the
transformation<00:04:55.200> so<00:04:55.620> he<00:04:55.710> does<00:04:55.830> have<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:56.040> few

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
transformation so he does have a few

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.910 
transformation so he does have a few
points<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.180> articulation<00:04:57.410> but<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.680> said

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
points of articulation but like I said

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.250 
points of articulation but like I said
because<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.550> joints<00:04:59.850> been<00:04:59.970> so<00:05:00.180> tight<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:01.080> can

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
because the joints been so tight you can

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.340 
because the joints been so tight you can
barely<00:05:01.500> get<00:05:01.770> him<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:03.240> move<00:05:03.450> properly<00:05:03.900> well

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
barely get him to move properly well

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.670 
barely get him to move properly well
there<00:05:04.770> we<00:05:04.860> go<00:05:04.980> just<00:05:05.930> for<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.020> quick<00:05:07.410> size

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
there we go just for a quick size

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.970 
there we go just for a quick size
comparison<00:05:07.710> Harry's<00:05:08.610> next<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.910> power<00:05:09.120> glide

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
comparison Harry's next to power glide

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.310 
comparison Harry's next to power glide
so<00:05:10.980> you<00:05:11.070> can<00:05:11.220> see<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.730> ghazal<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.420> very<00:05:13.020> wide

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
so you can see that ghazal is very wide

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.000 
so you can see that ghazal is very wide
it's<00:05:13.620> very<00:05:13.800> broad<00:05:14.040> where<00:05:15.530> power<00:05:16.530> glide<00:05:16.710> here

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
it's very broad where power glide here

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.320 
it's very broad where power glide here
is<00:05:17.130> just<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.430> little<00:05:17.640> bit<00:05:17.730> here<00:05:17.880> he's<00:05:18.120> kind<00:05:18.240> of

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
is just a little bit here he's kind of

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.120 
is just a little bit here he's kind of
small<00:05:18.420> this<00:05:19.200> one's<00:05:19.380> very<00:05:19.440> wide<00:05:19.800> it's<00:05:19.980> not

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
small this one's very wide it's not

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.980 
small this one's very wide it's not
exactly<00:05:20.400> tall<00:05:20.730> but<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.180> gun<00:05:21.390> does<00:05:21.660> make<00:05:21.840> him<00:05:21.930> a

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
exactly tall but the gun does make him a

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.040 
exactly tall but the gun does make him a
little<00:05:22.140> bit<00:05:22.200> taller<00:05:22.380> but<00:05:22.650> yeah<00:05:23.370> there<00:05:23.640> we<00:05:23.700> go

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
little bit taller but yeah there we go

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.930 
little bit taller but yeah there we go
overall<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.350> think<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.950> ghazal<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:26.730> an

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
overall I think that ghazal is an

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.700 
overall I think that ghazal is an
amazing<00:05:27.450> figure<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.080> really<00:05:28.530> highly
