00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.480
 hello people there is a new episode 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.820
 clash of plants today with five things 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.570
 formerly differently when did with it 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.330
 I fled 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.550
 choosy as amos about facts 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.460
 picked out I would say let's go 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.160
 so now get to the first effect and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.760
 Although on 10 january 2013 came the dark 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.320
 elixir in clash of plants and thus came 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.750
 even then the heroes to that is called the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.220
 Queen and the king her plan on 10 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.559
 January 2013 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.239
 yes, exactly the heroes who had the following 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.890
 earlier they had a range that was 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.330
 not classified in should be as radios as it is 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.699
 Today is but they were easy 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.049
 always unlock bar that means if you have one 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.269
 troop has sat down on the edge 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.650
 both heroes have registered and 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.930
 now it's gone like that 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.909
 if you lure the clear troops out yes 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.710
 and the crass it just so has the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.210
 Dynamics of attacks completely changed 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.879
 now it is really heroes stay 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.610
 always in the middle are not quite there for that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.510
 so strong is that she is her 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.229
 want to have done bad they were 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.210
 worsened with the update then and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.460
 yes, just what you do 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.230
 Heroes could lure from everywhere and so on 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.180
 Brendel corner could lure and there 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.130
 then get them destroyed there 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.470
 So we come to fact 2 and what 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.060
 earlier so you really always fall 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.070
 every time you had to buy 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.950
 was attacked knew in the shop 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.840
 you had to go to defense 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.240
 and then falling again buy 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.980
 want for 6000 for the skeleton parts 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 or rather good that was there at that time 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:43.000
 not for 4000 or similar it was 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.159
 early fall quite time consuming to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 say we use and super his 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.840
 that's a bit of the game 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.990
 It develops a bit 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.550
 realized and that I thought well then 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.930
 he prefers to do it that way 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.479
 can reactivate again '2013 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.159
 end of 2013 or mid-2014 is also 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.210
 still come that you drop the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.650
 can reactivate all over the city hall and 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.780
 that's just how much it is 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.659
 easier and somehow a little better 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.299
 right yes fact 03 who once the 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.769
 bensberger if he often sees with her 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.209
 have the researcher mode we have once 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.549
 On it a war base you can do three 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.140
 build it differently and all that 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.700
 quite cleverly make that happy 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.890
 it will not be on the screenshot 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.989
 have logged in there is simply this 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 button not we knew everything then 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.080
 collect by hand but everything from 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.239
 hand shift 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.980
 it was all that time was so because 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.209
 right and we had everything 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.500
 we could not delete anything 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.810
 not at all we have to do everything individually 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.769
 should push the corner and the walls 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.420
 that could not in series 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.160
 click but also everything individual 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.170
 it was right time open then me 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 it was just damn right 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.610
 time consuming simply a new layout 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.739
 new base easy to build that was the case 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.650
 blatantly and that's why you have that 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.709
 maybe two three times a town hall 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.670
 level is done and that's how you feel 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.500
 not really that much 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.420
 taken care of there I was there speed picture 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.470
 actually almost no topic because 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.660
 Just everyone once a base 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.680
 has searched and then seen for 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.269
 always keep it then white 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 really was so damn consuming 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.410
 so we agreed to fact number 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.190
 four, and this time it's about the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.989
 barracks 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.519
 it has always been that way it always the 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.260
 Ten levels were there, it did not matter 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.060
 but if you change now 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.630
 train troops clicks you see this 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.220
 screensaver 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.079
 it used to be so here no arrows 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.910
 There are a few big ones around here 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.760
 nothing had since trained next 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.470
 Chancellor search had to click on it were 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.090
 had to train like the colorful and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.549
 again clicked on click because it 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.690
 was pretty annoying and developer too 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.660
 had noticed a little bit this 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.000
 great buttons then introduced 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.650
 save some time and you okay 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.139
 In fact, we would already be five 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.400
 when the last fact arrived it's about 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.290
 the league was in the lead the league 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.790
 introduced 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.319
 before that, the whole thing was not there 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.769
 no league that means there was no one 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.260
 bonus 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.609
 It was only the level indicators on 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.350
 shown who comparable here now 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.790
 looks opel looks like and then with 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.540
 the level display that besides beside the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.400
 names 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.739
 You can also add that it works 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.480
 Not such a system really existed 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.069
 the best players were listed 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.109
 it was not sorted by level either 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.479
 now sorted by league but there was 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.120
 just this button was not exactly there 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.250
 Although the best clans but not the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.020
 best player sorted or there was stop 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.200
 already the one as sorted by 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.330
 this trophy number right here 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.190
 I have always believed that it has always existed 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.900
 also different then the system i know 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.090
 but not exactly that of the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.050
 follow five things in clash of shines the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.909
 formerly different 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.560
 follow are a little short these are 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.280
 Guilty first, there are also 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.080
 some more 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.759
 he is always a little bit too 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.650
 has picked out a few facts 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.330
 has searched screenshots is then 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.919
 quite a lot of work on the load 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.870
 definitely see lighter then 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.150
 every case either when flo or at 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.919
 the tournament flew by 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.110
 and stop by me also harms 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.110
 not we want to ring it up then
