00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
packing one of the things that we found

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
packing one of the things that we found
quite<00:00:23.609> interesting<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> sportsman<00:00:25.019> show

quite interesting at the sportsman show
this<00:00:25.410> last<00:00:25.650> year<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.490> awful<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
this last year was there an awful lot of

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.439 
this last year was there an awful lot of
people<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> wanted<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.769> things<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.609> bags

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
people that wanted to can things in bags

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
people that wanted to can things in bags
because<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.019> didn't<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.619> glass

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
because they didn't want to use glass

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.000 
because they didn't want to use glass
jars<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.600> break<00:00:33.780> cans<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.770> getting

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
jars because they break cans are getting

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
jars because they break cans are getting
fairly<00:00:35.280> expensive<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.120> they're<00:00:36.210> hard<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> put

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
fairly expensive and they're hard to put

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.100 
fairly expensive and they're hard to put
a<00:00:37.170> seal<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.739> without<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.190> specialized<00:00:38.790> machine

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
a seal on without a specialized machine

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.979 
a seal on without a specialized machine
so<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.379> vacuum<00:00:40.890> packer<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.610> double<00:00:42.329> itself<00:00:42.690> as

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so a vacuum packer can double itself as

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.190 
so a vacuum packer can double itself as
a<00:00:43.559> canning<00:00:44.550> accessory<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a canning accessory if you have the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.369 
a canning accessory if you have the
right<00:00:46.350> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> bag<00:00:47.120> now<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> bags<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.260> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
right kind of bag now the bags that we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.670 
right kind of bag now the bags that we
use<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.390> are<00:00:51.390> what's<00:00:51.840> called<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.260> retort

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
use for that are what's called a retort

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910 
use for that are what's called a retort
pouch<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:54.449> are<00:00:54.780> incredibly<00:00:55.620> thick

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pouch and these are incredibly thick

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.959 
pouch and these are incredibly thick
very<00:00:56.399> strong<00:00:57.199> basically<00:00:58.199> flexible<00:00:59.010> cane<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
very strong basically flexible cane so

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.319 
very strong basically flexible cane so
they<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.840> harder<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> seal

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
they are a little bit harder to seal

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.759 
they are a little bit harder to seal
they<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> tear<00:01:03.870> notch<00:01:04.080> down<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
they have a tear notch down at the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
they have a tear notch down at the
bottom<00:01:04.949> end<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.450> seal

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
bottom end of them and so you seal

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
bottom end of them and so you seal
across<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> bottom<00:01:07.740> into<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.130> bag<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> what

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
across the bottom into this bag and what

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
across the bottom into this bag and what
you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.810> basically<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.590> use<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.070> bag<00:01:11.400> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you can do basically is use this bag for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.859 
you can do basically is use this bag for
canning

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
canning

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
canning
so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> pressure<00:01:14.100> canner<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so you have to use a pressure canner and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
so you have to use a pressure canner and
you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.080> follow<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.650> same

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
a specialized heat bar so the way that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
a specialized heat bar so the way that
you<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> retort<00:01:29.189> bag<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> type

you would use a retort bag in this type
of<00:01:30.299> machine<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:31.500> take<00:01:31.530> either<00:01:32.270> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
of machine is you would take either if

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.960 
of machine is you would take either if
you<00:01:33.390> wanted<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:33.930> canned<00:01:34.229> salmon<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.670> would

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
settings a little bit differently than

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
settings a little bit differently than
we<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.989> original<00:02:10.470> settings

one<00:02:13.570> up<00:02:13.870> two<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:19.300> p8<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.080> had<00:02:20.350> set<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
one up two was p8 that I had set up so

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.370 
one up two was p8 that I had set up so
let's<00:02:21.640> check<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> settings<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.570> p8<00:02:23.020> we're

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
let's check the settings on p8 we're

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.730 
let's check the settings on p8 we're
gonna<00:02:23.530> pull<00:02:23.770> out<00:02:23.820> 99.9%<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> air<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.470> in

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
gonna pull out 99.9% of the air and in

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.740 
gonna pull out 99.9% of the air and in
this<00:02:26.920> case<00:02:27.220> we're<00:02:27.490> gonna<00:02:27.610> run<00:02:27.880> an<00:02:28.030> extended

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this case we're gonna run an extended

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.710 
this case we're gonna run an extended
vacuum<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.800> about<00:02:30.190> 10<00:02:30.520> seconds<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.570> make

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
vacuum for about 10 seconds just to make

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.350 
vacuum for about 10 seconds just to make
sure<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:32.200> get<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.590> complete<00:02:33.130> evacuation<00:02:33.400> inside

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
sure we get a complete evacuation inside

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.030 
sure we get a complete evacuation inside
the<00:02:34.540> bag<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.620> guess<00:02:38.740> we're<00:02:38.890> going<00:02:38.980> to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the bag and well I guess we're going to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.810 
the bag and well I guess we're going to
run<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.400> 11<00:02:39.670> seconds<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.120> time<00:02:41.820> we're

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
run it for 11 seconds this time we're

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.730 
run it for 11 seconds this time we're
not<00:02:42.850> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.240> put<00:02:43.420> any<00:02:43.540> gas<00:02:43.780> flush<00:02:44.140> back<00:02:44.380> into

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
not going to put any gas flush back into

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.770 
not going to put any gas flush back into
this<00:02:44.860> bag<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.520> we're<00:02:45.700> gonna<00:02:45.880> run<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
this bag and we're gonna run because the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.050 
this bag and we're gonna run because the
retort<00:02:47.230> pouches<00:02:47.560> are<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.310> much<00:02:48.520> thicker<00:02:48.910> and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
retort pouches are so much thicker and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.030 
retort pouches are so much thicker and
stronger<00:02:49.570> we're<00:02:50.440> going<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.710> run<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
stronger we're going to run the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.370 
stronger we're going to run the
heat-seal<00:02:51.550> cycle<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.650> 2.4<00:02:53.650> seconds<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.459> time

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
heat-seal cycle at 2.4 seconds this time

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.920 
heat-seal cycle at 2.4 seconds this time
so<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:56.530> back<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.740> p8<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.420> now<00:02:58.660> we're<00:02:58.840> going

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
so we're back to p8 and now we're going

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.640 
so we're back to p8 and now we're going
to<00:02:59.050> run<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.500> heat<00:02:59.830> cycle<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:02.410> see<00:03:02.590> you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
to run that heat cycle I don't see you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.460 
to run that heat cycle I don't see you
push<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.040> green<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:03.490> for<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:04.020> now<00:03:05.020> it'll<00:03:05.290> be

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
push the green one for go now it'll be

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.140 
push the green one for go now it'll be
important<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.980> watch<00:03:06.160> what<00:03:06.430> happens<00:03:06.910> when

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
important to watch what happens when

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.699 
important to watch what happens when
this<00:03:07.360> cycle<00:03:07.810> gets<00:03:07.990> up<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.490> 99.9%<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.120> year

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
this cycle gets up to 99.9% of the year

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.500 
this cycle gets up to 99.9% of the year
because<00:03:11.709> after<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.310> hits<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.670> 99.9<00:03:13.660> percent

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.140 

we're<00:03:18.019> gonna<00:03:18.170> run<00:03:18.440> an<00:03:18.560> extended<00:03:19.190> vacuum<00:03:19.700> so

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
we're gonna run an extended vacuum so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.259 
we're gonna run an extended vacuum so
that<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:21.099> pump<00:03:22.099> is<00:03:22.250> going<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.580> continue<00:03:23.120> to

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
that the pump is going to continue to

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.229 
that the pump is going to continue to
run<00:03:23.510> for<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.019> little<00:03:24.230> bit<00:03:24.590> longer<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.430> now<00:03:26.060> it's

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
run for a little bit longer and now it's

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.660 
run for a little bit longer and now it's
going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.599> start<00:03:26.840> counting<00:03:27.049> back<00:03:27.500> down<00:03:27.860> at<00:03:28.370> ten

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to start counting back down at ten

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.229 
going to start counting back down at ten
seconds<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.480> had<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:29.840> cycle<00:03:30.230> set<00:03:30.440> for

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
seconds that we had the cycle set for

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.979 
seconds that we had the cycle set for
soon<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.540> 10<00:03:32.780> seconds<00:03:33.200> hits<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.780> heat

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
soon is that 10 seconds hits the heat

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.720 
soon is that 10 seconds hits the heat
cycle<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.590> going<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.099> heat-seal<00:03:37.459> barge

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730

jumps up seals the bag for 2.4 seconds

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.880 
jumps up seals the bag for 2.4 seconds
and<00:03:43.480> because<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.690> have<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> specialized<00:03:45.590> heat

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and because we have a specialized heat

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.009 
and because we have a specialized heat
seal<00:03:46.129> bar<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.610> here<00:03:46.849> we<00:03:47.060> can<00:03:47.239> actually<00:03:47.480> crimp

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
seal bar in here we can actually crimp

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.199 
seal bar in here we can actually crimp
that<00:03:48.230> bag<00:03:48.440> shut<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.069> get<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> good<00:03:49.549> solid<00:03:49.819> seal

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
that bag shut and get a good solid seal

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.400 
that bag shut and get a good solid seal
even<00:03:50.540> on<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> retort<00:03:51.290> bag<00:03:52.720> now<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.989> is<00:03:54.170> ready

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410
