00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and you've actually got a demonstration

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
and you've actually got a demonstration
side<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.320> actually<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.979> do

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
side here where we can actually see do

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
side here where we can actually see do
our<00:01:05.610> process<00:01:06.210> involved<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.740> goes<00:01:07.920> into

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
our process involved in what goes into

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
our process involved in what goes into
making<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.670> knife<00:01:08.880> yes<00:01:09.950> making<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> good

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
making a good knife yes making a good

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.810 
making a good knife yes making a good
knife<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.390> materials<00:01:13.820> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
knife you need very good materials you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.789 
knife you need very good materials you
need<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.270> hard<00:01:15.509> steel<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.350> putting<00:01:16.710> an

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
need a very hard steel for putting an

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640 
need a very hard steel for putting an
edge<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> carbon<00:01:18.299> steel<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.229> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
edge on this is a carbon steel it is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.390 
edge on this is a carbon steel it is
super<00:01:20.549> hard<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> brittle<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> if

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
super hard but it's like a brittle so if

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
super hard but it's like a brittle so if
you<00:01:23.520> combine<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.360> wrought<00:01:24.720> iron<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you combine it with the wrought iron the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.760 
you combine it with the wrought iron the
wrought<00:01:26.130> iron<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.610> add<00:01:26.850> strength<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
wrought iron will add strength to it and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.630 
wrought iron will add strength to it and
the<00:01:28.770> knife<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> lot<00:01:29.610> easier

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the knife is actually a lot easier

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
the knife is actually a lot easier
forging<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> forming<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> sharpening<00:01:32.040> if

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
forging and forming and sharpening if

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.359 
forging and forming and sharpening if
you<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:35.040> happens

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you have it like this so what happens

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
you have it like this so what happens
here<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> zoom<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
here is if you want to do a zoom up on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.749 
here is if you want to do a zoom up on
this<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.619> few<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> steps<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.729> go

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this so the few of the steps that go

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.730 
this so the few of the steps that go
through<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> process<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.079> steps<00:01:43.500> here

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
through the process the first steps here

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.179 
through the process the first steps here
are<00:01:43.770> by<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> blade<00:01:44.880> Smith<00:01:45.710> takes<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.829> 10

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
are by the blade Smith takes about 10

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.960 
are by the blade Smith takes about 10
years<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.700> learn<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> basics<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.840> making<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
years to learn the basics of making this

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.789 
years to learn the basics of making this
hammering<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:52.079> three<00:01:52.590> times

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hammering it out to about three times

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.310 
hammering it out to about three times
the<00:01:52.950> length<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> three<00:01:53.610> times<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> width

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the length and three times the width

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
the length and three times the width
giving<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> basic<00:01:55.890> shape<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.090> they

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
giving it the basic shape and then they

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.679 
giving it the basic shape and then they
do<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.780> tempering<00:01:58.740> hardening<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> tempering

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
do the tempering hardening and tempering

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
do the tempering hardening and tempering
from<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> next<00:02:01.829> craftsman<00:02:02.340> who

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
from here on it's the next craftsman who

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.120 
from here on it's the next craftsman who
will<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.659> grinding<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> sharpening

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
will then do the grinding and sharpening

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.150 
will then do the grinding and sharpening
here<00:02:05.969> you've<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.299> another<00:02:06.540> nine<00:02:07.110> eight<00:02:07.560> steps

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
here you've got another nine eight steps
