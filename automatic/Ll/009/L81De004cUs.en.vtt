00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
 i 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.610
 welcome I am thin stripe frames for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 draw well dotcom this is the challenge 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.030
 52 a drawing a week for a whole 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.850
 year 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.340
 we are in the fourth week and this is the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.400
 fourth street fighter character in 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.310
 this occasion plays vega the already classic 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.650
 spanish fighter fast as lightning and 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.080
 lethal with his claw and chopped attacks 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.080
 after several sketches that I did not 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.600
 just like it end up opting for a 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.480
 composition in which they appeared vega and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.700
 eternal chun-li rivals in this 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.190
 videogame but I did not finish 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.760
 convince since vega had very little 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.090
 prominence and this was his week well 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.670
 well discarded 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 As a next option I have opted for a 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.250
 pose much more calm but threatening 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.229
 showing claws a bust that I thought that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.750
 the sea would be good but sometimes 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.229
 ideas do not quite materialize well in the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.420
 paper and this has been the case after a 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.910
 I gave him time to decide I was not the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.260
 drawing I wanted for this challenge so 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.260
 that was 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.580
 as a cartoonist you have to learn to erase 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.940
 or leave a drawing behind and start another 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.159
 it's an unpleasant task I do not know how to see 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.080
 they leave minutes and hours behind a 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.020
 rubber run or with a new canvas 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.050
 replacing the previous one but it's a 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.050
 experience that we all have at some time 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:46.229
 also looking at it on the positive side 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.229
 so you draw more and learn more 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.020
 after deciding to eliminate the bust and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.360
 restart again I have raised the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 possibility of rescuing the pose in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.010
 chopped from the first option the one that looks 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 in the video but this time leaving friend 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.750
 alone and making it the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.120
 the spectator who imagines who is the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 lucky or lucky you will see 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.119
 surprised by this fleeting attack the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.119
 Spanish character 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.300
 regarding the drawings of the challenge 52 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.030
 this month is the street theme 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.490
 fighter because so much character of 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.610
 popular video game you ask yourself good 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.560
 are several reasons is a very product 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.140
 popular and well-known we have all played 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.510
 they are very characters 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.320
 stereotyped and relatively simple 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.540
 to start the challenge 52 go great 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.580
 in this case the stereotype of vega is 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.250
 something peculiar meets the bullfighter's 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.460
 typical is a weapons master like 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.140
 indicates his red handkerchief and good the rest 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.800
 of the mask and so on is fantasy 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.800
 japanese 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.730
 but this month ends next month 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.730
 now theme new promised 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.079
 talking a little about the illustration in 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.750
 this case carried more land 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.090
 pictorial I have depended less on the line 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.900
 than in the other two previous drawings 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.209
 the river versus saga and the road in 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.210
 this case the stage do with a kind of 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.640
 paint simulation to order 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.910
 as I always say it's good to have a 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.530
 control over light on anatomy and 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.450
 perspective is a must 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.430
 this year I want to take care of this topic 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.920
 and be able to help you so that your drawings 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.200
 be better and better 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.780
 for next week there's no 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.910
 voting I have taken the liberty as 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.640
 organizer of the event in making a 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.010
 proposal fixed this time the last 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.970
 street fighter character to close 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.239
 January but beware that you invent that is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.310
 this time depends on your imagination to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.130
 personal title this is a great 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.709
 moment to demonstrate your creativity and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.110
 Test your skills design your 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.330
 character but keep in mind that you should 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.650
 to be able to work in the videogame of 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.959
 capcom that you do not leave the pot 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.299
 if you think that inventing a character is 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.879
 too much for you you can choose your 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.259
 favorite character and redesign your 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.259
 wardrobe or appearance 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.580
 and without more I leave you so that you enjoy the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.710
 rest of the video if you liked it
