before I was totally frozen
my<00:02:33.510> heart<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:34.110> frozen<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:35.130> body<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.850> frozen

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.520 
my heart was frozen my body was frozen
it<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.230> cold<00:02:37.590> outside<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.670> inside<00:02:39.530> that's

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it was so cold outside and inside that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.470 
it was so cold outside and inside that's
the<00:02:40.800> main<00:02:43.280> that's<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.460> main<00:02:44.640> feeling<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.330> had

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.740 

can<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.170> say<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.709> clearly<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.459> don't<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
can I say it clearly I don't know and I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.540 
can I say it clearly I don't know and I
don't<00:03:09.780> know<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:12.209> mad<00:03:13.310> named<00:03:14.310> it

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
don't know if I can in mad named it

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.600 
don't know if I can in mad named it
correctly<00:03:15.030> because<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.860> don't<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:17.040> any<00:03:17.340> mark

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
correctly because I don't have any mark

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.229 
correctly because I don't have any mark
of<00:03:17.850> where<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.400> don't<00:03:20.790> know<00:03:21.090> what

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
of where I was and so I don't know what

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.330 
of where I was and so I don't know what
kind<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.630> adult<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.320> would<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:22.769> been<00:03:23.070> without

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
kind of adult I would have been without

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.509 
kind of adult I would have been without
it<00:03:23.820> because<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.750> was<00:03:24.989> only<00:03:25.200> 23<00:03:25.620> years<00:03:25.860> old<00:03:26.280> and

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it because I was only 23 years old and

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.090 
it because I was only 23 years old and
life<00:03:27.150> begins<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:27.989> 23<00:03:28.530> years<00:03:28.769> old

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
life begins at 23 years old

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.780 
life begins at 23 years old
so<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.900> thing<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.489> element<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:34.080> that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
so the thing I the element I think that

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.240 
so the thing I the element I think that
was<00:03:35.790> different<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.570> me<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:37.800> that

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
was different in me is that I think that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.590 
was different in me is that I think that
I<00:03:38.900> knew<00:03:39.900> then<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.530> life<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.459> very<00:03:41.940> very

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
I knew then that life is very very

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.780 
I knew then that life is very very
fragile<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:45.450> we<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.549> immortals<00:03:47.549> and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
fragile that we are not immortals and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.259 
fragile that we are not immortals and
knowing<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.780> at<00:03:49.110> 23<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.190> young<00:03:50.580> age<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.790> know

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
knowing it at 23 is a young age to know

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.000 
knowing it at 23 is a young age to know
it<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:52.019> feel<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.780> think<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.500> became

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
it to feel it and I think that I became

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.870 
it to feel it and I think that I became
probably<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.239> more<00:03:57.739> aware<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.430> beauty

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
probably a bit more aware that to beauty

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.440 
probably a bit more aware that to beauty
to<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.360> beauty<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.720> life<00:04:01.970> it's<00:04:02.970> led<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.420> to
