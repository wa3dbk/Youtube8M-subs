hello it's just a quick video today just
to<00:00:08.280> introduce<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.059> my<00:00:09.240> new<00:00:09.389> toy<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
to introduce it to my new toy the I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.160 
to introduce it to my new toy the I
taste<00:00:11.660> MVP<00:00:12.660> version<00:00:13.110> -<00:00:14.599> I've<00:00:15.599> been<00:00:15.719> after<00:00:16.049> one

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
taste MVP version - I've been after one

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
taste MVP version - I've been after one
of<00:00:16.199> these<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.619> quite<00:00:16.800> some<00:00:16.980> time<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.060> was

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
of these for quite some time but I was

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.960 
of these for quite some time but I was
told<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> hold<00:00:18.960> off<00:00:19.189> until<00:00:20.189> version<00:00:20.760> 2

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
told just to hold off until version 2

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
told just to hold off until version 2
was<00:00:21.150> released<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.500> glad<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> did<00:00:23.130> because

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
was released and I'm glad I did because

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
was released and I'm glad I did because
there's<00:00:23.850> some<00:00:24.029> extra<00:00:24.600> functionality<00:00:25.320> with

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
there's some extra functionality with

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.780 
there's some extra functionality with
the<00:00:25.980> version<00:00:26.400> 2<00:00:30.590> like<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> version<00:00:31.859> 1<00:00:32.250> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the version 2 like the version 1 it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
the version 2 like the version 1 it's
still<00:00:33.059> variable<00:00:33.570> voltage<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.649> still

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
still variable voltage and it still

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.510 
still variable voltage and it still
gives<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> puff<00:00:35.579> count<00:00:36.320> but<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.340> also

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
gives you a puff count but now it's also

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
gives you a puff count but now it's also
variable<00:00:39.210> wattage<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:45.270> also<00:00:45.420> checks<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
variable wattage it also checks the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910 
variable wattage it also checks the
resistance<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.370> atomizer<00:00:48.620> as<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.770> can

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
resistance of your atomizer as you can

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
resistance of your atomizer as you can
see<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> galell<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> I've<00:00:52.020> started

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
see this is an a galell and I've started

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.459 
see this is an a galell and I've started
to<00:00:52.500> build<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.070> own<00:00:53.100> coils<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> being<00:00:55.199> able<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
to build my own coils so being able to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.290 
to build my own coils so being able to
check<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> resistance<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> very

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
check the resistance this is a very

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
check the resistance this is a very
useful<00:00:57.449> feature<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.109> me<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.829> glad<00:00:59.010> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
useful feature for me so I'm glad they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.329 
useful feature for me so I'm glad they
included<00:00:59.699> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.569 

and<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> also<00:01:06.119> gives<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.600> display<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.430> how<00:01:08.430> much

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
and it also gives a display on how much

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.100 
and it also gives a display on how much
charge<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> left<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.780> your<00:01:09.930> battery

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
charge there is left on your battery

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.469 
charge there is left on your battery
you've<00:01:10.860> still<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> lag<00:01:11.490> display<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.299> goes

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you've still got the lag display it goes

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
you've still got the lag display it goes
from<00:01:12.689> green<00:01:12.869> amber<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> red<00:01:14.390> but<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.570> there's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
from green amber to red but now there's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.670 
from green amber to red but now there's
a<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:15.990> accurate<00:01:16.170> reading<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> meter<00:01:18.680> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
a more accurate reading on the meter so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.850 
a more accurate reading on the meter so
all<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> cracking<00:01:21.630> device<00:01:22.080> from

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
all in all it's a cracking device from

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:32.149 
all in all it's a cracking device from
50<00:01:23.640> pounds<00:01:24.090> including<00:01:24.720> delivery<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> think

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
50 pounds including delivery but I think

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.840 
50 pounds including delivery but I think
for<00:01:33.030> me<00:01:33.149> one<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.869> things<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
for me one of the first things that I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
for me one of the first things that I
noticed<00:01:35.990> was<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> build<00:01:37.709> quality<00:01:38.009> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
noticed was just the build quality and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.719 
noticed was just the build quality and
the<00:01:39.360> attention<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.959> detail<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.429> if<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the attention to detail it's as if the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.270 
the attention to detail it's as if the
designs<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:43.020> sat<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:43.950> thought

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
designs are really sat down and thought

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
designs are really sat down and thought
about<00:01:45.530> how<00:01:46.530> people<00:01:47.039> use<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.610> device<00:01:47.819> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
about how people use this device and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.690 
about how people use this device and
what<00:01:48.959> people<00:01:49.350> want<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> device<00:01:52.700> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
what people want from the device the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.850 
what people want from the device the
build<00:01:53.970> quality<00:01:54.209> it's<00:01:54.659> sturdy<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:56.250> solid

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
build quality it's sturdy it's solid

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.169 
build quality it's sturdy it's solid
it's<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.399> really<00:02:00.030> enjoying<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.800 

of<00:02:06.179> course<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> huge<00:02:07.170> battery<00:02:07.649> inside<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
of course is that huge battery inside I

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.210 
of course is that huge battery inside I
think<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.959> about<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.530> half<00:02:10.709> thousand

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
think it's about two and half thousand

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.660 
think it's about two and half thousand
mAh<00:02:12.019> so<00:02:13.019> once<00:02:13.590> you've<00:02:13.739> charged<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> battery

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
mAh so once you've charged the battery

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.660 
mAh so once you've charged the battery
you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.209> just<00:02:15.420> forget<00:02:15.750> about<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.519> or

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you can just forget about it for two or

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.220 
you can just forget about it for two or
three<00:02:17.880> days<00:02:18.090> depending<00:02:18.359> on<00:02:18.750> your<00:02:18.870> vaping

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
three days depending on your vaping

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.150 
three days depending on your vaping
style<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.910> comes<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.359> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
style you have it and it comes with the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.470 
style you have it and it comes with the
iclear<00:02:26.160> 30<00:02:27.440> tank<00:02:28.440> or<00:02:28.799> clearomizer<00:02:29.480> which

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
iclear 30 tank or clearomizer which

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.090 
iclear 30 tank or clearomizer which
holds<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:31.049> three<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.739> three-and-a-half

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
holds about three to three-and-a-half

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.140 
holds about three to three-and-a-half
mils<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.630> again<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:34.950> fill<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
mils so again you just fill that up and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
mils so again you just fill that up and
depending<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.660> your<00:02:36.750> vaping<00:02:37.079> style<00:02:37.440> that'll

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
depending on your vaping style that'll

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.250 
depending on your vaping style that'll
last<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.549> day<00:02:38.730> or<00:02:38.910> two<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.720> battery<00:02:40.139> will

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
last you a day or two the battery will

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.130 
last you a day or two the battery will
last<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:40.739> least<00:02:40.880> two<00:02:41.880> days

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.360 

so<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.290> also<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.680> very<00:02:47.890> good<00:02:48.040> device<00:02:48.340> for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
so it's also a very good device for

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.190 
so it's also a very good device for
beginner<00:02:48.959> because<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:52.269> mechanicals<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.080> I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
beginner because the mechanicals and I

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.770 
beginner because the mechanicals and I
still<00:02:53.440> love<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:53.620> mechanicals<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:55.060> laugh<00:02:55.360> does

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
still love my mechanicals you laugh does

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.160 
still love my mechanicals you laugh does
tend<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.260> revolve<00:02:56.709> around<00:02:57.659> batteries<00:02:58.659> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
tend to revolve around batteries and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.339 
tend to revolve around batteries and
charging<00:02:59.830> batteries<00:03:01.080> especially<00:03:02.080> if<00:03:02.140> you're

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
charging batteries especially if you're

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.080 
charging batteries especially if you're
building<00:03:02.920> your<00:03:03.220> own<00:03:03.250> coils<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.510> you're<00:03:04.690> using

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
building your own coils and you're using

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.280 
building your own coils and you're using
one<00:03:07.090> arm<00:03:07.120> or<00:03:07.540> one<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.110> half<00:03:08.290> are<00:03:09.180> resistance

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
one arm or one and a half are resistance

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.809 
one arm or one and a half are resistance
it<00:03:11.290> does<00:03:11.590> tend<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:11.950> drain<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.340> batteries<00:03:12.790> a

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
it does tend to drain the batteries a

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.050 
it does tend to drain the batteries a
lot<00:03:13.239> quicker<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.920> yeah<00:03:15.099> you<00:03:15.310> constantly

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
lot quicker and so yeah you constantly

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.670 
lot quicker and so yeah you constantly
having<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.360> think<00:03:16.569> about<00:03:16.930> how<00:03:17.349> have<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.500> got

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
having to think about how have I got

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.100 
having to think about how have I got
some<00:03:17.860> batteries<00:03:18.129> on<00:03:18.400> charge<00:03:18.849> have<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.750> got<00:03:19.930> some

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
some batteries on charge have I got some

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.339 
some batteries on charge have I got some
spare<00:03:20.530> batteries<00:03:21.220> fully<00:03:21.459> charged<00:03:22.349> whereas

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
spare batteries fully charged whereas

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.860 
spare batteries fully charged whereas
with<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.030> big<00:03:25.329> battery

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
with this because of that big battery

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.800 
with this because of that big battery
you<00:03:26.319> just<00:03:26.829> charge<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.549> up<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.269> forget<00:03:28.480> about

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you just charge it up you forget about

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.030 
you just charge it up you forget about
it<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:33.129> for<00:03:33.340> someone<00:03:33.519> who's<00:03:33.819> just<00:03:34.709> using<00:03:35.709> say

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
it so for someone who's just using say

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
it so for someone who's just using say
an<00:03:36.160> eagle<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.700> clearomizer<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:38.410> they're

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
an eagle and clearomizer but they're

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.830 
an eagle and clearomizer but they're
looking<00:03:38.950> for<00:03:39.160> another<00:03:39.370> device<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.480> next

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
looking for another device the next

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.789 
looking for another device the next
device<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.859> move<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.220> from<00:03:42.370> egos<00:03:43.590> really<00:03:44.590> see

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
device to move on from egos really see

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.330 
device to move on from egos really see
was<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.069> consider<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.819> envy<00:03:46.329> page<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:48.310> just

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
was to consider the envy page it just

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.699 
was to consider the envy page it just
does<00:03:48.700> everything<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.560> do

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
does everything you want it to do

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.849 
does everything you want it to do
variable<00:03:51.489> voltage<00:03:51.639> it's<00:03:52.120> variable<00:03:52.510> wattage

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
variable voltage it's variable wattage

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.089 
variable voltage it's variable wattage
checks<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:54.069> resistance<00:03:54.810> gives<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.959> a

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
checks the resistance gives you a

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.379 
checks the resistance gives you a
accurate<00:03:57.099> reading<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.730> how<00:03:57.910> much<00:03:58.060> charge

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
accurate reading of how much charge

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.990 
accurate reading of how much charge
there<00:03:58.599> is<00:03:58.630> left<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.169> battery<00:04:00.000> puff

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
there is left in the battery puff

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.050 
there is left in the battery puff
counter<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:03.250> does<00:04:03.430> everything<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.849> could

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
counter it does everything you could

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:12.479 
counter it does everything you could
possibly<00:04:04.090> want<00:04:08.250> or<00:04:09.250> for<00:04:09.579> under<00:04:10.060> 50<00:04:10.359> pounds

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
possibly want or for under 50 pounds

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.280 
possibly want or for under 50 pounds
so<00:04:13.489> it's<00:04:13.909> not<00:04:14.030> going<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.329> be<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.480> review<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.049> such

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
so it's not going to be a review as such

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.819 
so it's not going to be a review as such
it's<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:15.739> my<00:04:15.920> introduction<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:18.440> my<00:04:18.560> first

using this tomorrow what I'm going to be
doing<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.960> review<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.289> four<00:04:24.800> flavors<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.699> were

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
doing a review of four flavors that were

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.110
