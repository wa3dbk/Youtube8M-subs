about to take a tour

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.640 
about to take a tour
we<00:00:14.880> opened<00:00:15.299> approximately<00:00:15.900> ten<00:00:16.170> thousand

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we opened approximately ten thousand

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.040 
we opened approximately ten thousand
square<00:00:16.920> feet<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.150> 10,000<00:00:18.840> square

feet we've got eight new imaging
machines<00:00:22.560> we'll<00:00:23.220> probably<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:24.470> at<00:00:25.470> any<00:00:25.830> one

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.160 
here at this new of the Pepsi T has been
a<00:00:39.750> technology<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.739> been<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:42.450> a

a technology that's been around for a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
a technology that's been around for a
number<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:44.100> years<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.820> given<00:00:45.149> us<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
number of years it's given us the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
number of years it's given us the
opportunity<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.850> do<00:00:47.850> PET<00:00:48.120> CT<00:00:48.329> scans<00:00:48.899> on

infectious or inflammatory conditions of
the<00:00:58.170> musculoskeletal<00:00:58.620> system<00:00:58.820> what<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> pet

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the musculoskeletal system what the pet

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
the musculoskeletal system what the pet
gives<00:01:00.570> us<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.230> gives<00:01:01.440> us<00:01:01.590> physiologic

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
gives us is it gives us physiologic

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.440 
gives us is it gives us physiologic
information<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.820> CT<00:01:05.820> does<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
information and what the CT does is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.830 
information and what the CT does is
gives<00:01:06.900> us<00:01:07.049> specific<00:01:07.979> anatomic<00:01:08.840> information

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
gives us specific anatomic information

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
gives us specific anatomic information
so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.220> localize<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.360> area<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so we can out now localize an area of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.820 
so we can out now localize an area of
abnormality<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.430> pet<00:01:14.670> MRI<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.830> another

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
abnormality with pet MRI it's another

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
abnormality with pet MRI it's another
hybrid<00:01:17.159> technology<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:18.990> new

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
hybrid technology but this is a very new

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
hybrid technology but this is a very new
technology<00:01:20.240> we're<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> first<00:01:21.659> ones<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.610> have

technology we're the first ones to have

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370

it<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> Houston<00:01:24.450> area<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.840> we're

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it in the Houston area and we're

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.570 
it in the Houston area and we're
actually<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> first<00:01:26.040> free-standing

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
actually the first free-standing

Children's Hospital in the United States

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.999 
Children's Hospital in the United States
to<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.979> technology<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> combines

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
to have this technology but it combines

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
to have this technology but it combines
positron<00:01:32.009> emission<00:01:32.460> tomography<00:01:32.780> with

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

we<00:01:44.759> feel<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.689> about<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> 40%

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
we feel like we can get about a 40%

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.210 
we feel like we can get about a 40%
reduction<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.149> radiation<00:01:48.869> by<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.950> with

the<00:01:55.950> purpose<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.759> technology<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.659> really

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the purpose of this technology is really

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.950 
the purpose of this technology is really
what<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.799> call<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> distraction<00:01:59.850> technique<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
what we call a distraction technique so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
what we call a distraction technique so
when<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> walk<00:02:01.560> into<00:02:01.920> these<00:02:02.280> rooms<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.119> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
when you walk into these rooms and you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.020 
when you walk into these rooms and you
see<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.290> type<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> lighting

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
see the type of lighting

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.750 
see the type of lighting
and<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.510> give<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.170> child<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> parent<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
and you give a child or a parent the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.330 
and you give a child or a parent the
opportunity<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> select<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.680> environment

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
ambient experience works is that the
