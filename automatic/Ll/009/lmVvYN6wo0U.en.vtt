well as me doing this quest to this is

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.210 
well as me doing this quest to this is
that<00:06:21.700> point<00:06:21.970> they<00:06:22.840> are<00:06:22.990> rather<00:06:23.230> spread<00:06:24.040> wrong

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
that point they are rather spread wrong

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.820 
that point they are rather spread wrong
small<00:06:24.670> area<00:06:25.030> it's<00:06:26.020> not<00:06:26.110> going<00:06:26.350> back<00:06:26.530> that<00:06:26.770> way

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
small area it's not going back that way

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.010 
small area it's not going back that way
and<00:06:27.480> verifying<00:06:28.480> go<00:06:28.600> in<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.780> correct

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
and verifying go in the correct

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.900 
and verifying go in the correct
direction<00:06:29.080> try<00:06:29.980> not<00:06:30.190> so<00:06:30.460> it's<00:06:30.610> time<00:06:30.730> to<00:06:30.760> go

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
direction try not so it's time to go

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.090

back<00:06:30.940> this<00:06:31.300> way<00:06:31.510> instead<00:06:31.660> it<00:06:32.620> is<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.800> good<00:06:33.040> thing

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
back this way instead it is a good thing

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.130 
back this way instead it is a good thing
to<00:06:33.430> do

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
to do

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.990 
to do
and<00:06:36.140> now<00:06:36.260> I<00:06:36.290> spot<00:06:36.590> one<00:06:36.620> dead<00:06:37.070> ahead<00:06:37.190> which<00:06:37.790> I'm

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.970 
and now I spot one dead ahead which I'm
heading<00:06:38.330> for<00:06:38.540> bida<00:06:38.720> someone<00:06:39.590> else<00:06:39.740> is<00:06:39.830> going

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
heading for bida someone else is going

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440 
heading for bida someone else is going
for<00:06:40.130> that<00:06:40.220> vote<00:06:40.430> so<00:06:40.640> I<00:06:40.700> decided<00:06:41.030> to<00:06:41.090> let<00:06:41.270> them

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
for that vote so I decided to let them

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.090 
for that vote so I decided to let them
have<00:06:41.480> that<00:06:41.690> because<00:06:42.140> I'm<00:06:42.260> quite<00:06:42.710> nice<00:06:42.890> like

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
have that because I'm quite nice like

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.880 
have that because I'm quite nice like
that<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:44.810> ads<00:06:44.990> checking<00:06:45.380> he<00:06:45.470> was<00:06:45.620> getting

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890 
that the ads checking he was getting

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.440 
that the ads checking he was getting
free<00:06:46.100> in<00:06:46.220> case<00:06:46.400> he<00:06:46.520> wasn't<00:06:46.550> actually<00:06:47.270> into

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
free in case he wasn't actually into

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.880 
free in case he wasn't actually into
swimming<00:06:47.660> around<00:06:47.900> pointlessly<00:06:48.350> because<00:06:48.830> I

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
swimming around pointlessly because I

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.740 
swimming around pointlessly because I
would<00:06:49.040> have<00:06:49.130> gone<00:06:49.250> back<00:06:49.430> otherwise<00:06:49.750> however

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
would have gone back otherwise however

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.480 
would have gone back otherwise however
due<00:06:50.870> to<00:06:50.900> my<00:06:51.080> niceness<00:06:51.260> one<00:06:51.650> is<00:06:51.890> directly<00:06:52.310> in<00:06:52.430> my
