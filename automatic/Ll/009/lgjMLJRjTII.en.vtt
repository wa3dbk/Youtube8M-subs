00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.380
 yes everything is a bit to utsman 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.300
 currently celebrating these kittens 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:30.220
 sleep suit to such and yes I am never there 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:31.539
 and there is a third bedroom in it 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.489
 the full view 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.760
 found for a purple in the everything 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.760
 know 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:51.900
 yes i have sat you think of keeping that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 in which that studio 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:17.520
 there are also images of i was would it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:20.360
 just very messy oh yes in it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.289
 produce my next clip 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.119
 ah i think if you like the studio if you 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.000
 are in the studio with whoever has a video 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.750
 The link between the same applies to me 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.030
 principle 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 model you want something in teams anyway 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.200
 kind of in that which is your own 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.570
 with really what your thing is you leave there 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.750
 two others at that time 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.310
 or three other people also in it I have to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.690
 always get going 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.710
 certainly as good and actually and setting 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.540
 are a much nicer line in that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.360
 sticks happening its fun could just be 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.070
 free a certain creative energy 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.450
 I notice to say energy 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 career 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 I just want the best boxes to be 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 totally sensitive 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 you have to think together all the time 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.380
 just find it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.910
 and that can be in a serious conversation 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.930
 about something but there can also be in it 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.070
 funny to 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.910
 I think if two people can 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:30.020
 laugh then I think you really do 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:41.740

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.669
 if yes it is just its own musician 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.460

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.160
 for my feeling is very clear 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:59.280
 difference i probably just like that 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:03.330

 the end product a front is not the most 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.080
 important in fact 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.919
 most blister is that if you offer it 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.480
