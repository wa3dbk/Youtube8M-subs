really really nice but since the keys
are<00:00:34.410> spread<00:00:34.770> apart<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.820> much<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.780> might<00:00:37.140> take

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500

some time getting used to but you know

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.060 
some time getting used to but you know
but<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.620> okay<00:00:41.989> overall<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.860> nice

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070

um it has six gigs of ram and intel core

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.240 
um it has six gigs of ram and intel core
i7<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:27.060> you'll<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.860> plenty<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> power

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
i7 so so you'll have to plenty of power

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
i7 so so you'll have to plenty of power
for<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.360> um<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:34.579> it<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:35.790> has<00:01:36.090> blu<00:01:36.420> ray<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.530> i

for it um so it also has blu ray which i

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.760 
for it um so it also has blu ray which i
did<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.070> test<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:39.960> probably

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
did not test out but you know probably

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880 
did not test out but you know probably
work<00:01:41.340> another<00:01:42.270> great<00:01:42.810> feature<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.470> i<00:01:43.500> like

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
work another great feature that i like

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.850 
work another great feature that i like
is<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:45.210> button<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
is this button right here which is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.760 
is this button right here which is
displayed<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:47.549> button<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.750> i<00:01:48.810> press<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
displayed off button when i press it the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.120 
displayed off button when i press it the
displace<00:01:50.189> goes<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.140> reason<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.920> like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
displace goes back and the reason I like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.880 
displace goes back and the reason I like
it<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> sometimes<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.890> antivirus

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it is that sometimes you know antivirus

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.630 
it is that sometimes you know antivirus
scans<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.490> stuff<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.640> doesn't

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
scans for stuff and you know it doesn't

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.719 
scans for stuff and you know it doesn't
and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> leave<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.500> overnight<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and I have to leave it overnight and you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.810 
and I have to leave it overnight and you
know<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> doesn't<00:02:03.840> tax<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.290> display<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
