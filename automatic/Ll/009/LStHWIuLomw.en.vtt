and a more natural timing into the water
and<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.580> gonna<00:01:32.820> make<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.180> rip<00:01:33.390> really

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
thing you want to do before you start

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.820 
thing you want to do before you start
flipping<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.720> doing<00:02:48.900> all<00:02:48.990> your<00:02:49.110> plyometrics

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
flipping and doing all your plyometrics

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.010 
flipping and doing all your plyometrics
is<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.520> do<00:02:50.940> some<00:02:51.120> preventative<00:02:51.450> shoulder

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
is to do some preventative shoulder

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.590 
is to do some preventative shoulder
stuff<00:02:52.260> when<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:52.830> hit<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.130> water<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.880> wrists

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
stuff when we hit the water our wrists

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.090 
stuff when we hit the water our wrists
our<00:02:54.750> elbows<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.320> our<00:02:55.410> shoulders<00:02:55.739> take<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
our elbows and our shoulders take the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
our elbows and our shoulders take the
brunt<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.489> all<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.910> our<00:02:57.030> entry<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.690> really<00:02:57.989> want

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
brunt of all of our entry we really want

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.449 
brunt of all of our entry we really want
to<00:02:58.170> make<00:02:58.260> sure<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> our<00:02:58.709> shoulders<00:02:59.220> are

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to make sure that our shoulders are

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.430 
to make sure that our shoulders are
strong<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.270> then<00:03:00.660> we're<00:03:00.750> gonna<00:03:00.870> prevent<00:03:01.230> any

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
strong and then we're gonna prevent any

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380 
strong and then we're gonna prevent any
injuries<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.220> our<00:03:02.489> shoulders<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
injuries and our shoulders have a lot of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.060 
injuries and our shoulders have a lot of
little<00:03:03.810> bidding<00:03:03.989> muscles<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:04.950> these

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
little bidding muscles in them so these

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.160 
little bidding muscles in them so these
exercises<00:03:05.730> don't<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.150> monster<00:03:06.959> weights

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
exercises don't take monster weights

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.750 
exercises don't take monster weights
they're<00:03:07.440> not<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.830> difficult<00:03:08.040> exercises

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
they're not really difficult exercises

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.790 
they're not really difficult exercises
and<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.120> may<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.360> even<00:03:09.420> feel<00:03:09.930> much<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.680> it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
and you may not even feel much but it's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.020 
and you may not even feel much but it's
very<00:03:11.010> important<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.459> keep<00:03:11.580> these<00:03:11.700> small

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
very important to keep these small

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.720 
very important to keep these small
muscles<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.660> tune<00:03:12.959> because<00:03:13.380> if<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:14.310> muscle
