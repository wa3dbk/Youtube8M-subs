00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.900
 group 2 who honk those at

 declared non-runner because of the terrain 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.969
 seconds of opening stalls 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.190

 go get it this group race in 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.240
 was that I missed his belt 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.400
 and now go on we see pardons 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.780
 busto you told me during the race 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.890
 he wanted to leave before the boxes 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.410
 opens and suddenly see up there up up 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.690

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.330
 he finds himself almost last 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.350
 position so both the jockeys who 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.880

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.230
 that don bosco valley before so we 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.330
 let's go but that's an effort 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.560
 which is expensive to finish and look at the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.090
 progress of the action what will the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.370

 planters to have the excluded today I 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.590

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.780
 completely more breathe but in everything 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.970
 case even axios bar address horse 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.340
 group 1 and the revelation this is the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.930
 third which is very far from two 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.209
 first at the entrance the straight line and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.590
 who are doing on them to finish it's a 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.360
 good note for the future of anyway 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.680

 regarding the horse honestly 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.590
 he deserved his group 1 largely this 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.870
 year 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.220

 I'm happy we'll win 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.180
 stéphane I have the impression that 1850 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.370
 meters it's really the distance that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.990
 appreciate because there of a polka dot I 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.110
 am beaten by a horse that had 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.110
 outfit
