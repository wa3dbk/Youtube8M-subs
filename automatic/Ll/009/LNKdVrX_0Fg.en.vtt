00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
wrapping paper I mean so if I was going

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.150 
wrapping paper I mean so if I was going
to<00:00:46.820> do<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:47.570> could<00:00:48.350> measure<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:48.830> this<00:00:48.950> way

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
to do that I could measure it this way

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.470 
to do that I could measure it this way
but<00:00:49.220> I'm<00:00:49.460> going<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.670> end<00:00:49.790> up<00:00:49.910> with<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.150> lot<00:00:50.390> of

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
but I'm going to end up with a lot of

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.090 
but I'm going to end up with a lot of
extra<00:00:50.840> here<00:00:51.080> so<00:00:51.320> I'm<00:00:51.470> going<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.650> actually<00:00:51.770> wrap

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
extra here so I'm going to actually wrap

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400 
extra here so I'm going to actually wrap
this<00:00:52.310> present<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.000> way<00:00:53.150> so<00:00:53.870> line<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.080> up<00:00:54.260> at

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
this present this way so line it up at

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.150 
this present this way so line it up at
the<00:00:54.500> end<00:00:54.820> flip<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:55.970> up<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.540> over<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.890> I

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
the end flip it up and over and I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.340 
the end flip it up and over and I
clearly<00:00:58.670> have<00:00:58.820> enough<00:00:59.420> wrapping<00:00:59.960> paper<00:01:00.170> to

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
clearly have enough wrapping paper to

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.320 
clearly have enough wrapping paper to
cover<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.710> end<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:01.130> that's<00:01:01.280> great<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:02.120> just

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
cover the end so that's great and I just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.600 
cover the end so that's great and I just
want<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.540> fold<00:01:02.720> up<00:01:02.900> on<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.170> side<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:03.950> now<00:01:04.100> I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
want to fold up on the side here now I

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.120 
want to fold up on the side here now I
don't<00:01:04.939> need<00:01:05.119> quite<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:06.170> much<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.979> need

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
don't need quite that much you need

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.429 
don't need quite that much you need
about<00:01:07.270> enough<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.479> would<00:01:08.570> go<00:01:08.719> at<00:01:08.869> least<00:01:09.049> past

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
about enough that would go at least past

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.679 
about enough that would go at least past
halfway<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.520> usually<00:01:10.850> try<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.240> make<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.570> so

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
halfway so I usually try to make it so

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.719 
halfway so I usually try to make it so
that<00:01:11.719> goes<00:01:11.960> about<00:01:12.109> 3/4<00:01:12.649> of<00:01:12.679> the<00:01:12.859> way<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.130> then

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
that goes about 3/4 of the way and then

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.730 
that goes about 3/4 of the way and then
on<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.969> other<00:01:14.000> side<00:01:14.420> I'm<00:01:14.869> going<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.109> eyeball

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
on the other side I'm going to eyeball

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.359 
on the other side I'm going to eyeball
it<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.159> let<00:01:16.250> me<00:01:16.340> just<00:01:16.369> say<00:01:16.609> cut<00:01:16.999> it<00:01:17.030> about<00:01:17.210> here

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
it and let me just say cut it about here

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:28.150 
it and let me just say cut it about here
so<00:01:19.369> I'm<00:01:19.640> just<00:01:19.670> going<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.969> cut<00:01:20.149> my<00:01:20.270> paper

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.720 

put<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.640> side<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:31.130> then<00:01:32.130> I'm

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
put that off to the side and then I'm

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.020 
put that off to the side and then I'm
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.470> Center<00:01:34.470> my<00:01:34.710> box<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.940> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
going to Center my box right in the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.100 
going to Center my box right in the
center<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.620> those<00:01:37.710> people<00:01:38.190> that

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
center now I'm one of those people that

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
center now I'm one of those people that
likes<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> fold<00:01:40.650> over<00:01:40.950> her<00:01:41.280> ends<00:01:41.760> because<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
likes to fold over her ends because that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
likes to fold over her ends because that
way<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.140> I've<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.530> any<00:01:43.770> ragged<00:01:44.340> edges<00:01:44.610> from

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
way if I've got any ragged edges from

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
way if I've got any ragged edges from
cutting<00:01:45.650> that<00:01:46.650> we'll<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
cutting that we'll make sure that that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
cutting that we'll make sure that that
goes<00:01:47.729> away<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.330> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> fold<00:01:48.660> over<00:01:48.869> my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
goes away so I'm going to fold over my

going to take the edge here and you see

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.229 
going to take the edge here and you see
how<00:02:08.040> there's<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> empty<00:02:08.729> space<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.119> here

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
how there's this empty space in here

how there's this empty space in here
what<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.050> going

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
to take the edge and we're going to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.449 
to take the edge and we're going to
crease<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.030> along<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.230> top<00:02:13.500> part<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> box

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
that these little triangles form so I

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.350 
that these little triangles form so I
push<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.680> finger<00:02:20.010> down<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.820> crease<00:02:21.330> a
