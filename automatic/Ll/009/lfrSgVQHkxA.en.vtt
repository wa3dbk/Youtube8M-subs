 weeks from different parts of the country 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.000
 the first president issues 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 This is why it was not the first time that a leading university invited the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 president to spread to the Ecuadorian people 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.510

 of miracle santa elena quevedo 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.960
 the state university of guayaquil 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 where he had a mass meeting 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 they developed with absolute tranquility 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.200
 the same thing that happened in the catholic university of guayaquil problem for more 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.590
 one hour the others 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.950

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.810
 university students indicated that the unama 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.580
 even the head of state invited body those students who could not 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.579
 enter due to lack of physical space 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.790
 there are some guys who could not get in this afternoon 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.450
 but in the first prison in the upper part there is still something of the past 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.750
 it does not matter if he is with him not as long as he is respectful of democracy 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 Welcome 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.119
 but to be welcome 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.659
 but little by little 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.659
 the trap that the Guayaquil oligarchy had prepared 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.149
 he was discovering 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.569
 with the forced presence of no more than twenty students 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:25.709
 who showed up to boycott the presidential message and in this way 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.289
 they were building quito 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:31.799
 the slogan then was clear 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.089
 to insult 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.299
 to offend 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.299
 and create chaos by using these young people who lent themselves 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.339
 confront the president 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.339
 the violence 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.859
 already for that, express instructions had been dictated and right there 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.349
 the director of the surveillance and security service 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.749
 of the municipality of guayaquil andrés roche 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.129
 who behind the students used 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.239
 I watched 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 how these guys fulfilled their role 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.670
 Andre Roche 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.609
 apart from inciting students 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.739
 he ordered his guards and the young people themselves to pull out as 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.260
 a video camera to the professor of the catholic university fabian burbano 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.369
 who had recorded it in the middle of the mob 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.499
 so he announced today that he will not go down 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.669
 as a soldier 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.199
 he has accompanied the piano 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.949
 with the change of coach 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.109
 the group of students 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.739
 in favor of not haranguing in favor of the 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.949
 lowers the restaurant chamber 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.290
 high in the service they do not achieve it by the security council always 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.869
 trying to remove the tc what we hear once 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.739
 we think about that 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.279
 yesterday the third 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:53.489
 tourism 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.879
 official from the municipality of guayaquil was also present 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.909
 among the protesters 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.409
 the total arrogance grew in close 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.879
 under his shoulders cared for a student who attributed the success 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.859
 they put a padlock on him and left him inside for more than three hours 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.499
 they were conducted to create bewilderment and anarchy 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.260
 it was so obvious 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.259
 and when the president finished his radio station 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 things took another turn the outside of the university 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.039
 the small crowd of students became more aggressive 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.020
 and he was waiting for the president to leave to insult him, and in this way 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.590
 confuse public opinion 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.850
 that is why while the president received samples of affection 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.699
 that filled with tears 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.020
 I was a little 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.020
 and talk to the cicus step of the university 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 the little mob thought that the head of state did not leave 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990
 by the protesters 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.159
 so 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.159
 the cries were heard with more force 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.259
 toxo 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.689
 Saturday 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.669
 who were looking for studies 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.610
 that they really wanted 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.610
 assaulting the president with violence 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.520
 they were ready for the fight 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.939
 they then clearly showed their true option 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.770
 just looking for what the president floors always never 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.249
 has had his options 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.719
 that they fix the situation 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.770
 because it is death to the arrogance letter garcia tezanos 400 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.219
 and 50 kilos to get the most 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.740
 and they want to prevent the president 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.650
 in the session 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.180
 but mister lord rector of being an actor is a disgrace for the university 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.310
 and I'm not going to leave offending the presidential round so guys, but that's what 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.790
 same the problem is that they are 400 the 2 50 ask them or wood that they learn to be 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.030
 democratic and learn to debate with ideal 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.539
 not with the arrogance of certain 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.099
 it was clear that the forecasts were tickets and staged pizzas and eat 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.119
 by the students of the no 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:18.869
 The pressure was such that it was enough for a student to show his sympathy for 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:19.800
 hitler 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 to receive these insults 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.520
 ap in the same way 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.410
 another student 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.740
 in favor of the yes 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.759
 he was rebuked and provoked 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.379
 looking for conflict 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.379
 but this never reacted 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.050
 they are the same as in the streets of guayaquil on an individual basis 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.900
 the same arrogance with its own neighbors 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:53.399
 No one will fit anyone will do well 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.330
 to the citizens 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.669
 in acts similar to those carried out at the Catholic university 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.830
 verbally attack citizens 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.599
 and the streets of the city 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.599
 I do not share your ideas from right 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.240
 also redrado 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.230
 to prepare the arrival at the headquarters of the embassy's value-added chain 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.680
 North American 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 morning to the morning woman 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.009
 this is how to act 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.710
 this is how they usually treat 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.800
 to his brothers of the liberal senator Juan Manuel Galán Alta 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.300
 we still have not won anything, they did not reach an agreement 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.009
 flags to help in the search for a woman in alhama de granada 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.159
 pomegranate 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.629
 and the model's wedding
