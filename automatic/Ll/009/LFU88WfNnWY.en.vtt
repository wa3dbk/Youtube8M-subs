00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
problems but there's not really that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.430 
problems but there's not really that
much<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.819> change<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.480> far<00:03:39.959> as<00:03:40.049> if<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.260> need

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
much of a change as far as if you need

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.960 
much of a change as far as if you need
to<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:40.859> audio<00:03:41.160> levels<00:03:41.609> I<00:03:41.670> pretty<00:03:41.880> much

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
to up the audio levels I pretty much

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.390 
to up the audio levels I pretty much
have<00:03:42.299> them<00:03:42.480> turned<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.500> about<00:03:43.680> ninety<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
have them turned up to about ninety to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.949 
have them turned up to about ninety to
ninety-five<00:03:44.730> percent<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.389> hundred<00:03:45.660> percent<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
ninety-five percent a hundred percent of

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.140 
ninety-five percent a hundred percent of
the<00:03:46.019> time<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.950> don't<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.730> lot<00:03:48.120> of

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the time so I don't have a lot of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.059 
the time so I don't have a lot of
adjustment<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.260> could<00:03:49.440> make<00:03:49.620> into<00:03:49.889> there

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
adjustment that I could make into there

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.490 
adjustment that I could make into there
so<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.060> find<00:03:51.359> myself<00:03:51.540> having<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.170> lot<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
so I find myself having a lot of the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.379 
so I find myself having a lot of the
audio<00:03:52.769> levels<00:03:53.100> very<00:03:53.340> very<00:03:53.609> high<00:03:53.819> or<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.239> get
