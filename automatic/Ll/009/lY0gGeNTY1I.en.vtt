what I want to do is I want to glue all

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
what I want to do is I want to glue all
these<00:00:33.030> together<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:34.110> create<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.649> of

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
these together to create a lot of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.350 
these together to create a lot of
dimension<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.550> card<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
dimension on my card which will make it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
dimension on my card which will make it
easier<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.110> painting<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.610> stay<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
easier to do the painting and to stay in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
easier to do the painting and to stay in
the<00:00:39.210> line<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> speak<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.590> once<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.950> cut<00:00:41.160> them

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the line so to speak so once I cut them

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
the line so to speak so once I cut them
I'm<00:00:41.460> using<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> zig<00:00:42.090> glue<00:00:42.300> pen<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> apply

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I'm using a zig glue pen just to apply

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.860 
I'm using a zig glue pen just to apply
adhesive<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> small<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.390> pieces

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
adhesive to all the small little pieces

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.110 
adhesive to all the small little pieces
like<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> stems<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
like the stems and then also to all of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.020 
like the stems and then also to all of
the<00:00:48.300> buds<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> flowers<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.940> I'll

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the buds and the flowers and then I'll

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
the buds and the flowers and then I'll
just<00:00:51.210> take<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> next<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just take the next one and this is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.139 
just take the next one and this is
really<00:00:52.980> easy<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:53.789> die-cut

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really easy because they're die-cut

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.060 
really easy because they're die-cut
they're<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.449> exactly<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.960> same<00:00:55.050> I'll<00:00:55.590> just

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
they're all exactly the same I'll just

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.209 
they're all exactly the same I'll just
line<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> lay<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.239> top<00:00:58.039> I'll<00:00:59.039> make

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
line it up and lay it on top I'll make

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.029 
line it up and lay it on top I'll make
sure<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.750> sticks<00:01:01.559> together<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
sure that it all sticks together and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
sure that it all sticks together and
then<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.969> I'll<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.300> I'll<00:01:03.629> repeat<00:01:03.930> this

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
then what I'll do is I'll repeat this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
then what I'll do is I'll repeat this
process<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.949> other<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:05.729> remaining<00:01:06.180> dies

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
process for the other two remaining dies

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.109 
process for the other two remaining dies
and<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.650> keep<00:01:07.860> gluing<00:01:08.220> them<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and just keep gluing them one on top of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.649 
and just keep gluing them one on top of
the<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:13.909> once<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.119> done<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.479> can

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the other so once that's done you can

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
the other so once that's done you can
really<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.500> great<00:01:16.890> dimension<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
really see the great dimension that you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
really see the great dimension that you
get<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.150> almost<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> faux<00:01:19.290> sort<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
get it's almost like a faux sort of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.429 
get it's almost like a faux sort of
chipboard<00:01:20.040> look<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.600> working<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
chipboard look so I'm working now on the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
chipboard look so I'm working now on the
back<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.100> applying<00:01:23.369> another<00:01:23.729> layer<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
back and I'm applying another layer of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.429 
back and I'm applying another layer of
glue<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> use

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
glue and this is what I'm going to use

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.039 
glue and this is what I'm going to use
to<00:01:25.680> glue<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.009> down<00:01:26.220> onto<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.060> next<00:01:27.869> piece<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to glue this down onto my next piece of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
to glue this down onto my next piece of
paper<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:28.680> will<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.009> watercolor<00:01:29.490> paper

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
paper which will be watercolor paper

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.660 
paper which will be watercolor paper
again<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.200> paper<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.590> using<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.100> Canson

that it's on there really strong because

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.109 
that it's on there really strong because
I<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> adding<00:01:41.549> water<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.240> piece<00:01:42.479> so

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
I will be adding water to this piece so

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.389 
I will be adding water to this piece so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
watercolor panel and then I'll just turn

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
watercolor panel and then I'll just turn
that<00:01:53.850> over<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> trim<00:01:54.720> those<00:01:54.990> stems<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.619> the

these<00:02:24.710> particular<00:02:24.890> watercolors<00:02:25.790> today

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
these particular watercolors today

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.610 
these particular watercolors today
because<00:02:26.390> they're<00:02:26.540> very<00:02:26.840> bold<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.410> vibrant

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.610 
because they're very bold and vibrant
and<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.210> wanted<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.750> look<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.290> these

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330

with more water and Pat that where the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.390 
with more water and Pat that where the
colors<00:03:08.510> meet<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.050> allow<00:03:09.590> them<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.830> mix<00:03:10.190> and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.210 
colors meet and allow them to mix and
blend<00:03:10.630> now<00:03:11.630> because<00:03:12.020> this<00:03:12.260> die<00:03:12.590> cut<00:03:12.830> piece<00:03:13.010> has

been<00:03:13.400> stacked<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.600> really<00:03:14.900> easy<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.230> stay

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
been stacked it's really easy to stay

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.080 
been stacked it's really easy to stay
like<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.860> said<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.310> lines<00:03:16.520> or<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:16.940> stay

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
like I said in the lines or just stay

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.970 
like I said in the lines or just stay
right<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.750> die<00:03:17.930> cut<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.320> not<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.739> on<00:03:18.860> to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
right on the die cut and not going on to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.380 
right on the die cut and not going on to
the<00:03:19.070> background<00:03:19.400> because<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:19.880> have<00:03:20.120> that

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
the background because you have that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.810 
the background because you have that
lift<00:03:20.690> or<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.019> dimension<00:03:21.590> with<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.310> die<00:03:22.580> cut

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
lift or that dimension with the die cut

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.810 
lift or that dimension with the die cut
and<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:24.320> look<00:03:24.560> when<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.890> do<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.400> really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
and the look when you do this is really

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.670 
and the look when you do this is really
fun<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.120> almost<00:03:26.450> looks<00:03:26.720> kind<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.110> sculptural

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
fun it almost looks kind of sculptural

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.240 
fun it almost looks kind of sculptural
like<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.160> sculptured<00:03:30.040> onto<00:03:31.040> that

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
like it's sculptured onto that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.949 
like it's sculptured onto that
background<00:03:31.730> piece<00:03:32.030> of<00:03:32.209> cardstock<00:03:32.480> or

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
background piece of cardstock or

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.759 
background piece of cardstock or
watercolor<00:03:33.920> paper<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.260> continued<00:03:36.650> that

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
watercolor paper so we continued that

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.340 
watercolor paper so we continued that
same<00:03:36.980> process<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.660> flowers<00:03:39.080> and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
same process for all of the flowers and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.410 
same process for all of the flowers and

then the stems as well knows I just

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.970 
then the stems as well knows I just
painted<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.840> basic<00:03:42.200> green<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.410> didn't<00:03:42.769> do<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> lot

of shading and now I'm ready to do the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
of shading and now I'm ready to do the
background<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.190> I'm<00:03:46.280> putting<00:03:46.549> on<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.730> pretty

thick<00:03:47.390> layer<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.630> water<00:03:48.340> right<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.730> the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
thick layer of water right up to the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.610 
thick layer of water right up to the
edge<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.269> those<00:03:50.420> die-cut<00:03:50.840> pieces<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.530> again

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
edge of those die-cut pieces and again

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.100 
edge of those die-cut pieces and again
that's<00:03:51.920> really<00:03:52.250> easy<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.549> do<00:03:52.850> because<00:03:53.120> they're

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
that's really easy to do because they're

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.530 
that's really easy to do because they're
stacked<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.739> high<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.250> then<00:03:55.910> I'm<00:03:56.030> dropping<00:03:56.239> in

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
stacked so high and then I'm dropping in

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.470 
stacked so high and then I'm dropping in
the<00:03:56.570> blue<00:03:56.900> color<00:03:57.260> for<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.680> sky<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.480> then

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
the blue color for the sky and then

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.820 
the blue color for the sky and then
blending<00:03:59.930> it<00:04:00.049> out<00:04:00.140> with<00:04:00.200> more<00:04:00.560> water<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.739> you

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
blending it out with more water so you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.199 
blending it out with more water so you
can<00:04:03.950> see<00:04:04.100> once<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.430> drop<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.820> in<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.060> just

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
can see once you drop that in it just

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.610 
can see once you drop that in it just
naturally<00:04:05.780> blends<00:04:06.140> out<00:04:06.230> where<00:04:06.470> you've

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
naturally blends out where you've

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.350 
naturally blends out where you've
applied<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:07.130> water<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.239> go<00:04:08.330> back

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
applied the water and you can go back

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.330 
applied the water and you can go back
and<00:04:08.750> pick<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:08.900> more<00:04:09.140> water<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.709> blend<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.070> even

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
and pick up more water to blend it even

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.699 
and pick up more water to blend it even
more<00:04:13.660> I'll<00:04:14.660> just<00:04:14.810> work<00:04:14.989> my<00:04:15.049> way<00:04:15.350> around<00:04:15.470> the

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
more I'll just work my way around the

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.780 
more I'll just work my way around the
flowers<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.340> go<00:04:17.410> about<00:04:18.410> 80%<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> way<00:04:19.519> down

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
flowers I go about 80% of the way down

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.430 
flowers I go about 80% of the way down
towards<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.450> ground<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:21.049> then<00:04:21.140> I'll<00:04:21.229> leave

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
towards the ground and then I'll leave

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.839 
towards the ground and then I'll leave
that<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.890> go<00:04:21.979> in<00:04:22.099> and<00:04:22.220> paint<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.580> in<00:04:22.729> the

that and go in and paint that in the

that and go in and paint that in the
same<00:04:23.090> manner<00:04:23.360> but<00:04:23.990> using<00:04:24.410> greens<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.919> yellows

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740
