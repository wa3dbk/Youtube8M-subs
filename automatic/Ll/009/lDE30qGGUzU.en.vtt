00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
thinking of building it again that's

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.879

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
obviously you know back row destruction

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.330 
obviously you know back row destruction
because<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.110> necros<00:05:13.440> wasn't<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:13.889> important

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
because the necros wasn't so important

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.770 
because the necros wasn't so important
so<00:05:14.430> besti<00:05:14.729> re<00:05:14.850> isn't<00:05:15.090> going<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:15.270> do<00:05:15.360> too<00:05:15.570> much
