00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello to all of you have a desire to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.650
 buns but no time for you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 throw in the preparation of a brioche 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.130
 graphic 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.260
 this recipe is for you it's the game 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 fast who ask no reason of cause 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.970
 nor kneading and lends them in one 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.730
 powerful hour and preparation included 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.170
 so we start by mixing all the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000
 ingredients seem in a big 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 bowl 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 I put some flour I add yeast 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 baker we are going to refurbish the sugar 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.750
 vanilla I put four spoons to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.260
 banned sugar soup I put the butter 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 molten 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.230
 the salt is there we will mix everything 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 simply using a spoon in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.050
 wood by adding As the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 milk so we're not going to knead we're just going 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.570
 mix until you have a dough 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.390
 homogeneous that all the ingredients are 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.350
 incorporate well into the preparation 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.330
 as usual the detail of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 ingredients and on the site my flower 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 orange points like to access them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.659
 you click on the plate 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.560
 beginning at the end of the video or on the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560
 link in info bar 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.830
 in the end we obtain a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.420
 is not very sticky 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.610
 but do not worry, we're going 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.440
 simply pour it into a mold to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:53.140
 parchment paper notes to avoid 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:54.880
 that sticks to decorate the brioche of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.310
 sprinkle with sesame seeds 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 can also put granulated sugar on 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.240
 oven preheated to 80 degrees I'm going 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.850
 bake it right away 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.220
 so for 20 minutes that's what will 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.990
 allow the benauge to rise and then I 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.149
 will raise the temperature to 200 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.420
 degrees and I cook for 30 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.260
 additional minutes at the exit of the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.680
 oven let cool before serving 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.550
 the result is really surprising 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.600
 it's different from the classic brioche 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.200
 but it still has a texture 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.959
 mellow between buns and cakes for 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.530
 a quick trip and the really very 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.780
 very good so you can serve her 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 either with honey jam or 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.730
 the spread according to the taste of 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.920
 each 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.780
 I hope this recipe sd a movie 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.330
 that you will try it will dispute 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.459
 without thought for that the same posted two 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.470
 photos of brushac risks taken on the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.580
 facebook page I tell you we are
