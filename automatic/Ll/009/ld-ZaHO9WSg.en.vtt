 of the so-called green leafy vegetables 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.160
 green precisely because of the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 chlorophyll that makes up these leaves 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.980

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.570
 a steak and amino acid antioxidants 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 I'm never really really good at it 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.260
 for all is well we have understood that the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.230
 rule 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.900
 it is important to hire a raw it could 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.380
 we know very well that even a taste 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.370
 then it takes a problem 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.400
 how to introduce in our 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.860
 power supply and or we discovered a 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 very simple and fast way not much 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.880
 very tasty as a supplement 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.880
 in power and here comes into play 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.040
 our juice at every day 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.940
 helps us to load ourselves with vitamins i 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.060

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.390
 fruits and vegetables 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.540
 let's see who showed us ours 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.790
 preferred that we called it morilla 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.950

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 everyday 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.190
 here what we abuse between ours 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.200
 gorilla grape juice ok 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.000
 as we said the black cabbage 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.470
 Tuscan that you can easily find 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.050
 in winter the then market 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.630
 we use a pineapple we use the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.330
 simply organic apples then 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.300
 we begin to cut rather than we want 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.180
 just to show how cut less 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.410
 Italian year in a very simple manner and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.630
 fast 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.470
 also in this case we do so 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.140
 let the technology come to us 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.810
 so let's use this let's say so 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.530
 we can call it a foreigner I do n't know though 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.610
 it's really very very simple because 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:58.690
 thanks to these hooks I do in 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:01.860
 this way is a lot both a girl and 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.860
 both the appeal 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.099
 the interior 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.340
 which is the whole story and now it comes into 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.170
 this way we took away our Easter 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.680
 certain squat is not that one wants 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.680
 subscription 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
 then we turn on our down 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.950
 price 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.950
 then 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.870
 let's hope 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.870
 our green ones 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.630
