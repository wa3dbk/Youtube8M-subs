00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
but when you also need to do is you need

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.660 
but when you also need to do is you need
to<00:05:32.840> include<00:05:33.200> God<00:05:33.590> in<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:33.890> because<00:05:34.040> God<00:05:34.430> always

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
to include God in it because God always

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.310 
to include God in it because God always
wants<00:05:35.030> better<00:05:35.150> things<00:05:35.510> for<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:35.810> then<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.050> can

even<00:05:36.500> dream<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.920> you<00:05:37.610> know<00:05:37.730> life<00:05:37.940> beyond<00:05:38.330> your

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
even dream of you know life beyond your

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.020 
even dream of you know life beyond your
wildest<00:05:38.900> dreams<00:05:39.170> if<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.920> are<00:05:40.220> imagining<00:05:40.580> a

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030

boyfriend who's 6 42 and tall and dark
and<00:05:44.810> handsome<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:46.040> think<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.760> just<00:05:46.790> might<00:05:47.300> be

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
and handsome I think that just might be

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.300 
and handsome I think that just might be
mine<00:05:47.690> but<00:05:47.930> anyway<00:05:48.260> if<00:05:48.470> you're<00:05:48.770> thinking<00:05:49.040> of

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
mine but anyway if you're thinking of

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.700 
mine but anyway if you're thinking of
that<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.510> universe<00:05:50.900> has<00:05:51.140> someone<00:05:51.440> even

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
that then the universe has someone even

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.070 
that then the universe has someone even
better<00:05:51.860> in<00:05:52.160> store<00:05:52.400> for<00:05:52.640> you<00:05:52.790> so<00:05:53.660> allow<00:05:54.020> the

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
better in store for you so allow the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.460 
better in store for you so allow the
universe<00:05:54.440> to<00:05:54.620> work<00:05:55.010> with<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.490> because<00:05:56.470> it
