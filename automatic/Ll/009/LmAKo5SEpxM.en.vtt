00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 yes 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 ma 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.890
 the rowing with four months of planning 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.140
 the first option that's how 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.080
 with this we seek is that the seeds do not feel the finished product and not 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.919
 as simple the final consumer 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 the second position will awaken the flavors 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.339
 When you revoke the grains the water they absorb 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.459
 to dissipate two flavors in the dough the finished product 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 third 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.770
 is to maintain the consistency of lamas 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.260
 to us and another of the grain 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 we got that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.600
 the grains do not absorb water in the mass or the contents but it is water 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 hectares and you forget oprah zorrilla 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.180
 before the planning process 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.630
 I knew we managed to not only keep the consistency to the downside 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.830
 but also increase the lifespan 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.390
 the last vestige that we achieve with the rank is to increase the performance 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.770
 since the grains 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.950
 to absorb seven amount of water in that in that lapse that we have stored 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.610
 you have to be clear 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 that each one has a certain 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 absorption percentage that you want to go 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 but we hope that it can be absorbed percent of its weight 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.980
 titles of which they will only absorb half of their weight 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.280
 that we will only know with which experimentation because it will depend on 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.410
 grain moisture 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.320
 and the conditions with which it was stored this holder was harvested on 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.310
 With a simple first thing we have to do is add all 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.600
 our seeds 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.070
 we can make homeless a single seed of seeds 15 million does not have any 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 inconvenient 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 n the next step, that is, the year 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.500
 After having muddied these seeds have mixed 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.810
 and there city water 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 we mix them 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.810
 the way to finish if the amount of water we throw 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.690
 it was enough 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.840
 is over is the daily 'sport' moments 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.699
 minimum we have to reflect the grains three hours before discussing saints 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:17.409
 The ideal 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.719
 would leave them to soak for 12 or 15 hours 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.149
 in the case of split wheat or wheat 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.729
 it is recommended 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.489
 store them in drift to avoid a fermentation today without giving a little 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.379
 of salt 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.589
 if the moment we only realize 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:37.719
 that I get wet has free water means that we have to reduce the amount 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.159
 but if on the contrary we realize 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.200
 that the soaking is very dry we have to be a little 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.599
 in conclusion 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.319
 the amount of water we have to finish it by experimentation
