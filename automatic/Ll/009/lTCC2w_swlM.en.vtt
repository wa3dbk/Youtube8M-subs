00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
crazy but awesome in its own way and it

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.350 
crazy but awesome in its own way and it
almost<00:04:29.350> makes<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.860> scene<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.640> ride

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
almost makes that scene like a ride

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.820 
almost makes that scene like a ride
that's<00:04:31.570> what's<00:04:31.780> great<00:04:31.870> about<00:04:31.960> 3d<00:04:32.560> in<00:04:32.680> this

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
that's what's great about 3d in this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.590 
that's what's great about 3d in this
especially<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.520> for<00:04:33.970> that<00:04:34.120> one<00:04:34.270> scene<00:04:34.330> I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
especially just for that one scene I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.750 
especially just for that one scene I
think<00:04:34.660> it's<00:04:35.169> worth<00:04:35.740> checking<00:04:36.130> out<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.460> 3d<00:04:36.640> just

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
think it's worth checking out in 3d just

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.500 
think it's worth checking out in 3d just
for<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> one<00:04:37.600> scene<00:04:38.910> and<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> little

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
for that one scene and for a little

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.510 
for that one scene and for a little
comparison<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.200> actually<00:04:41.919> have<00:04:42.190> my<00:04:42.370> original
