00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.560
 Hello my name is Mathias Strodel I am preparing an Asian for you today 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.349
 Cabbage salad with fried tofu too 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.479
 You start with electricity 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.249
 back to the base 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.249
 and then a strike is not going on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.359
 No 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 come to 8 come nor has the Queen also disagree 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.289
 for that were 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.289
 fine planed 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 the same with the Rettig made the tea towel raised 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.140
 and then I have a spring run 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.910
 and which cut 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.890
 and all together 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.710
 so 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.050
 then the pressing could prepare 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.410
 to 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.620
 Hawk black seeds pan without fat on Wall Street 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.830
 well, half of it offshoots some salt in the north 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 and and 4 2 final 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.710
 instead of 200 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 It is said that if they did not have any points can be used 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 they collect 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780
 then go to me 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.900
 and want 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240
 KlÃ¶ckner's whole 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 and a little further away 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.370
 and a pinch of salt 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.430
 Ott 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.700
 18 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 and yet they are do agree 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 and give that over the salad 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 mix the cut 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 to be able to set up employees in Korea 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 and let it drain for 20 minutes 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.180
 the 2 4 million 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.980
 cut one centimeter thick pieces 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.409
 the world is now in the head bumping process 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.749
 and then that comes with a little oil in the hot phase these met 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.749
 Emergency services geared up 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.019
 last it was not attached and dry in gigs in the semester 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.750
 and then I can still have the salad here 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.750
 to taste with SOLEOS 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
 informed 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.909
 it was already on the horizontal bar 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.909
 Tanner a little bit off his head 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:44.109
 2 Shorten the whole thing still with the black ones you are 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.349
 then the concept is already finished 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.509
 I wish you lots of fun cooking and enjoy your meal
