00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is the free motion quilting
tutorial<00:00:02.760> for<00:00:02.970> lollipop<00:00:03.510> flower<00:00:04.069> this<00:00:05.069> design

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
tutorial for lollipop flower this design

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.160 
tutorial for lollipop flower this design
starts<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.210> center<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.540> your<00:00:06.690> quilting

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
starts in the center of your quilting

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.810 
starts in the center of your quilting
space<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> first<00:00:08.519> thing<00:00:08.610> you're

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
space and so the first thing you're

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.820 
space and so the first thing you're
going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> stitch<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.780> circle<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.620> could

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
going to do is stitch a circle you could

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
going to do is stitch a circle you could
also<00:00:11.099> stitch<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.730> cluster<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> circles<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
also stitch a cluster of circles or a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.919 
also stitch a cluster of circles or a
spiral<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.920> entirely<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.179> then

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
spiral it's entirely up to you and then

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
spiral it's entirely up to you and then
you're<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> branch<00:00:16.650> off<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.010> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you're going to branch off from that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.810 
you're going to branch off from that
center<00:00:17.820> circle<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.470> lollipop<00:00:20.310> petals

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
center circle with some lollipop petals

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
center circle with some lollipop petals
so<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.779> did<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.199> straight<00:00:22.439> line<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so you just did just straight line a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790 
so you just did just straight line a
circle<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.720> inside<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.380> circle

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
circle and you go inside of that circle

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.519 
circle and you go inside of that circle
and<00:00:25.980> fill<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> closed<00:00:26.970> spiral<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and fill it with a closed spiral and a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
and fill it with a closed spiral and a
closed<00:00:28.800> spiral<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.369> basically<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.970> fill<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
closed spiral is basically you fill the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
closed spiral is basically you fill the
circle<00:00:31.170> completely<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> spiral<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
circle completely with the spiral and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.819 
circle completely with the spiral and
then<00:00:32.910> travel<00:00:33.480> stitch<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.170> back<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.649> of

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
then travel stitch your way back out of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.639 
then travel stitch your way back out of
it<00:00:35.090> it's<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.480> simple<00:00:36.870> design<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it it's a very very simple design and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
it it's a very very simple design and
you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you can see that I'm just kind of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
you can see that I'm just kind of
generally<00:00:39.600> moving<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> quilting

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
generally moving around the quilting

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.970 
generally moving around the quilting
space<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.670> starting<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.989> base<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.559> four

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
space in starting with a base of four

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
space in starting with a base of four
petals<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.559> very

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
petals and I do this because it's very

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.479 
petals and I do this because it's very
easy<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:48.059> brain<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.629> space<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.500> four

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
easy for my brain to space out four

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
easy for my brain to space out four
petals<00:00:51.329> around<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.079> center<00:00:52.350> circle<00:00:52.640> simply

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
petals around the center circle simply

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180 
petals around the center circle simply
because<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> keep<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
because I you know I kind of keep the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
because I you know I kind of keep the
compass<00:00:56.550> rose<00:00:56.760> north<00:00:57.239> south<00:00:57.570> east<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.079> west

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
compass rose north south east and west

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
compass rose north south east and west
in<00:00:58.710> mine<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.910> able<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.329> evenly<00:01:00.690> spaced

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in mine and I'm able to evenly spaced

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
in mine and I'm able to evenly spaced
out<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> petals<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.309> simply<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.969> inside

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
out the petals and then simply go inside

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
out the petals and then simply go inside
of<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> Stitch<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.949> pedal<00:01:05.309> kind<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
of them and Stitch a pedal kind of in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
of them and Stitch a pedal kind of in
between<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:08.010> keeps<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.460> very

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
between and that really keeps it very

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
between and that really keeps it very
consistent<00:01:09.479> keeps<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.140> design<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.799> even

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
consistent keeps the design very even

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.390 
consistent keeps the design very even
and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> fact<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.080> has<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.710> my

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and I like the fact that this has on my

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.899 
and I like the fact that this has on my
flower<00:01:15.210> design<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> generally

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
flower design so I'm going to generally

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.539 
flower design so I'm going to generally
kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> move<00:01:18.450> around<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.170> flower<00:01:19.560> filling

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
kind of move around this flower filling

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.660 
kind of move around this flower filling
like<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.780> between<00:01:22.670> even

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
like this and then go in between even

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
like this and then go in between even
the<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.750> first<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.409> base<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.799> eight

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the the first kind of base of eight

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.770 
the the first kind of base of eight
petals<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.000> sign<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.450> between

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
petals and go and sign it in between

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.649 
petals and go and sign it in between
those<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.189> petals<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
those with even more petals and you can

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
those with even more petals and you can
see<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> generally<00:01:31.829> filled

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
see that this kind of generally filled

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
see that this kind of generally filled
and<00:01:32.689> because<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.930> stitching<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and because I was stitching into a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
and because I was stitching into a
square<00:01:35.329> my<00:01:36.329> petals<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.020> ended<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.409> being

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
square my petals can have ended up being

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
square my petals can have ended up being
in<00:01:37.950> rather<00:01:38.189> kind<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.909> square<00:01:39.360> arrangement

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in rather kind of a square arrangement

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
in rather kind of a square arrangement
you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.829> how<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> corner<00:01:41.970> one's<00:01:42.180> kind<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you can see how the corner one's kind of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
you can see how the corner one's kind of
stretch<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> adds<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
stretch out and that kind of adds to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.639 
stretch out and that kind of adds to
that<00:01:44.159> effect<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.420> find<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.990> happening

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that effect if you find that happening

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
that effect if you find that happening
and<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.460> flower<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.090> look<00:01:48.210> more

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and you want your flower to look more

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
and you want your flower to look more
like<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> flower<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.409> more<00:01:49.619> circular<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.430> you
