hello this is Matt Cedarburg from
t-splines<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.500> tutorial<00:00:04.980> will<00:00:05.100> show

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
t-splines and this tutorial will show

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.629 
t-splines and this tutorial will show
how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.609> create<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.629> organic<00:00:07.639> editable

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
how to create in organic editable

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.629 
how to create in organic editable
t-splines<00:00:09.269> bottle<00:00:10.219> using<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.280> method<00:00:11.580> of

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
t-splines bottle using a method of

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.999 
t-splines bottle using a method of
merging<00:00:12.120> together<00:00:12.269> NURBS<00:00:12.840> surfaces<00:00:13.500> created

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
merging together NURBS surfaces created

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.029 
merging together NURBS surfaces created
from<00:00:14.219> rhino's<00:00:14.580> NURBS<00:00:14.910> commands<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.800> first

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
from rhino's NURBS commands so the first

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.279 
from rhino's NURBS commands so the first
step<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:17.640> create<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.080> NURBS

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
step is to actually create the NURBS

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.150 
step is to actually create the NURBS
surfaces<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.980> need<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
surfaces so first of all we need to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
surfaces so first of all we need to
model<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> curves<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:24.960> define<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
model the curves that will define the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.980 
model the curves that will define the
bottle<00:00:25.800> design<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.539> design<00:00:27.840> I've

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
bottle design and for this design I've

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
bottle design and for this design I've
gone<00:00:28.140> ahead<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.439> laid<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.400> base<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
gone ahead and laid out the base and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.630 
gone ahead and laid out the base and
mouth<00:00:30.449> profiles<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.949> bottom<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> neck

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
mouth profiles the bottom and neck

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
mouth profiles the bottom and neck
sections<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.050> main<00:00:34.590> body

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
sections as well as the main body

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.370 
sections as well as the main body
profile<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.390> we'll<00:00:36.540> use<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.960> curves

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
profile and then we'll use these curves

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.799 
profile and then we'll use these curves
to<00:00:37.680> create<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.219> six<00:00:38.579> NURBS<00:00:38.969> surfaces<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to create the six NURBS surfaces that

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
to create the six NURBS surfaces that
define<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> basic<00:00:40.649> shape<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> design<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
define the basic shape of the design so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
define the basic shape of the design so
first<00:00:42.600> we'll<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> Rhino<00:00:43.290> revolve

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
first we'll use the Rhino revolve

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.510 
first we'll use the Rhino revolve
command<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:45.180> create<00:00:45.930> surfaces<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> mouth

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
command to create surfaces for the mouth

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.110 
command to create surfaces for the mouth
and<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.390> base<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> bottle<00:00:49.940> next<00:00:50.940> we'll

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and the base of the bottle next we'll

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.590 
and the base of the bottle next we'll
use<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.780> sweep<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.250> rail<00:00:53.489> command<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
use the sweep with one rail command to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.819 
use the sweep with one rail command to
make<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:55.289> sides<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.340> main<00:00:56.719> bottle

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
make two sides of the main bottle

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.450 
make two sides of the main bottle
profile<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:03.199> after<00:01:04.199> these<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.070> sides<00:01:05.280> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
profile and after these two sides have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
profile and after these two sides have
been<00:01:05.489> done<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.420> we'll<00:01:06.600> use<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> sweep<00:01:07.409> two

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
been done then we'll use the sweep two

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.179 
been done then we'll use the sweep two
rails<00:01:08.250> command<00:01:09.170> using<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.710> sides<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
rails command using the sides of the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.370 
rails command using the sides of the
body<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> rails<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.979> create<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.000> other

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
body as the rails to create the other

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.270 
body as the rails to create the other
two<00:01:16.380> sides<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.970> main<00:01:18.360> body<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.830> bottle

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
two sides of the main body of the bottle

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
two sides of the main body of the bottle
so<00:01:20.659> now<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.439> main<00:01:22.950> nerves<00:01:23.220> or

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so now we have all the main nerves or

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
so now we have all the main nerves or
the<00:01:23.820> main<00:01:24.000> NURBS<00:01:24.240> surfaces<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> describe

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the main NURBS surfaces that describe

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.249 
the main NURBS surfaces that describe
the<00:01:25.500> general<00:01:25.710> shape<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> bottle<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
the general shape of the bottle and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
the general shape of the bottle and
we'll<00:01:28.259> go<00:01:28.380> ahead<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.979> rebuild<00:01:29.579> these

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
we'll go ahead and rebuild these

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
we'll go ahead and rebuild these
surfaces<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.630> match<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> isoparms<00:01:32.900> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
surfaces to match up the isoparms the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.880 
surfaces to match up the isoparms the
reason<00:01:34.140> why<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.350> doing<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.860> because

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
reason why we're doing this is because

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
reason why we're doing this is because
we<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.000> merging<00:01:36.509> all<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.780> surfaces

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we will be merging all these surfaces

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
we will be merging all these surfaces
together<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> single<00:01:38.189> editable<00:01:38.939> t-spine

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
together into a single editable t-spine

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.920 
together into a single editable t-spine
surface<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.240> desirable<00:01:42.600> they

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
surface and it's so it's desirable they

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
surface and it's so it's desirable they
have<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.470> nerve<00:01:43.619> surfaces<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> their<00:01:44.610> ISO

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
have the nerve surfaces have their ISO

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.969 
have the nerve surfaces have their ISO
curves<00:01:45.119> lined<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.590> makes<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
curves lined up that just makes the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
curves lined up that just makes the
surface<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.490> editable<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.329> isn't

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
surface more editable this isn't

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
surface more editable this isn't
necessary<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.009> makes<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.549> more

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
necessary but it just makes it a more

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
necessary but it just makes it a more
workable<00:01:51.630> t-spline<00:01:52.140> surface<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.729> using

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
workable t-spline surface so we're using

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.569 
workable t-spline surface so we're using
the<00:01:54.090> Rhino<00:01:54.299> rebuild<00:01:55.020> command<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.130> rebuild

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the Rhino rebuild command to rebuild

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.660 
the Rhino rebuild command to rebuild
each<00:01:56.909> NURBS<00:01:57.240> surface<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.549> when<00:01:59.549> you're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
each NURBS surface and when you're

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
each NURBS surface and when you're
rebuilding<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.600> optimum<00:02:00.990> control<00:02:01.229> point

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
rebuilding the optimum control point

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.459 
rebuilding the optimum control point
count<00:02:02.689> will<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.810> different<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.229> every

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
count will be different for every

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.730 
count will be different for every
scenario<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:07.290> control<00:02:07.710> points

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
scenario if you have more control points

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
scenario if you have more control points
in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> rebuild<00:02:08.489> surface<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> will

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
in the rebuild surface then it will

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.449 
in the rebuild surface then it will
deviate<00:02:10.140> less<00:02:10.470> from<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> original<00:02:11.190> surface

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
deviate less from the original surface

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.190 
deviate less from the original surface
but<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.030> will<00:02:12.090> also<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:12.510> difficult<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
but it will also be more difficult to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.580 
but it will also be more difficult to
edit

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
edit

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
edit
and<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.519> course<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.879> have<00:02:15.000> fewer<00:02:15.239> control

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and of course if you have fewer control

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.509 
and of course if you have fewer control
points<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.319> makes<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.590> surface<00:02:16.950> easier

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
points then it makes your surface easier

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.130 
points then it makes your surface easier
to<00:02:17.700> edit<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.750> might<00:02:18.930> lose<00:02:19.110> some

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
to edit but you might lose some

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.350 
to edit but you might lose some
curvature<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.550> best<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.879> rebuild<00:02:21.209> with

the<00:04:16.709> mouth<00:04:16.889> of<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.130> bottle<00:04:17.280> first<00:04:17.970> we'll<00:04:18.269> go

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
the mouth of the bottle first we'll go

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.190 
the mouth of the bottle first we'll go
ahead<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.720> extrude<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.349> top<00:04:19.590> border<00:04:20.280> edges

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
ahead and extrude the top border edges

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.600 
ahead and extrude the top border edges
what<00:04:22.200> this<00:04:22.320> does<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.800> buffers<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.130> start

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
what this does is it buffers the start

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.860 
what this does is it buffers the start
point<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.000> used<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.240> be<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.570> edge<00:04:24.659> of<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
point that used to be on the edge of the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.120 
point that used to be on the edge of the
surface<00:04:25.229> now<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.440> start<00:04:25.740> points<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.039> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
surface now the start points in the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.670 
surface now the start points in the
middle<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.460> this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
middle of this

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.230 
middle of this
surface<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.669> has<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.970> effect<00:04:28.030> of

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
surface and it has the effect of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.790 
surface and it has the effect of
smoothing<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.870> surface<00:04:29.259> or<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.560> star

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
smoothing the surface or in the star

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.249 
smoothing the surface or in the star
point<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.270> in<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.419> we've<00:04:31.539> emerged<00:04:31.750> those<00:04:32.020> two

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
point so in that we've emerged those two

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.770 
point so in that we've emerged those two
together<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:33.759> go<00:04:33.880> ahead<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.270> improve<00:04:34.630> the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
together we can go ahead and improve the

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.800 
together we can go ahead and improve the
topology<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.650> bottle<00:04:35.979> our<00:04:36.940> goal<00:04:37.630> is<00:04:37.780> to

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
topology of the bottle our goal is to

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.650 
topology of the bottle our goal is to
have<00:04:38.050> all<00:04:38.320> four<00:04:38.350> sided<00:04:39.070> phases<00:04:39.580> because<00:04:39.940> that

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
have all four sided phases because that

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.200 
have all four sided phases because that
yields<00:04:41.229> a<00:04:41.320> smoother<00:04:41.770> surface<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:42.789> do<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.090> we

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
yields a smoother surface so do that we

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.900 
yields a smoother surface so do that we
first<00:04:43.449> delete<00:04:43.870> some<00:04:44.110> edges<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.680> then<00:04:45.550> go

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
first delete some edges and then go

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.060 
first delete some edges and then go
ahead<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.330> insert<00:04:46.720> some<00:04:47.050> vertices<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.949> get

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
ahead and insert some vertices to get

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.969 
ahead and insert some vertices to get
four-sided<00:04:48.639> faces<00:04:49.060> using<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.509> TS<00:04:49.979> insert

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979

next step will be to close the bottom of
the<00:05:12.729> bottle<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.830> again<00:05:14.830> we'll<00:05:14.979> switch<00:05:15.220> over

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
the bottle and again we'll switch over

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.779 
the bottle and again we'll switch over

close the bottom just select one edge of
the<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.400> hole<00:05:21.639> and<00:05:21.820> run<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.120> TS<00:05:22.419> fill

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the of the hole and run the TS fill

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.800 
the of the hole and run the TS fill
command<00:05:24.150> then<00:05:25.150> we'll<00:05:25.300> go<00:05:25.360> ahead<00:05:25.449> and<00:05:25.570> add<00:05:25.780> some

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
command then we'll go ahead and add some

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.290 
command then we'll go ahead and add some
more<00:05:26.110> points<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.070> model<00:05:27.370> using<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.669> TSN

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
more points to the model using the TSN

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.420 
more points to the model using the TSN
certain<00:05:28.509> point<00:05:28.750> command<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.949> we<00:05:30.130> can

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
certain point command so that we can

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.670 
certain point command so that we can
decrease<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.479> number<00:05:31.930> of<00:05:31.960> sides<00:05:32.289> on<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
decrease the number of sides on the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.350 
decrease the number of sides on the
incited<00:05:33.190> surface<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.820> get<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.940> smoother

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
incited surface and get a smoother

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.460 
incited surface and get a smoother
surface<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:39.520> here<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.479> completed<00:05:41.139> outer

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.250 
surface so here is the completed outer
surface<00:05:42.010> of<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.190> bottle<00:05:42.750> now<00:05:43.750> we<00:05:43.810> will<00:05:44.139> go

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
surface of the bottle now we will go

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.969 
surface of the bottle now we will go
ahead<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.770> thicken<00:05:45.449> the<00:05:46.449> t-spine<00:05:46.870> surface<00:05:47.349> to

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
ahead and thicken the t-spine surface to

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.040 
ahead and thicken the t-spine surface to
give<00:05:48.820> it<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.120> volume<00:05:51.300> this<00:05:52.300> will<00:05:52.539> be<00:05:52.630> done<00:05:52.840> using

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
give it a volume this will be done using

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.969 
give it a volume this will be done using
the<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.740> TS<00:05:54.039> thicken<00:05:54.460> command<00:05:54.789> and<00:05:55.979> the

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
the the TS thicken command and the

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.589 
the the TS thicken command and the
service<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.430> be<00:05:57.550> thickened<00:05:57.820> either<00:05:58.030> freehand

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
service can be thickened either freehand

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.350 
service can be thickened either freehand
or<00:05:58.780> by<00:05:58.900> typing<00:05:59.289> typing<00:06:00.220> an<00:06:00.370> exact<00:06:00.699> distance<00:06:00.909> in

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
or by typing typing an exact distance in

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.300 
or by typing typing an exact distance in
this<00:06:01.930> case<00:06:02.139> will<00:06:02.349> thicken<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.770> surface<00:06:03.130> by

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
this case will thicken the surface by

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.920 
this case will thicken the surface by
0.3<00:06:03.880> units<00:06:04.210> and<00:06:04.570> we'll<00:06:04.659> do<00:06:04.780> that<00:06:04.930> in<00:06:05.110> words<00:06:05.320> and

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
0.3 units and we'll do that in words and

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.589 
0.3 units and we'll do that in words and
now<00:06:07.930> we<00:06:07.990> have<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:10.139> volume<00:06:11.820> for<00:06:12.820> our<00:06:13.120> t-spine

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
now we have a volume for our t-spine

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.800 
now we have a volume for our t-spine
surface<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.889> after<00:06:15.159> thickening<00:06:15.669> we<00:06:16.479> will

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
surface so after thickening we will

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.110 
surface so after thickening we will
smooth<00:06:17.560> out<00:06:17.740> part<00:06:18.039> of<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.220> internal<00:06:18.729> surface

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
smooth out part of the internal surface

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.670 
smooth out part of the internal surface
since<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.449> detail<00:06:19.810> on<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:20.139> outside<00:06:20.530> of<00:06:20.620> the

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
since the detail on the outside of the

inside<00:06:23.349> of<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.530> mouth<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.970> see<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.270> interior

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
inside of the mouth to see the interior

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.830 
inside of the mouth to see the interior
will<00:06:25.990> use<00:06:26.229> a<00:06:26.259> rhino's<00:06:27.120> clip<00:06:28.120> clipping<00:06:28.630> plane

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
will use a rhino's clip clipping plane

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.170 
will use a rhino's clip clipping plane
command<00:06:29.199> then<00:06:30.159> we<00:06:30.280> can<00:06:30.400> just<00:06:30.550> select<00:06:30.699> all<00:06:31.000> the

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
command then we can just select all the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.870 
command then we can just select all the
edges<00:06:31.479> that<00:06:31.509> give<00:06:31.900> unwanted<00:06:32.740> detail<00:06:33.099> in<00:06:33.699> this

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
edges that give unwanted detail in this

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.219 
edges that give unwanted detail in this
mouth<00:06:34.120> region<00:06:34.479> and<00:06:35.169> then<00:06:35.889> we<00:06:36.159> will<00:06:36.479> hit<00:06:37.479> the<00:06:37.960> L

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
mouth region and then we will hit the L

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.559 
mouth region and then we will hit the L
hotkey<00:06:38.860> just<00:06:39.279> like

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
hotkey just like

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.899 
hotkey just like
the<00:06:39.659> whole<00:06:39.839> edge<00:06:40.050> loop<00:06:40.409> and<00:06:40.679> then<00:06:41.309> delete<00:06:41.699> them

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
the whole edge loop and then delete them

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.989 
the whole edge loop and then delete them
to<00:06:42.719> smooth<00:06:43.439> the<00:06:43.649> surface<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.490> you<00:06:44.550> can<00:06:44.669> see<00:06:44.819> how

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
to smooth the surface so you can see how

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:47.389 
to smooth the surface so you can see how
as<00:06:45.240> those<00:06:45.569> iso<00:06:45.809> curves<00:06:46.169> are<00:06:46.349> deleted<00:06:46.830> the

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:47.399 
as those iso curves are deleted the

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.219 
as those iso curves are deleted the
surface<00:06:47.759> is<00:06:47.909> smoothed<00:06:48.209> out<00:06:48.360> on<00:06:48.539> the<00:06:48.629> interior

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
surface is smoothed out on the interior

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.989 
surface is smoothed out on the interior
of<00:06:49.319> the<00:06:49.439> bottle<00:06:49.770> will<00:06:50.129> smooth<00:06:50.369> out<00:06:50.490> one<00:06:50.729> more

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:50.999 
of the bottle will smooth out one more

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.639 
of the bottle will smooth out one more
edge<00:06:51.899> loop<00:06:52.259> and<00:06:53.330> now<00:06:54.330> we<00:06:54.389> have<00:06:54.689> a<00:06:54.990> nice<00:06:55.289> smooth

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:55.649 
edge loop and now we have a nice smooth

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.969 
edge loop and now we have a nice smooth
interior<00:06:56.399> for<00:06:57.149> the<00:06:57.240> bottle<00:06:57.569> at<00:06:58.439> that<00:06:58.740> point

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
interior for the bottle at that point

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.980 
interior for the bottle at that point
the<00:06:59.099> models<00:06:59.399> done<00:06:59.639> so<00:06:59.999> we<00:07:00.119> can<00:07:00.209> either<00:07:00.389> edit<00:07:00.689> it

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
the models done so we can either edit it

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.109 
the models done so we can either edit it
more<00:07:01.529> by<00:07:01.800> just<00:07:01.979> moving<00:07:02.129> to<00:07:02.429> spines<00:07:02.699> control

00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:03.119 
more by just moving to spines control

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:05.689 
more by just moving to spines control
points<00:07:03.479> or<00:07:04.139> convert<00:07:04.679> it<00:07:04.800> to<00:07:04.830> NURBS<00:07:05.129> by<00:07:05.429> running

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
points or convert it to NURBS by running

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.329 
points or convert it to NURBS by running
the<00:07:05.909> T<00:07:06.839> splines<00:07:07.050> convert<00:07:07.619> to<00:07:07.740> Rhino<00:07:07.919> surface

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:08.339 
the T splines convert to Rhino surface

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:12.760 
the T splines convert to Rhino surface
command<00:07:10.039> but<00:07:11.039> that's<00:07:11.219> the<00:07:11.399> completed<00:07:11.759> bottle

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
command but that's the completed bottle

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.449 
command but that's the completed bottle
so<00:07:13.770> here's<00:07:14.189> a<00:07:14.279> rendering<00:07:15.029> of<00:07:15.899> the<00:07:16.319> bottle<00:07:16.619> and
