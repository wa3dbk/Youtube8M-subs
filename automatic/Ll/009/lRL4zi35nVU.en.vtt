00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
showing the Wi-Fi down low it's that

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.200 
showing the Wi-Fi down low it's that
tiny<00:00:06.839> stick<00:00:07.170> here<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:08.460> really<00:00:08.700> doesn't<00:00:09.000> get<00:00:09.120> in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
tiny stick here it really doesn't get in

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.759 
tiny stick here it really doesn't get in
your<00:00:09.330> way<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:09.690> playing<00:00:09.870> because<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
your way we're playing because when you

your way we're playing because when you
play<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.010> usually<00:00:11.309> hold<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.790> like<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.000> in

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
play you usually hold it like this in

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.440 
play you usually hold it like this in
your<00:00:12.509> hand<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.400> no<00:00:14.400> no<00:00:14.700> way<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.299> in

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
your hand so no no way it can get in

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.920 
your hand so no no way it can get in
your<00:00:15.570> hand<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.020> um<00:00:17.119> actually<00:00:18.119> uses<00:00:18.570> less<00:00:18.900> power

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
your hand so um actually uses less power

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
your hand so um actually uses less power
than<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.650> internal<00:00:20.039> model<00:00:20.369> which<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> bit

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
than the internal model which was a bit

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
than the internal model which was a bit
weird<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.600> okay<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
weird but okay and you can use the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.609 
weird but okay and you can use the
network<00:00:23.970> manager<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.720> connect<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> any

network manager to connect to any

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.519 
network manager to connect to any
networks<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.340> examples<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:28.349> one

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
networks for examples I go to that one

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.999 
networks for examples I go to that one
it<00:00:29.099> asks<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:29.580> passkey<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.660> one<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.009> WPA

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it asks for passkey this one is a WPA

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.190 
it asks for passkey this one is a WPA
and<00:00:32.160> wpa2<00:00:32.820> network<00:00:33.950> yes<00:00:34.950> WEP<00:00:35.940> WPA<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.660> wpa2

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and wpa2 network yes WEP WPA and wpa2

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
and wpa2 network yes WEP WPA and wpa2
were<00:00:37.680> fine<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.219> stick<00:00:38.610> its<00:00:38.790> beam<00:00:39.059> testa

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
were fine with that stick its beam testa

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
were fine with that stick its beam testa
so<00:00:40.320> let's<00:00:40.590> connect<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.250> networks<00:00:41.670> are

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so let's connect to my networks are

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
so let's connect to my networks are
already<00:00:42.840> set<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> key<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.070> doesn't<00:00:44.399> ask

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
already set up the key so it doesn't ask

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.720 
already set up the key so it doesn't ask
for<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.910> any<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.370> start

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
for it any more it just just will start

system<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.319> include<00:04:47.530> documentation<00:04:47.830> for

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
system to include documentation for

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.390 
system to include documentation for
example<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.150> documentation<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:50.199> Atari<00:04:51.099> let's

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
example is documentation for Atari let's

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.869 
example is documentation for Atari let's
say<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:53.069> it<00:04:54.069> will<00:04:54.220> then<00:04:54.400> show<00:04:54.639> you<00:04:54.699> a

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
say and it will then show you a

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.570 
say and it will then show you a
documentation<00:04:55.620> toss<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.800> up<00:04:56.889> you<00:04:57.069> will<00:04:57.099> need<00:04:57.550> a

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
documentation toss it up you will need a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.779 
documentation toss it up you will need a
toaster<00:04:57.879> on<00:04:58.120> file<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:59.650> operating<00:05:00.130> system<00:05:00.520> and

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
toaster on file the operating system and

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.730 
toaster on file the operating system and
it<00:05:01.180> tells<00:05:01.479> us<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.870> we<00:05:02.020> should<00:05:02.199> copy<00:05:02.440> it<00:05:02.590> over

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
it tells us that we should copy it over

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.040 
it tells us that we should copy it over
so<00:05:03.490> let's<00:05:03.729> assume<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.240> didn't<00:05:04.509> copy<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.810> over

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
so let's assume I didn't copy it over

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.430 
so let's assume I didn't copy it over
yet<00:05:06.539> so<00:05:07.539> I'm<00:05:08.440> just<00:05:08.680> going<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.949> run<00:05:09.130> hatari<00:05:09.580> and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.100 
yet so I'm just going to run hatari and
it<00:05:11.440> will<00:05:11.620> say<00:05:11.830> morning<00:05:12.280> plaistow<00:05:12.880> spunk<00:05:13.270> IMG
