00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
should still have a stimulating effect

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.199 
should still have a stimulating effect
and<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> next<00:02:00.890> one<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.520> they<00:02:01.759> put<00:02:02.000> the

a<00:02:06.350> video<00:02:06.500> we've<00:02:06.710> done<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.009> past<00:02:07.189> I've

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
a video we've done in the past I've

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.260 
a video we've done in the past I've
versatile<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:09.410> know<00:02:09.500> again<00:02:09.860> another

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
versatile one you know again another

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.809 
versatile one you know again another
possible<00:02:11.270> stimulating<00:02:11.810> effect<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.819> think

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
possible stimulating effect I think

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.000 
possible stimulating effect I think
usplabs<00:02:14.450> house<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:16.540> anabolic<00:02:17.540> effect<00:02:18.010> they

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
usplabs house it as anabolic effect they

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.350 
usplabs house it as anabolic effect they
also<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.370> another<00:02:19.550> fat<00:02:19.819> burner<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.269> they

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
also have another fat burner and they

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
also have another fat burner and they
say<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.720> can<00:02:20.989> have<00:02:21.170> some<00:02:21.410> weight<00:02:21.590> loss<00:02:21.800> order

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
say that can have some weight loss order

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.449 
say that can have some weight loss order
fat<00:02:22.760> burning<00:02:23.150> effect<00:02:23.450> size<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.459> next

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
fat burning effect size so next

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.530

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
increase nitric oxide levels and also it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.630 
increase nitric oxide levels and also it
can<00:03:02.840> inhibit<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.650> breakdown<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.250> nitric

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
can inhibit the breakdown of nitric

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.370 
can inhibit the breakdown of nitric
oxide<00:03:05.000> because<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.780> watch<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.079> lot<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.230> her

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
entered oxide production but body what's

entered oxide production but body what's
maintaining<00:03:12.799> homeostasis<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.790> going<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
maintaining homeostasis so it's going to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.910 
maintaining homeostasis so it's going to
go<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.239> there<00:03:14.359> break<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.780> down<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.769> is

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
go in there break that down and this is

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.220 
go in there break that down and this is
also<00:03:16.069> said<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.459> break<00:03:17.060> down<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.359> enzyme<00:03:18.019> that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
also said to break down that enzyme that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.470 
also said to break down that enzyme that
it<00:03:18.799> breaks<00:03:18.950> down<00:03:19.100> nitric<00:03:19.489> oxide<00:03:19.850> or<00:03:20.090> inhibit

it breaks down nitric oxide or inhibit

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.650 
it breaks down nitric oxide or inhibit
the<00:03:20.540> enzyme<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.989> should<00:03:21.139> say<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.660> housing

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
the enzyme I should say so housing

then vitamin C at the end so it's a
relatively<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:32.180> guess<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.840> could<00:03:32.959> say<00:03:33.049> strong

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
relatively I guess you could say strong

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.559 
relatively I guess you could say strong
formula<00:03:34.040> because<00:03:34.220> they<00:03:34.310> do<00:03:34.430> have<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.639> smaller

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
formula because they do have a smaller

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.300 
formula because they do have a smaller
bottle<00:03:35.870> gentleman<00:03:36.440> with<00:03:36.560> pre<00:03:36.769> workouts<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
bottle gentleman with pre workouts the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.039 
bottle gentleman with pre workouts the
larger<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.819> bottle<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.569> more<00:03:38.870> you're<00:03:39.019> able

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
larger the bottle the more you're able

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.780 
larger the bottle the more you're able
to<00:03:39.350> take<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.889> scoop<00:03:40.130> size<00:03:40.310> are<00:03:40.489> generally

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
to take is a scoop size are generally

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.860 
to take is a scoop size are generally
bigger<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.389> should<00:03:41.569> be<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.690> pretty

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
bigger so this should be a pretty

formula<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.959> was<00:03:54.109> leaked<00:03:54.380> by<00:03:54.829> somebody<00:03:55.340> and

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
formula that was leaked by somebody and

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.400 
formula that was leaked by somebody and
then<00:03:55.700> now<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.359> final<00:03:56.750> formula<00:03:57.139> so

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
then now this is the final formula so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.379 
then now this is the final formula so
the<00:03:57.829> one<00:03:58.069> we<00:03:58.280> have<00:03:58.459> on<00:03:58.639> our<00:03:58.670> website<00:03:59.150> won't<00:03:59.299> be

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
the one we have on our website won't be

consider<00:04:00.740> final<00:04:01.220> formula<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:02.560> think<00:04:03.560> he's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
consider final formula so I think he's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.350 
consider final formula so I think he's
got<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.950> few<00:04:04.160> extra<00:04:04.280> ingredients<00:04:04.850> attitude<00:04:05.210> is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
got a few extra ingredients attitude is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.620 
got a few extra ingredients attitude is
in<00:04:05.900> comparison<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.560> other<00:04:06.770> one<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.910> you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
in comparison to the other one and you

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.300 
in comparison to the other one and you
know<00:04:08.750> what<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.410> just<00:04:09.680> want<00:04:09.830> using<00:04:09.980> greedy

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
know what I'm just want using greedy

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.560 
know what I'm just want using greedy
apply<00:04:10.520> notice<00:04:10.850> there's<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.090> little<00:04:11.120> bit<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
apply notice there's a little bit of a

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.720 
apply notice there's a little bit of a
crossover<00:04:12.020> from<00:04:12.320> versatile<00:04:12.740> one<00:04:12.920> or<00:04:13.160> i<00:04:13.580> should

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
crossover from versatile one or i should

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.110 
crossover from versatile one or i should
say<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.210> first<00:04:15.050> 11<00:04:15.230> also<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.120> check

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
say the first 11 also but the check

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.420 
say the first 11 also but the check
micros<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:17.959> they<00:04:18.410> share<00:04:18.709> some<00:04:18.950> similar<00:04:19.220> games

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
micros so they share some similar games

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.710 
micros so they share some similar games
but<00:04:19.670> they<00:04:19.760> are<00:04:19.880> different<00:04:20.180> person

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
but they are different person

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.600 
but they are different person

little bit more of a kick or two but I

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.340 
little bit more of a kick or two but I
hadn't<00:04:53.360> really<00:04:53.540> heard<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:53.840> much<00:04:53.930> for<00:04:54.110> people

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
hadn't really heard so much for people

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.690 
hadn't really heard so much for people
taking<00:04:54.560> more<00:04:54.740> than<00:04:54.860> three<00:04:55.070> scoops<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.550> the

other stimulants are inside there it is

other stimulants are inside there it is
something<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.210> want<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.420> take<00:04:59.570> about<00:04:59.690> you

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
something you want to take about you

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.170 
something you want to take about you
know<00:05:00.410> an<00:05:00.680> hour<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.220> 30<00:05:01.580> minutes<00:05:01.820> before<00:05:01.940> you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
know an hour to 30 minutes before you

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.630 
know an hour to 30 minutes before you
workout<00:05:02.480> it's<00:05:03.380> not<00:05:03.530> gender-specific<00:05:04.010> matter

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
workout it's not gender-specific matter

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.280 
workout it's not gender-specific matter
women<00:05:04.790> can<00:05:05.000> take<00:05:05.150> it<00:05:05.300> but<00:05:05.450> women<00:05:05.990> generally

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
women can take it but women generally

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.720 
women can take it but women generally
have<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.560> lower<00:05:06.770> tolerance<00:05:07.100> i<00:05:07.460> would<00:05:07.580> say

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
have a lower tolerance i would say

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.560 
have a lower tolerance i would say
because<00:05:07.910> of<00:05:08.000> their<00:05:08.120> body<00:05:08.270> weight<00:05:08.420> to

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
because of their body weight to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.870 
because of their body weight to
stimulants<00:05:09.260> so<00:05:09.530> start<00:05:10.340> with<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.490> lower<00:05:10.640> dose

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
stimulants so start with a lower dose

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.580 
stimulants so start with a lower dose
and<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.330> half<00:05:11.480> a<00:05:11.510> scoop<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.110> see<00:05:12.260> how<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.410> do

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
and a half a scoop to see how you do

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.250 
and a half a scoop to see how you do
with<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:12.880> i<00:05:13.880> think<00:05:14.390> that's<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:15.110> about

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
with that i think that's just about

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.310 
with that i think that's just about

wrapped up they do have a lot of
questions<00:05:18.830> we<00:05:18.920> get<00:05:19.010> asked<00:05:19.250> Andy<00:05:19.490> stack<00:05:19.700> with

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
questions we get asked Andy stack with

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.210 
questions we get asked Andy stack with
the<00:05:19.940> Alpha<00:05:20.270> mean<00:05:20.420> it<00:05:20.630> can<00:05:21.410> but<00:05:21.800> not<00:05:22.010> at<00:05:22.070> the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
the Alpha mean it can but not at the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.680 
the Alpha mean it can but not at the
same<00:05:22.280> time<00:05:22.670> because<00:05:23.150> they<00:05:23.270> both<00:05:23.390> contain

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
same time because they both contain

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.390 
same time because they both contain
