00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.280 

and<00:01:10.790> I've<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> read<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.510> web<00:01:12.720> sounds<00:01:13.020> pretty

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and I've just read my web sounds pretty

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.850 
and I've just read my web sounds pretty
crap<00:01:13.620> didn't<00:01:14.130> exactly<00:01:14.700> pick<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.240> right

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
crap didn't exactly pick that up right

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
crap didn't exactly pick that up right
well<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.340> gives<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.820> most<00:01:18.270> disciples<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:20.540> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
well it gives the most disciples of the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.800 
well it gives the most disciples of the
light<00:01:21.750> functions<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.680> were<00:01:22.800> forced

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
light functions that's when were forced

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.030 
light functions that's when were forced
so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.140> quite<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.440> clear<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> think

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so it's not quite that clear I think

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400 
so it's not quite that clear I think
maybe<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.910> do<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.420> than<00:01:27.479> once<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.170> maybe

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
maybe if I do more than once then maybe

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.840 
maybe if I do more than once then maybe
there's<00:01:28.770> nothing<00:01:28.860> different<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.550> i'm<00:01:29.670> not

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there's nothing different as i'm not

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:45.279 
there's nothing different as i'm not
going<00:01:30.150> let<00:01:40.250> me<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:42.259> maybe<00:01:43.259> that'll<00:01:43.440> win<00:01:43.619> oh

that's a very important back again right

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.840 
that's a very important back again right
yeah<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.710> still<00:04:30.890> don't<00:04:31.100> know<00:04:31.130> why<00:04:31.310> doesn't<00:04:31.610> fit

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.740 
yeah I still don't know why doesn't fit
an<00:04:31.970> adult<00:04:32.300> really<00:04:33.020> not<00:04:33.800> fair<00:04:34.040> oh<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:35.450> pair

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
an adult really not fair oh this pair

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.670 
an adult really not fair oh this pair
for<00:04:35.960> children<00:04:36.500> hey<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.760> rehearse<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:41.680> yeah

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
for children hey we rehearse that yeah

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.490 
for children hey we rehearse that yeah
so<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.550> guess<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:44.510> could<00:04:44.690> be<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.930> reason<00:04:44.960> but

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
so I guess that could be the reason but

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.560 
so I guess that could be the reason but
it's<00:04:45.650> easily<00:04:45.950> modest<00:04:46.400> yes<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.910> can<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.240> get
