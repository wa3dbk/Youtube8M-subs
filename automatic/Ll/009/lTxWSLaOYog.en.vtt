00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.180
 dedicate to the care of the skin a 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.460
 cleaning by the tip of truth and this 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.830

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.869
 micro narrative of kilamba are with 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.730
 us that it is magnificent 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.380
 microdermabrasion that's the way 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
 feel at ease with our skin 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.340
 facial because the first thing we see there is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.309
 that we feel comfortable to feel 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.650
 relaxed and that's why we try to bring 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.900
 this exclusive treatment that the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.850
 facial microdermabrasion to the problem of 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.010
 reference so is the before and the after 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.379
 The first thing we do is make a 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.949
 diagnosis with the digital microscope 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:54.549
 there we see how badly we bring the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:58.690
 skin to the great soldier then after 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:01.809
 we put in a cream that helps us 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.059
 exfoliate to remove those dead cells to 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 those little black dots that are very 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.930
 annoying and that we try sometimes 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.520
 remove more horrible besides example 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.040
 worse is that we invite our skin and 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.890
 we leave marks then help us to 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.450
 activate the glycolic acid that here my 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 dear light ma will explain us the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 benefits of glycolic acid 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.960
 well we are the ones who are going to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.690

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 take care of our face not just with 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.770
 that we eat healthily but that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.200
 we have to have a help the acid 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 glycolic has a molecular chain that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 the molecules are very small and it makes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 that penetrates the second layer of the skin 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.729
