you<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.549> it's<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:37.000> video<00:03:37.209> game<00:03:37.419> so<00:03:37.900> you

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
you know it's a video game so you

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.309 
you know it's a video game so you
probably<00:03:38.409> got<00:03:38.889> a<00:03:38.919> balanced<00:03:39.549> um<00:03:39.790> somehow<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.169> I

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
probably got a balanced um somehow and I

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.110 
probably got a balanced um somehow and I
get<00:03:41.530> bit<00:03:41.739> freaked<00:03:42.069> out<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.479> see<00:03:43.479> what<00:03:43.629> I<00:03:43.659> mean<00:03:44.019> uh

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
get bit freaked out I see what I mean uh

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.349 
get bit freaked out I see what I mean uh
but<00:03:46.500> maybe<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.709> shotguns<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.699> don't<00:03:48.940> know<00:03:49.090> how

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
but maybe the shotguns I don't know how

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.349 
but maybe the shotguns I don't know how
they<00:03:49.389> can<00:03:49.840> tweak<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.349> think<00:03:51.209> shotguns<00:03:52.209> in

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
they can tweak that I think shotguns in

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.879 
they can tweak that I think shotguns in
general<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.199> video<00:03:53.560> games<00:03:53.919> they<00:03:54.699> just<00:03:54.940> need

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
general and video games they just need

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.210 
general and video games they just need
shorter<00:03:56.889> uh<00:03:57.690> magazines<00:03:58.690> like<00:03:59.079> less<00:03:59.590> ammo<00:03:59.949> or

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
shorter uh magazines like less ammo or

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.949 
shorter uh magazines like less ammo or
something<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.879> don't<00:04:00.940> know<00:04:01.209> ah<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:04.209> fire<00:04:04.540> rate

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
rate is kind of quick you know and you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.080 
rate is kind of quick you know and you
do<00:04:57.060> get<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.780> know<00:04:57.960> it's<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.410> one<00:04:58.650> hit<00:04:59.340> kill<00:04:59.370> if

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
you in the head so maybe the fire rate

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.439 
you in the head so maybe the fire rate
on<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.060> snipers<00:05:09.600> can<00:05:10.080> get<00:05:10.889> dummy<00:05:11.190> down<00:05:11.580> ah<00:05:14.449> the

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
on the snipers can get dummy down ah the

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.570 
on the snipers can get dummy down ah the
time<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.139> kill<00:05:16.350> we<00:05:16.590> talked<00:05:16.830> about<00:05:16.979> that<00:05:17.130> two

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
time to kill we talked about that two

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.000 
time to kill we talked about that two
shotguns<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:19.139> fire<00:05:19.410> rate<00:05:19.710> on<00:05:19.889> the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
shotguns and the fire rate on the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.850 
shotguns and the fire rate on the
snipers<00:05:21.289> my<00:05:22.289> main<00:05:22.880> grief<00:05:24.320> beef<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:26.720> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
snipers my main grief beef is the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.159 
snipers my main grief beef is the
launchers<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:29.190> think<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.150> still<00:05:30.630> think<00:05:31.050> you

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
launchers I think I still think you

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.430 
launchers I think I still think you
should<00:05:31.410> be<00:05:31.560> able<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.950> UM<00:05:32.720> equip<00:05:33.720> launchers<00:05:34.260> I

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
should be able to UM equip launchers I

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.360 
should be able to UM equip launchers I

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
rocket launcher because they're for

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.060 
rocket launcher because they're for
vehicles<00:06:26.970> that's<00:06:27.300> my<00:06:27.510> main<00:06:27.840> point<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.620> rocket

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
vehicles that's my main point the rocket

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.890 
vehicles that's my main point the rocket
launcher<00:06:29.099> is<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.729> equip<00:06:30.090> to<00:06:30.510> kill<00:06:30.750> the

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
launcher is to equip to kill the

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.050 
launcher is to equip to kill the
vehicles<00:06:31.349> now<00:06:31.710> if<00:06:31.889> I<00:06:32.010> shot<00:06:32.250> you<00:06:32.310> four<00:06:32.760> times

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
then I shoot my rocket yeah definitely

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.930 
then I shoot my rocket yeah definitely
it<00:06:37.260> should<00:06:37.440> kill<00:06:37.650> you<00:06:37.830> but<00:06:38.370> it<00:06:38.430> should<00:06:38.729> take

out the

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.860 
out the
launcher<00:06:40.230> should<00:06:40.470> be<00:06:40.710> able<00:06:40.830> to<00:06:41.040> take<00:06:41.310> out

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
launcher should be able to take out

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.380 
launcher should be able to take out
vehicles<00:06:42.870> even<00:06:43.320> if<00:06:43.470> you<00:06:43.620> don't<00:06:43.980> equip<00:06:44.550> RPGs

and let us equip stingers for the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.490 
and let us equip stingers for the
choppers<00:06:50.340> because<00:06:51.150> we<00:06:51.480> shouldn't<00:06:51.930> have<00:06:52.110> to<00:06:52.140> a
