00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.240
Ever since our species first looked up
at the sky, we've dreamed of reaching Mars.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.100
Back in 2029 that dream became real when the first humans set foot on the Red Planet.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.300
And in a few months a new group of
astronauts will make the journey.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.010
It's one of humanities most ambitious
undertakings: the direct result of a...

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.760
...decade long global space race, and of a
joint mission created to extend human...

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.700
...exploration to the farthest reaches of
our solar system.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.000
This is the story of Ares: our greatest
adventure.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.290
Behold! The Hermes,...

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.970
...the most complex and expensive machine ever built.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.300
We only built one, and it remains
harboured in low Earth orbit..

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.830
...between missions.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.790
Astronauts rely on shuttles to travel up
to Hermes, and from there they set...

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.500
...sail on a perfect controlled cruise.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
But make no mistake, this is...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
...no easy journey.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.000
The trip to Mars is as dangerous and
challenging as anything we've ever tried.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.100
The average journey checks in at a hundred and forty million miles, and throughout...

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.400
...the trip, Hermes and its crew...

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.200
...are bombarded by cosmic radiation that would irreversibly damaged their DNA,...

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.500
...if not for the ship's protection.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.830
And if that isn't enough, solar flares,...

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.570
...asteroids and meteoroids pose a
catastrophic threat to the mission.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.860
One major strike could leave Hermes
stranded in the hostile environment of...

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.030
...space with no hope of rescue.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.150
Provided everything goes as planned, the
Ares III crew will arrive in Martian...

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.100
...orbit one hundred and twenty-four days...

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.340
...later, ready to descend to the surface.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.569
Once on Mars they will spend a month in
a habitat designed to protect them from...

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.600
...low oxygen, high radiation, dust storms
and temperatures that can dip to one hundred degrees below zero.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.750
Despite those challenges, the
crew will thoroughly investigate the...

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.650
...planet's biological history and its
potential to cultivate and sustain life.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.239
Depending on what they learn, Star Talk
of the future may be posting to you from...

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.709
...a permanent self-sustaining Martian
colony, examining a new adventure that...

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.550
...will take us even deeper into the stars
above.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.290
Earth, a magnificent world to which we owe our creation no longer seems destined...

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.400
...to be our final resting place.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.400
Our adventure is just beginning.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.540
On behalf of Star Talk, we'd like to wish
the Ares III crew a safe journey.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.570
Godspeed Hermes, and as always keep
looking up.
