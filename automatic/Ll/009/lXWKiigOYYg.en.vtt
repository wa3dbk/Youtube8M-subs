because if you run this over some of
that<00:00:17.010> laminate<00:00:17.429> you're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.690> kicking

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that laminate you're going to be kicking

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.050 
that laminate you're going to be kicking
yourself<00:00:19.080> it'll<00:00:19.830> cost<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.280> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> money<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
lot of headache and heartache and so in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.510 
lot of headache and heartache and so in
our<00:00:24.840> project<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.710> were<00:00:25.800> working<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
our project that we were working on I

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.580 
our project that we were working on I
had<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> come<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.600> stop<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.199> very

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
had to come up with a stop to that very

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
had to come up with a stop to that very
reason<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.850> I<00:00:29.880> came<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.180> with<00:00:30.410> was<00:00:31.410> this

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
reason and what I came up with was this

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.250 
reason and what I came up with was this
nut<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> nut<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.239> has<00:00:33.449> a<00:00:33.480> groove<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
nut it's a nut that has a groove in it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.819 
nut it's a nut that has a groove in it
it's<00:00:35.250> quite<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.520> simple<00:00:35.910> solution<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.720> nut<00:00:37.590> with

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it's quite a simple solution a nut with

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's quite a simple solution a nut with
a<00:00:37.890> groove<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.850> cut<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> hacksaw<00:00:39.320> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a groove that I cut with a hacksaw and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.889 
a groove that I cut with a hacksaw and
it<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> set<00:00:41.790> screw<00:00:41.969> initially<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.510> started

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it has a set screw initially I started

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
it has a set screw initially I started
out<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> bolt<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
out with a bolt but you can see that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.369 
out with a bolt but you can see that
that<00:00:45.600> solution<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.620> bulky<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> clunky<00:00:48.379> right

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that solution is bulky and clunky right

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
that solution is bulky and clunky right
put<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.100> screw<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:51.410> there<00:00:52.460> boom<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
put this set screw in there boom it's

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
put this set screw in there boom it's
nice<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> small<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> wonderful<00:00:56.250> thing

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
nice and small and the wonderful thing

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
nice and small and the wonderful thing
about<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.879> whole<00:00:57.059> project<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.800> all<00:00:58.800> these

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
about this whole project if all these

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
about this whole project if all these
are<00:00:59.129> common<00:00:59.879> commonly<00:01:00.510> found<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
are common commonly found around the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.249 
are common commonly found around the
hardware<00:01:01.920> store<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.420> basically<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
hardware store this is basically just a

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.620 
hardware store this is basically just a
1/2<00:01:05.219> 13<00:01:05.729> nut<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.359> a<00:01:06.600> 1/2<00:01:06.929> 13<00:01:07.529> set<00:01:07.829> screw<00:01:08.630> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
1/2 13 nut and a 1/2 13 set screw so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
1/2 13 nut and a 1/2 13 set screw so
it's<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.350> won't<00:01:10.529> cost<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.979> much<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.850> than<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's it won't cost you much more than a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's it won't cost you much more than a
buck<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:13.139> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.590> good<00:01:14.490> thing<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:15.060> not

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
buck which is a good thing for not

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.949 
buck which is a good thing for not
ruining<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.439> countertop<00:01:17.630> ok<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.689> basically

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
ruining a countertop ok so basically

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.190 
ruining a countertop ok so basically
what<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> did<00:01:19.759> was<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.270> took<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.749> hacksaw

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
what I did was take I took the hacksaw

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.609 
what I did was take I took the hacksaw
and<00:01:22.469> started<00:01:23.189> cutting<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:24.029> the<00:01:24.090> corner<00:01:24.959> at<00:01:25.380> one

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and started cutting at the corner at one

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.349 
and started cutting at the corner at one
of<00:01:25.709> the<00:01:25.799> points<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.779> nut<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.209> can

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
of the points of the nut and as you can

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.149 
of the points of the nut and as you can
see<00:01:30.599> here<00:01:31.310> my<00:01:32.310> finished<00:01:32.729> product<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:34.099> it<00:01:35.099> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
see here my finished product that it is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.559 
see here my finished product that it is
offset<00:01:36.679> the<00:01:37.679> offset<00:01:38.249> is<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.209> that<00:01:39.359> you<00:01:39.419> have

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
offset the offset is so that you have

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.709 
offset the offset is so that you have
more<00:01:39.749> threads<00:01:40.189> starting<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.429> corner<00:01:41.880> so

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
more threads starting at the corner so

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.260 
more threads starting at the corner so
that<00:01:42.959> when<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:44.099> down<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.849> halfway

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that when you go down about halfway

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.599 
that when you go down about halfway
you'll<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> flat<00:01:46.770> surface<00:01:47.099> that<00:01:47.340> you'll

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
you'll have a flat surface that you'll

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.599 
you'll have a flat surface that you'll
be<00:01:47.729> able<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.969> put<00:01:48.090> against<00:01:48.419> your<00:01:48.569> board<00:01:49.609> so

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
be able to put against your board so

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.959 
be able to put against your board so
then<00:01:50.880> basically<00:01:51.209> what<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
then basically what you

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.749 
then basically what you
you're<00:01:52.869> almost<00:01:53.049> ready<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.560> install<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.280> use

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
you're almost ready to install it I use

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.239 
you're almost ready to install it I use
five<00:01:55.090> threads<00:01:55.390> on<00:01:55.569> my<00:01:55.689> hacksaw<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.069> I<00:01:57.100> think

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
five threads on my hacksaw so I think

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.719 
five threads on my hacksaw so I think
that<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.030> slot<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.280> fact<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.609> I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
that the slot that that the fact that I

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.539 
that the slot that that the fact that I
used<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:01.270> find<00:02:02.079> threads<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.710> wide<00:02:02.950> slot<00:02:03.369> is

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
used to find threads is wide slot is

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.419 
used to find threads is wide slot is
just<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.819> little<00:02:04.060> narrow<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:06.009> what<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.219> have<00:02:06.340> to

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
just a little narrow so what I have to

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.679 
just a little narrow so what I have to
do<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.579> I'd<00:02:06.729> go<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.119> with<00:02:07.299> some<00:02:07.329> sandpaper

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
do is I'd go in with some sandpaper

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.050 
do is I'd go in with some sandpaper
actually<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.289> took<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.500> strip<00:02:09.310> sander<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
actually I took the strip sander and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.670 
actually I took the strip sander and
just<00:02:10.299> kind<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.629> widen<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:11.379> because<00:02:11.560> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
just kind of widen it out because I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.369 
just kind of widen it out because I
didn't<00:02:11.860> want<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.069> ruin<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.879> burr<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.170> put

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
didn't want to ruin the burr that I put

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.900 
didn't want to ruin the burr that I put
on<00:02:14.410> my<00:02:15.069> cabinet<00:02:15.459> scraper<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:16.150> worked<00:02:17.140> hard<00:02:17.530> on

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
on my cabinet scraper I worked hard on

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.680 
on my cabinet scraper I worked hard on
to<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:19.900> putting<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.690> basically

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
to what I'm putting this on so basically

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330 
to what I'm putting this on so basically
you<00:02:22.989> set<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> set<00:02:23.500> screw<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:23.769> make<00:02:24.129> sure<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
you set the set screw and make sure it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
you set the set screw and make sure it
doesn't<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:24.700> over<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.720> slide<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.709> up<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:28.690> this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
doesn't go over and slide it up at this

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.710 
doesn't go over and slide it up at this
point<00:02:29.260> what<00:02:29.470> you'll<00:02:29.590> need<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.420> is

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
point what you'll need to do and this is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390 
point what you'll need to do and this is
all<00:02:32.049> common<00:02:32.290> sense<00:02:32.650> at<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.890> point<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
all common sense at this point in the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.869 
all common sense at this point in the
game<00:02:33.579> but<00:02:34.120> basically<00:02:34.599> set<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
game but basically set this to the

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.240 
game but basically set this to the
thickness<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.420> your<00:02:37.480> molding<00:02:37.959> let's<00:02:38.920> let's

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
thickness of your molding let's let's

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.979 
thickness of your molding let's let's
say<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:40.269> have<00:02:40.420> our<00:02:40.450> lamb<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.959> over<00:02:41.230> here<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.989> we
