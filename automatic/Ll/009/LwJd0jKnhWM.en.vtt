00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.550
 welcome everyone to our channel 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.100
 in this video i will show how to do 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.290
 feeder mounting using here 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.939
 such a counter wrapper for 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.980
 making this installation to us 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.040
 you will need it yourself 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.939
 feeder feeder 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.210
 Here is such a plastic bead 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.579
 swivel 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.870
 and accordingly a leash with a hook 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.610
 this installation can be knit as we 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.460
 hinges also on braided cord 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.370
 that is all the same some year 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 on the main line that is cutting 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.410
 which is wound on the spool of our coil 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.960
 and some groups of it on a separate 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.539
 segment of line or cord and then this 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.410
 assembly connect with the main line with 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.039
 using the clasp I'll be in this video 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.480
 knit this montage on mono fishing line and so 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.150
 First we take the main line and 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
 counteractifier 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.900
 counteractifier is small 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.080
 a piece of plastic tubules are 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.960
 different lengths and this duct and gold 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.230
 so that one edge is obtained 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.810
 shorter and different to the length and on the bend 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.940
 there is such a metal 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.730
 petechka which is fixed 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.590
 fasteners and now our task is from 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.880
 stretch the line through the middle 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.280
 counteractor 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 line is inserted from the side which 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820
 in short 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:49.130
 Here is the fishing line seemed on the reverse side 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.780
 we get it and put a bead here after 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.000
 beads 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 we knot the clinch knot of our circle 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.140
 all swivel we tied now on here 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 this one 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:25.690
 fastener dressing trough close now 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.680
 and now we are left with this 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.280
 second edge igor . 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.530
 who is free to tie our leash with 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.819
 crochet and leash will tie 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.819
 connecting loop to loop 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.859
 delaying 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.719
 all of our tooling is fully prepared and 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.709
 now based on our own 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.139
 observations 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.959
 I want to point out a few advantages and 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.540
 cons of this snap start with the pros 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.760
 Well, firstly this snap is very 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.769
 sensitive to bite because 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.109
 here the main line is free 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.810
 through counteractifier and as soon as 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.389
 the fish takes our bait right away 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.069
 fulfills the tip of the feeder rod 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.579
 and it gives you the opportunity to do 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.989
 correct and timely hooking 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.329
 also absolutely no sense of weight 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.939
 feeders and therefore can not immediately 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.219
 suspect something amiss but these 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.310
 well-known 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.349
 online montages and asymmetric loop 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.840
 and here is the next advantage of mounting 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.239
 so counterclicator im making it 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.579
 unique uniqueness lies in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.459
 that such installation is free 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.780
 catch in places where 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.299
 fishing line and cords are exposed very 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.829
 heavy wear it for example places where 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.530
 many stones m but shells and the 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.900
 like of the minuses can only be noted 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.849
 what if this snap for example 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.340
 compare pattern sharp then it seems 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.709
 a little cumbersome which in turn 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.930
 negatively affects the casting distance a 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.540
 also on the stability of the feeders when fishing 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.280
 on fast going thanks for your attention 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.560
 subscribe to our channel see 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.560
 a lot of interesting video to new meetings
