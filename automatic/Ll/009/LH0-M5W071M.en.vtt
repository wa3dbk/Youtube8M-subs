00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 good talking about playing we were 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.700
 present invited by Mr. Marin and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.830
 the association of basketball players 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 of Argentina in the game of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 stars of the national basketball league 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 'being read at the moon park about 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.960
 a few days ago we were there not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 just enjoying the show that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 It was huge both days but 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.350
 we were also able to share a little with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.760
 the characters that were there present 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.380
 for example I am many giving with the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 pichi bell that would come to be a thing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.969
 as well as michael jordan argentino 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 we were good in the end you want to see the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.719
 first part of what was the game of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.070
 the stars of the national league of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.070
 basketball stay around then 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:01:23.150
 [Music] 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.830
 and did not see how you saw the good event very 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.750
 well the truth that back to the moon park 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.250
 after many years and with a 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.180
 really important production with 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.729
 many things that contributed to 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 show does not make the truth that it 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.030
 have seen differently than the last years 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.010
 and beyond what for example what 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.390
 economic that sometimes you can be 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.220
 make them bring some more characters 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.530
 to the pets as you said as you see in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.110
 general the level of basketball in this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.000
 era was very different from my time not 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.780
 because now there is an exodus of the best 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.780
 players and that's hard to bear 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.210
 for internal competition they have changed 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.830
 the times now the teams cost 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.230
 maintain a state plastic 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.510
 and the best one in my time was maybe 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.310
 easier then it looked a lot 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 rivalry that today's best year to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.210
 year are changing but good is the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.940
 reality and you have to adapt there are many 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.980
 young players with a future 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.300
 promising that you have to give it the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.800
 opportunity are developing metra 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.480
 league after I entered the competition 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.850
 international and good so that what 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.010
 we have a lot of time and but there are good 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.450
 times the exodus is inevitable and the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.820
 best teams in the world many times 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.930
 they are nourished by Argentine players who 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.500
 have left a good image in the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.750
 outside and that makes many teams 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.520
 see and look at our league and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.770
 simple in our player if you could 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.080
 choose I'll like to be a few years 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.520
 later I'm going to play a little 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 then I mean this time that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.760
 maybe basketball has had another 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 international response below 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 Argentina I do not really enjoy my time 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.489
 Not really 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.310
 I never really got to thinking about what 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.340
 like several years later because also 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.170
 it happened to me live very the mention or not no 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.299
 because I had to live a time where 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.709
 there were other important players a lot 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.269
 bigger than me who did not touch them 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.069
 live another time so I am very 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.060
 happy with him because he touched me we're going to 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.040
 have to prepare for the year that 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.450
 come again we will try to win it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.269
 again but they did not win us the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.159
 players did not win the player who was 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.410
 better of lobÃ³n if we did not have the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:29.710
 champions 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:32.050
 [Music] 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.090
 and well it's on the other side this time 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.430
 the other side I like seen a little 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.700
 element well tell me you resist I liked it 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.230
 I liked had had the good vibes 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.580
 players missed a lot here what 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.040
 It is important that players engage 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.380
 that people feel comfortable the stadium 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.410
 going up is the bet was good 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.940
 I do 15 or 18 that I'm accompanying the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.710
 action of players and always the first 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.180
 day is the one that lets let's say things 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.370
 to improve for the second one that is the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.780
 more important then tell me a little 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.270
 the second what do you expect for tomorrow and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.800
 many things but it seems to me that 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.070
 tribute to the 50 champions can be 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.920
 very emotional this one I hope it comes more 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.690
 public than the one that came today building 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.120
 when the main game is to say 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.180
 leaving should be with a clear image is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.440
 that 's how it is posed by voice and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.370
 surely the game against the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.050
 foreigners will be fine 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.300
 today the foreigners in the overturned 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.800
 they showed many things this good the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.900
 definition of dunk tournament with with 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.340
 finally that is tremendous bus too 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.139
 it's fine so I think it's going to 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.060
 to be 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.509
 his triple scola got what 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.090
 you expected if it's not a triple shot or 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.580
 I think it's doing 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.960
 the truth that is out there was for 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.879
 below what I expected but 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.550
 It is not that Luis is a specialist 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.400
 in shooting triples and that more against the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.560
 watch not that that's more difficult now 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.689
 standing faithfully a match is different and 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.240
 17 or two but we're going to have to 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.069
 run from car to car and there is a clock 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.199
 that is hurrying you is more difficult 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:02.110
 pity that he can not play for the subject 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.490
 of the nba agreements if it would not be 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.949
 good to see him in a little while in action to 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.229
 louis that since his imprint is 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.849
 completely different from the rest of the 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.340
 players so but obama is already going to be 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.279
 very good all the last minute you 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.170

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:23.850
