00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
happy with the paint because it's a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.080 
happy with the paint because it's a
little<00:02:23.300> out<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> scale<00:02:23.930> with<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.820> metal<00:02:25.820> flake

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
in it and it's not the exact color I

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.699 
in it and it's not the exact color I
thought<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.760> was<00:02:28.940> from<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.600> can<00:02:29.870> but<00:02:30.320> I<00:02:30.470> still

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.800 
thought it was from the can but I still
think<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.950> looks<00:02:31.160> good<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.850> it's<00:02:32.540> close

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
think it looks good and it's close

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.520 
think it looks good and it's close
enough<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:34.070> think<00:02:34.550> gotta<00:02:34.820> work<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.290> top

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
enough so I think gotta work the top

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.590 
enough so I think gotta work the top
here<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:38.360> like<00:02:38.570> an<00:02:39.170> opening<00:02:40.040> top<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.270> cut

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
here is like an opening top and I cut

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.930 
here is like an opening top and I cut
out<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> piece<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.470> I'll<00:02:43.010> open<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.640> here

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
out the piece and I'll open that here

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.500 
out the piece and I'll open that here
and<00:02:44.209> show<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:47.200> what<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.320> looks<00:02:48.350> like<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.510> just

and show you what it looks like I just
made<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.080> can<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:51.440> take<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.769> off<00:02:51.920> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
it's kind of hard to see because of the

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.270 
it's kind of hard to see because of the
lighting<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.030> here<00:03:17.060> but<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.110> seats<00:03:18.440> there's

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
people put those on their cars to

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.640 
people put those on their cars to
basically<00:03:38.600> say<00:03:38.840> they're<00:03:39.049> from<00:03:39.079> Great<00:03:39.620> Britain

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650

basically say they're from Great Britain
my<00:03:40.489> dad<00:03:40.700> has<00:03:40.970> won't<00:03:41.209> had<00:03:41.420> one<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.690> his<00:03:41.840> car

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
my dad has won't had one on his car

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.509 
my dad has won't had one on his car
previously<00:03:42.799> because<00:03:42.980> that's<00:03:43.250> where<00:03:43.400> he's

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
previously because that's where he's

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.280 
previously because that's where he's
from<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.690> thought<00:03:44.840> it'd<00:03:44.959> be<00:03:45.019> kind<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.230> cool

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
from so I thought it'd be kind of cool

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.509 
from so I thought it'd be kind of cool
to<00:03:45.440> put<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.799> on<00:03:45.860> there<00:03:46.190> for<00:03:47.150> him<00:03:47.420> um<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:49.370> yeah

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
to put that on there for him um but yeah

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.280 
to put that on there for him um but yeah
that's<00:03:49.820> pretty<00:03:50.150> much<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:52.570> um

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.580 

I<00:03:56.409> think<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.040> turned<00:03:57.310> out<00:03:57.489> really<00:03:57.549> good<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
I think it turned out really good and I

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.649 
I think it turned out really good and I
think<00:03:59.620> he's<00:04:00.519> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.879> really<00:04:01.150> happy<00:04:01.329> with

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
think he's going to be really happy with

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.309 
think he's going to be really happy with
it<00:04:01.689> so<00:04:03.299> again<00:04:04.299> that's<00:04:04.569> just<00:04:04.870> i'll<00:04:05.079> give<00:04:05.230> you

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
it so again that's just i'll give you

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.610 
it so again that's just i'll give you
another<00:04:05.500> look<00:04:05.769> at<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> car<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:08.109> side<00:04:08.560> view

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
another look at the car the side view

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.149 
another look at the car the side view
the<00:04:11.620> front<00:04:12.040> view<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:14.290> there's<00:04:14.650> James

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
the front view and then there's James

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.159 
the front view and then there's James
Bond<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.849> odd<00:04:16.060> job<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.900> pretty<00:04:20.109> much

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
Bond and odd job so that's pretty much

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.620 
Bond and odd job so that's pretty much
it<00:04:21.690> I'll<00:04:22.690> show<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.960> bottom<00:04:26.500> two<00:04:27.479> it's<00:04:28.479> a

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it I'll show you the bottom two it's a

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.510 
it I'll show you the bottom two it's a
curbside<00:04:29.199> model<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.080> doesn't<00:04:32.680> really<00:04:33.009> have

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
curbside model so it doesn't really have

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.230 
curbside model so it doesn't really have
a<00:04:34.380> whole<00:04:35.380> lot<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:36.330> detail<00:04:37.330> on<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.780> bottom<00:04:39.240> but

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
a whole lot of detail on the bottom but

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.480 
a whole lot of detail on the bottom but
there's<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.900> bottom<00:04:43.830> because<00:04:44.830> then<00:04:45.310> there's

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
there's the bottom because then there's

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.430 
there's the bottom because then there's
of<00:04:45.580> course<00:04:45.610> there's<00:04:45.910> no<00:04:46.060> motor<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:50.169> turned

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
of course there's no motor so it turned

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.499 
of course there's no motor so it turned
out<00:04:50.560> okay<00:04:50.949> on<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.460> bottom<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.030> wish<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.360> add<00:04:52.479> a
