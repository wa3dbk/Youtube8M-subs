now<00:00:07.770> these<00:00:07.919> aren't<00:00:08.130> totally<00:00:08.400> torqued<00:00:08.849> down

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
now these aren't totally torqued down

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.299 
now these aren't totally torqued down
yet<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.540> should<00:00:09.750> feel<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.380> slight<00:00:10.800> bit<00:00:11.280> of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
yet but you should feel a slight bit of

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.680 
yet but you should feel a slight bit of
backlash<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.240> here<00:00:15.080> just<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.410> four<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
backlash in here just about four of

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.420 
backlash in here just about four of
8,000th<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.170> end<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.560> barely<00:00:19.890> movement

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
8,000th in the end them barely movement

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.370 
8,000th in the end them barely movement
of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> ring<00:00:20.760> gear<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.150> back<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.600> forth<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
of the ring gear just back and forth it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.689 
of the ring gear just back and forth it
shouldn't<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.800> super<00:00:23.160> tight<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:23.580> it's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shouldn't be super tight where it's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
shouldn't be super tight where it's
locked<00:00:23.910> up<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:24.750> should<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
locked up but there should be just a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.599 
locked up but there should be just a
little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> backlash<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.430> looks

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
little bit of backlash and that looks

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.009 
little bit of backlash and that looks
like<00:00:26.760> about<00:00:27.000> four<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> eight<00:00:27.390> thousands

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
like about four to eight thousands

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:54.460 
like about four to eight thousands
that's<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.039> need

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.230 

and<00:00:55.470> we'll<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> torque<00:00:56.160> wrench<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
and we'll take a torque wrench and

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.910 
and we'll take a torque wrench and
tighten<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.720> bolts<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.350> 105

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
tighten these bolts up to 105

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
tighten these bolts up to 105
foot-pounds<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> steps<00:01:00.060> of<00:01:00.240> three<00:01:00.540> I've<00:01:01.080> got

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
foot-pounds in steps of three I've got

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.480 
foot-pounds in steps of three I've got
the<00:01:01.380> torque<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.920> torque<00:01:02.130> wrench<00:01:02.310> set

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
the torque we have the torque wrench set

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:15.889 
the torque we have the torque wrench set
on<00:01:02.640> thirty<00:01:02.850> foot<00:01:03.090> pounds<00:01:03.450> right<00:01:03.600> now

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.649 

there's<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:16.770> step<00:01:17.329> now<00:01:18.329> set<00:01:18.630> your

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
there's the first step now set your

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.639 
there's the first step now set your
torque<00:01:19.020> wrench<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:21.000> 80<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> second

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
torque wrench on about 80 for the second

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:41.870 
torque wrench on about 80 for the second
step

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.860 

and<00:01:42.880> by<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.060> way<00:01:43.270> there's<00:01:43.480> no<00:01:43.660> need<00:01:43.840> for

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
and by the way there's no need for

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.410 
and by the way there's no need for
Loctite<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.500> on<00:01:44.800> these<00:01:45.070> caps<00:01:46.000> right<00:01:46.300> here<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
Loctite on on these caps right here just

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.210 
Loctite on on these caps right here just
on<00:01:49.600> your<00:01:49.690> ring<00:01:49.900> gear

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.650 

and<00:01:57.510> adjust<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:58.900> your<00:01:59.110> last<00:01:59.320> step
