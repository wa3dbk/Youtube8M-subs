negative attitude towards the material

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.780 
negative attitude towards the material
and<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.350> don't<00:05:22.530> think<00:05:22.770> there<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.220> in

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
and I don't think there is that in

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.909 
and I don't think there is that in
Frank's<00:05:24.390> attitude<00:05:24.810> towards<00:05:25.169> do<00:05:25.350> up<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.710> think

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
Frank's attitude towards do up I think

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.380 
Frank's attitude towards do up I think
he<00:05:25.979> completely<00:05:26.190> adored<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.180> totally

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
he completely adored it and totally

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.770 
he completely adored it and totally
embraced<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.320> silly<00:05:29.010> aspects<00:05:29.640> as<00:05:29.940> something

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
embraced in silly aspects as something

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.170 
embraced in silly aspects as something
that<00:05:30.810> he<00:05:31.080> he<00:05:31.800> loved<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.669> wanted<00:05:32.790> other<00:05:33.090> people

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
that he he loved and wanted other people

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.650 
that he he loved and wanted other people
to<00:05:33.450> love<00:05:33.690> as<00:05:33.870> well<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:35.580> was<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.940> music<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.360> his

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
to love as well it was the music of his

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.219 
to love as well it was the music of his
youth<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:37.610> think<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:39.000> so<00:05:39.360> many<00:05:39.600> people<00:05:40.080> who

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
youth I think like so many people who

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.620 
youth I think like so many people who
were<00:05:40.350> fans<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.919> do<00:05:41.160> up<00:05:41.400> there's<00:05:42.060> something

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
were fans of do up there's something

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.290 
were fans of do up there's something
about<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.140> the<00:05:43.590> music<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:44.280> really<00:05:44.490> speaks<00:05:45.060> of

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
about it the music that really speaks of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.930 
about it the music that really speaks of
sort<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.660> being<00:05:45.930> young<00:05:46.320> sort<00:05:47.250> of<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.490> desire

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
sort of being young sort of the desire

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.250 
sort of being young sort of the desire
and<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.360> yearning<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:50.640> know<00:05:50.760> of<00:05:51.540> being<00:05:52.169> a

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
and the yearning of you know of being a

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.180 
and the yearning of you know of being a
young<00:05:52.550> person<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:54.660> I<00:05:55.080> think<00:05:55.500> he<00:05:55.740> connected

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
young person and I think he connected

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.100 
young person and I think he connected
with<00:05:56.250> that<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.820> mean<00:05:57.300> he<00:05:57.450> was<00:05:57.570> somebody<00:05:57.990> that

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
with that I mean he was somebody that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.810 
with that I mean he was somebody that
got<00:05:58.440> into<00:05:58.620> this<00:05:58.710> really<00:05:58.950> sophisticated<00:05:59.130> kind

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
got into this really sophisticated kind

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.520 
got into this really sophisticated kind
of<00:05:59.910> music<00:06:00.300> but<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:00.720> think<00:06:01.020> he<00:06:01.140> probably<00:06:01.320> had

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
of music but I think he probably had

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.230 
of music but I think he probably had
this<00:06:01.770> sort<00:06:01.979> of<00:06:02.070> sentimental<00:06:02.610> side<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.120> way

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
this sort of sentimental side in the way

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.670 
this sort of sentimental side in the way
and<00:06:03.479> he<00:06:03.540> heard<00:06:03.720> that<00:06:03.900> music<00:06:04.050> and<00:06:04.380> it<00:06:04.470> really

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
and he heard that music and it really

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.080 
and he heard that music and it really
touched<00:06:04.919> something<00:06:05.190> inside<00:06:05.640> of<00:06:05.820> him<00:06:05.910> you<00:06:06.030> know

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
touched something inside of him you know

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.740
