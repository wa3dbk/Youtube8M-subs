00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and I think I'm not sure if all of them

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
and I think I'm not sure if all of them
are<00:00:46.920> free<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> free<00:00:48.690> and

are free but one of them is free and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.229 
are free but one of them is free and
then<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.760> add<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> bass<00:00:51.210> drum

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
then if you want you can add a bass drum
port<00:00:51.809> protector<00:00:52.969> or<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> mic<00:00:54.239> port<00:00:54.510> protector

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and that's $14 or you could do it after

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
and that's $14 or you could do it after
the<00:00:59.250> fact<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.609> guess<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.660> him<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.930> ahead

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the fact I guess I just had him go ahead

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.649 
the fact I guess I just had him go ahead
and<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> same<00:01:02.219> time<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.659> basically

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and do it at the same time so basically

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
and do it at the same time so basically
