the first of two different models they
made<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:07.020> can<00:00:07.170> tell<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.680> first

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
made you can tell that it's the first

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.440 
made you can tell that it's the first
one<00:00:08.040> because<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> second<00:00:08.700> one<00:00:08.790> has<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> plastic

it's a nice little SLR
I<00:00:19.050> shouldn't<00:00:19.650> say<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.130> actually

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I shouldn't say little it's actually

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.890 
I shouldn't say little it's actually
rather<00:00:20.490> big<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.880> hefty<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.750> pretty

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
rather big and hefty but it's pretty

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
second it also has a couple of nicer

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
second it also has a couple of nicer
features<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.380> canons

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
features that you don't see on canons

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.459 
features that you don't see on canons
newer<00:00:35.130> SLR<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> AE<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> AE<00:00:37.260> 1

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
newer SLR is like the AE one and AE 1

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.580 
newer SLR is like the AE one and AE 1
program<00:00:37.829> such<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> mirror<00:00:38.550> lock-up

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
program such as a mirror lock-up

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.750 
program such as a mirror lock-up
but<00:00:40.590> let's<00:00:40.920> talk<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> load<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
but let's talk about how to load it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
but let's talk about how to load it
today<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.570> camera<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> bit

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
today so this camera is actually a bit

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
today so this camera is actually a bit
easier<00:00:44.010> than<00:00:44.370> most<00:00:44.670> Canon<00:00:45.059> SLRs<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
easier than most Canon SLRs and that's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
easier than most Canon SLRs and that's
because<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> quick<00:00:46.379> load<00:00:46.559> system<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because of the quick load system can it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
because of the quick load system can it
actually<00:00:47.969> implemented<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> few

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
actually implemented this on a few

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
actually implemented this on a few
different<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.590> their<00:00:49.710> cameras<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> late

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
different of their cameras in the late

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
different of their cameras in the late
60s<00:00:51.360> early<00:00:51.449> 70s<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.199> quite<00:00:53.070> honestly<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
60s early 70s and quite honestly it's a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.979 
60s early 70s and quite honestly it's a
great<00:00:53.820> system<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.420> sure<00:00:54.570> why<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.750> didn't

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
great system I'm not sure why it didn't

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
great system I'm not sure why it didn't
catch<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.579> any<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:57.199> or<00:00:58.199> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
catch on but just like any other or just

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.950 
catch on but just like any other or just
like<00:00:58.710> most<00:00:58.920> other<00:00:59.070> cameras<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.520> should<00:00:59.640> say

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
like most other cameras I should say

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.700 
like most other cameras I should say
totally<00:01:00.960> cam<00:01:01.109> we're<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> start<00:01:01.620> by

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
totally cam we're going to start by

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.399 
totally cam we're going to start by
turning<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:02.390> pulling<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.140> film

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
turning it over pulling up on the film

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
turning it over pulling up on the film
rewind<00:01:04.619> lever<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.390> popping<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
rewind lever here and popping it and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.890 
rewind lever here and popping it and
that'll<00:01:07.350> pop<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> open<00:01:08.240> now<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.720> here

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that'll pop it open now you can see here

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.539 
that'll pop it open now you can see here
that<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> does<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that it does look on the back like just

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
that it does look on the back like just
any<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:11.820> camera<00:01:12.439> except<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
any other camera except it has this

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.060 
any other camera except it has this
metal<00:01:14.130> flap<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
metal flap right here and that is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
metal flap right here and that is
actually<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> quickload<00:01:17.790> system<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> can

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
actually the quickload system so you can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
actually the quickload system so you can
see<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> open<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> stays<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.850> place<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
see when I open it it stays in place and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.830 
see when I open it it stays in place and
then<00:01:21.689> folds<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.570> start

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
then folds out of the way so to start

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780 
then folds out of the way so to start
we're<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> take<00:01:25.740> our<00:01:25.920> roll<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> 35

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
we're going to take our roll of 35

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.789 
we're going to take our roll of 35
millimeter<00:01:27.180> film<00:01:28.070> put<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> upside<00:01:29.549> down<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.970> I

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
millimeter film put it upside down or I

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
millimeter film put it upside down or I
suppose<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.040> upside-down<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.180> want

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
suppose is not upside-down but you want

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
suppose is not upside-down but you want
the<00:01:33.570> film<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.500> right<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> leader<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the film on the right with the leader on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.719 
the film on the right with the leader on
the<00:01:36.450> bottom<00:01:37.189> you're<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> set<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the bottom you're going to set it in

it goes exactly the same do the same

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.700 
it goes exactly the same do the same
thing<00:03:14.280> we're<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.940> advance<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.710> few

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
thing we're going to advance a few

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.400 
thing we're going to advance a few
frames<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.900> now<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> Canon<00:03:20.880> nql<00:03:21.330> 17<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
frames and now with the Canon nql 17 it

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.620 
frames and now with the Canon nql 17 it
has<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.980> window<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.400> back<00:03:23.630> and

has this little window on the back and
now<00:03:24.780> what<00:03:24.989> that'll<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.440> when<00:03:26.190> we're

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
now what that'll do is when we're

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.890 
now what that'll do is when we're
advancing<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.970> film<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.420> film<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.780> in

advancing the film and the film is in
there<00:03:28.020> properly<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.739> tells<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.790> makes

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
there properly it tells you and it makes

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.150 
there properly it tells you and it makes

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
sure that it works now you can see here

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.510 
sure that it works now you can see here
just<00:03:32.400> how<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.760> works<00:03:33.020> you<00:03:34.020> can<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.680> I

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
just how that works you can see as I

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.360 
just how that works you can see as I
advance<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.180> film<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.650> little<00:03:37.860> window<00:03:38.070> so

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
advance the film the little window so
