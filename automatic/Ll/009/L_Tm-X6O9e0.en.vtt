00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.490 

next<00:00:39.149> we're<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> pour<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.290> our

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
next we're going to pour some of our

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369 
next we're going to pour some of our
fruit<00:00:40.800> juice<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.910> Cup<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.230> fill

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
fruit juice into this Cup but don't fill

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
fruit juice into this Cup but don't fill
it<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> ways<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:44.969> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it up all the ways because when you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
it up all the ways because when you
freeze<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> will<00:00:45.870> expand

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
freeze it it will expand

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:59.029 
freeze it it will expand
okay<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.719> pour<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> was

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
okay so let's pour it so that was

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.840 
okay so let's pour it so that was
probably<00:00:59.190> too<00:00:59.489> much<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.809> smack

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
probably too much but I can take smack

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
probably too much but I can take smack
so<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> fill<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> container<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> like

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so if you fill the container up to like

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.490 
so if you fill the container up to like
3/4<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.519> should<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.000> good<00:01:06.500> alright

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
3/4 that should probably be good alright

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
3/4 that should probably be good alright
so<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so now we're going to put this in the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000 
so now we're going to put this in the
freezer<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:10.140> two<00:01:10.560> hours

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
freezer for about two hours

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:27.400 
freezer for about two hours
and<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> should<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.700> frozen<00:01:11.880> by<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.990 

all<00:01:28.410> right<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.830> we'll<00:01:29.100> let<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.910> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
