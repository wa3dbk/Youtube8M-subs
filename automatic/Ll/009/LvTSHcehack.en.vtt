00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.819 
you can't queue up commands and you can
only<00:01:54.549> map<00:01:54.789> one<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.359> hotkey<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:56.500> makes<00:01:56.740> it

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
only map one to a hotkey this makes it

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.319 
only map one to a hotkey this makes it
so<00:01:56.979> there's<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.249> lot<00:01:57.429> of<00:01:57.460> causing<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.149> game

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
so there's a lot of causing the game

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.109 
so there's a lot of causing the game
using<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.289> power<00:01:59.469> unpause<00:02:00.189> in<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.429> game<00:02:00.609> going

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
using a power unpause in the game going

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.060 
using a power unpause in the game going
back<00:02:01.359> into<00:02:01.630> action<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.530> kind<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.859> makes

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
back into action and it kind of makes

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.440 
back into action and it kind of makes
the<00:02:03.189> game<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.399> little<00:02:03.579> bit<00:02:03.700> choppy<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.149> breaks

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the game a little bit choppy and breaks

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.300 
the game a little bit choppy and breaks
up<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.630> action<00:02:05.079> there's<00:02:05.829> also<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.039> lack<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
up the action there's also a lack of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980 
up the action there's also a lack of
good<00:02:06.579> tutorials<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.210> game<00:02:07.359> and<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.810> you'll

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
good tutorials in the game and so you'll

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.270 
good tutorials in the game and so you'll
actually<00:02:08.170> play<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.649> game<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:08.830> roughly<00:02:09.130> about

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
actually play the game for roughly about

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.040 
actually play the game for roughly about
five<00:02:09.700> hours<00:02:09.729> before<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.390> really<00:02:10.630> understand

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
five hours before you really understand

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.570 
five hours before you really understand
the<00:02:11.170> combat<00:02:11.560> system<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.100> into<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.460> and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the combat system and get into it and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.730 
the combat system and get into it and
this<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.300> make<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.450> very<00:02:13.740> frustrating

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
this can make it very frustrating

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.620 
this can make it very frustrating
especially<00:02:15.280> since<00:02:15.819> there's<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.150> good<00:02:16.360> safe

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
especially since there's not a good safe

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.390 
especially since there's not a good safe
system<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.140> game<00:02:17.350> there's<00:02:17.830> an<00:02:17.980> autosave

the<00:02:20.170> autosave<00:02:20.530> feature<00:02:20.560> doesn't<00:02:21.069> save<00:02:21.340> nearly

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the autosave feature doesn't save nearly

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.470 
the autosave feature doesn't save nearly
enough<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.120> you'll<00:02:22.210> find<00:02:22.390> yourself

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
enough and you'll find yourself
