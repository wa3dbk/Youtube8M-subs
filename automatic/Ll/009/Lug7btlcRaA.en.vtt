in<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> bottom<00:00:42.149> corner<00:00:43.219> moving<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
in the bottom corner moving on to the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
in the bottom corner moving on to the
plants<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.719> they've<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
plants as you can see they've come on so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
plants as you can see they've come on so
much<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.430> within<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.660> week<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> half

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
much more within first week and a half

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.790 
much more within first week and a half
two<00:00:49.800> weeks<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.539> think<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> pile<00:00:52.680> up

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
two weeks and I think there's a pile up

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
two weeks and I think there's a pile up
for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> lotuses<00:00:53.550> ages<00:00:53.940> ago<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.270> couldn't

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
for the lotuses ages ago and I couldn't

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
for the lotuses ages ago and I couldn't
my<00:00:54.840> didn't<00:00:55.079> mark<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.710> can't<00:00:55.920> remember

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
my didn't mark them so I can't remember

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.479 
my didn't mark them so I can't remember
which<00:00:56.250> ones<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.670> are<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.370> this

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
which ones they are so I thought this

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
which ones they are so I thought this
was<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> yellow<00:00:59.969> seven<00:01:00.890> but<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.010> leave

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
was a yellow seven but they leave

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
was a yellow seven but they leave
slightly<00:01:03.000> leaf<00:01:03.180> size<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.809> too<00:01:03.989> sure<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
slightly leaf size I'm not too sure it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310 
slightly leaf size I'm not too sure it
could<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> Trinidad<00:01:05.659> we<00:01:06.659> showed<00:01:06.900> us<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
could be the Trinidad we showed us up to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.940 
could be the Trinidad we showed us up to
wait<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.070> no<00:01:09.409> no<00:01:10.409> flowers<00:01:10.830> on

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
wait and see there's no no flowers on

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
wait and see there's no no flowers on
these<00:01:11.100> yet<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.549> these<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:11.909> next<00:01:12.659> season

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
these yet so these will be next season

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990 
these yet so these will be next season
but<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.799> these<00:01:14.010> ones<00:01:14.310> we've<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.880> little

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
but on these ones we've got some little

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.960 
but on these ones we've got some little
flowers<00:01:15.270> coming<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.280> there<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.490> possibly

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
flowers coming up in there so possibly

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.340 
flowers coming up in there so possibly
might<00:01:18.270> get<00:01:18.420> some<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> end<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> season

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
might get some the end of the season

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280 
might get some the end of the season
like<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> leaves<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.610> either<00:01:21.119> put<00:01:22.110> your

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
like it leaves these are either put your

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
like it leaves these are either put your
cares<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.250> Jolokia<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> size<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
cares or be Jolokia the size of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
cares or be Jolokia the size of the
flowers<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.750> thinking<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.650> probably<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.009> big

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
flowers I'm thinking it's probably a big

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200 
flowers I'm thinking it's probably a big
because<00:01:30.000> they're<00:01:30.210> smaller<00:01:30.540> Chile<00:01:31.759> now<00:01:32.759> moving

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
because they're smaller Chile now moving

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
because they're smaller Chile now moving
