have<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.310> put<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> two

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
have now you can put this on two

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
have now you can put this on two
different<00:02:03.299> ways<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
different ways you can put it like this

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.149 
different ways you can put it like this
or<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.509> don't<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.780> there's

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
or like this I don't think there's

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.460 
or like this I don't think there's
right<00:02:07.310> or<00:02:07.460> wrong<00:02:07.670> way<00:02:07.909> if<00:02:08.599> I'm<00:02:08.780> honest<00:02:09.229> it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
right or wrong way if I'm honest it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.040 
right or wrong way if I'm honest it
looks<00:02:09.500> better<00:02:10.220> if<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.269> lip<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.690> pointing

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
looks better if this lip is pointing

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.300 
looks better if this lip is pointing
down<00:02:12.260> had<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:12.980> nice<00:02:13.269> flat<00:02:14.269> surface<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:16.099> if<00:02:16.250> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
down had this nice flat surface but if I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.949 
down had this nice flat surface but if I
cared<00:02:16.519> about<00:02:16.580> looks<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.450> wouldn't<00:02:17.690> be<00:02:17.720> writing

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
cared about looks it wouldn't be writing

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.830 
cared about looks it wouldn't be writing
a<00:02:18.080> KLR<00:02:18.440> 650<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.360> gonna<00:02:20.480> mount<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.780> like

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
a KLR 650 so I'm gonna mount it like

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.800 
a KLR 650 so I'm gonna mount it like
this<00:02:21.200> because<00:02:21.890> having<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.459> extra<00:02:22.519> lip<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
this because having this extra lip and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.530 
this because having this extra lip and
the<00:02:23.930> group<00:02:24.170> will<00:02:24.470> hold<00:02:24.799> stuff<00:02:25.099> on<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.060> plate<00:02:26.299> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the group will hold stuff on the plate a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
the group will hold stuff on the plate a
little<00:02:26.660> bit<00:02:26.900> better<00:02:27.099> one<00:02:28.099> thing<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.489> have

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
little bit better one thing that I have

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.640 
little bit better one thing that I have
noticed<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.209> these<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.959> holes<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
noticed is that these the holes that I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.400 
noticed is that these the holes that I
need<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.040> put<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.400> screws<00:02:31.760> back<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:32.410> this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
need to put the screws back in this

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.190 
need to put the screws back in this
rubber<00:02:33.890> piece<00:02:34.280> underneath<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> movies<00:02:35.720> it's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
rubber piece underneath the movies it's

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.160 
rubber piece underneath the movies it's
kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.560> not<00:02:36.769> lining<00:02:37.129> up<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:38.420> don't<00:02:38.900> find<00:02:39.080> it

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
kind of not lining up so don't find it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.220 
kind of not lining up so don't find it
too<00:02:39.200> much<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.739> reach<00:02:40.010> down<00:02:40.040> there<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.579> push

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
too much just reach down there and push

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.970 
too much just reach down there and push
reach<00:02:42.230> down<00:02:42.440> there<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.650> push<00:02:43.069> this<00:02:43.310> piece<00:02:43.579> in

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
reach down there and push this piece in

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.520 
reach down there and push this piece in
see<00:02:45.980> how<00:02:46.040> there's<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.519> gap<00:02:47.019> between<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.260> rubber

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
see how there's a gap between the rubber

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.740 
see how there's a gap between the rubber
and<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.069> metal<00:02:49.310> piece<00:02:49.549> push<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.720> a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
and the metal piece push that in a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.960 
and the metal piece push that in a
little<00:02:50.900> bit<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.519> straighten<00:02:52.879> it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
little bit and that's just straighten it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:05.500 
little bit and that's just straighten it
out

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.429 

oh<00:03:10.780> well<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.959> looks<00:03:12.110> like<00:03:12.170> I've<00:03:12.349> done

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
oh well it looks like I've done

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.500 
oh well it looks like I've done
something<00:03:12.500> wrong<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.209> there<00:03:14.209> are<00:03:14.329> two

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
something wrong because there are two

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.330 
something wrong because there are two
holes<00:03:15.019> here<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.439> there<00:03:15.920> are<00:03:15.980> bolts<00:03:16.220> down

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
holes here and there are bolts down

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.539 
holes here and there are bolts down

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.000 
sometimes you end up with extra pieces
well<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:27.140> decided<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.799> go<00:03:27.890> with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
well there it is I decided to go with

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.380 
well there it is I decided to go with
five<00:03:28.280> bolts<00:03:28.700> until<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.209> can<00:03:29.540> get<00:03:30.220> tap<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.760> fix

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
five bolts until I can get tap to fix

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.690 
five bolts until I can get tap to fix
those<00:03:32.569> threats<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.140> destroyed<00:03:33.640> but<00:03:34.640> I

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700
