00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.089 
so using this color here we're just
going<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> blend<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.230> through<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.830> crease

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
going to blend that through the crease

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.550 
going to blend that through the crease
just<00:03:49.879> to<00:03:50.150> define<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> little<00:03:51.110> bit<00:03:51.349> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
just to define it a little bit and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:03.369 
just to define it a little bit and
create<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:52.069> subtle<00:03:52.610> shadow

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.369

cool-toned brown underneath the eye and
this<00:04:14.219> is<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.670> gonna<00:04:14.939> create<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.450> shadow<00:04:15.840> and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
this is just gonna create a shadow and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.140 
this is just gonna create a shadow and
make<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.739> look<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> little<00:04:17.220> bit<00:04:17.489> more<00:04:17.699> defined

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419

and I'll see you in my next video bye so
I<00:06:18.129> forgot<00:06:18.309> to<00:06:18.430> say<00:06:18.610> in<00:06:18.729> the<00:06:18.849> video<00:06:19.059> guys<00:06:19.360> but<00:06:19.689> I

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
I forgot to say in the video guys but I

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.049 
I forgot to say in the video guys but I
actually<00:06:19.930> applied<00:06:20.499> some<00:06:20.800> corner<00:06:21.339> lashes<00:06:21.879> and

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:22.059 
actually applied some corner lashes and

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:24.749 
actually applied some corner lashes and
this<00:06:22.599> just<00:06:22.870> really<00:06:23.229> elongates<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.099> eye<00:06:24.339> and

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
this just really elongates the eye and

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.629 
this just really elongates the eye and
adds<00:06:25.029> to<00:06:25.539> that<00:06:25.569> effect<00:06:26.229> as<00:06:26.409> well<00:06:26.740> so<00:06:26.979> that<00:06:27.520> is

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
adds to that effect as well so that is

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.439 
adds to that effect as well so that is
obviously<00:06:27.930> optional<00:06:28.930> okay
