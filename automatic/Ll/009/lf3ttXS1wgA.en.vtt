00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
snake something a little different like

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.009

eels<00:00:47.400> there<00:00:47.850> were<00:00:47.940> something<00:00:48.150> a<00:00:48.449> body<00:00:48.839> that's

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
eels there were something a body that's

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.860 
eels there were something a body that's
been<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.470> aquatic<00:00:50.160> inspired<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.269> then<00:00:51.570> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
been more aquatic inspired and then from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
been more aquatic inspired and then from
there<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.260> decided<00:00:52.290> that<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> little

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
there we decided that this was a little

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
there we decided that this was a little
too<00:00:53.730> still<00:00:54.449> too<00:00:54.690> generic<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.500> decided<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
too still too generic so we decided to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.219 
too still too generic so we decided to
take<00:00:56.100> her<00:00:56.339> even<00:00:56.940> further<00:00:57.150> however<00:00:57.720> hanging

take her even further however hanging
from<00:00:58.350> herself<00:00:58.680> hanging<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.400> eels<00:00:59.610> that

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
from herself hanging from the eels that

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.719 
from herself hanging from the eels that
make<00:01:00.119> up<00:01:00.330> her<00:01:00.780> body<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.400> then<00:01:02.400> they<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.699> know

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and turns them into 3d models so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
and turns them into 3d models so
basically<00:01:21.540> i<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> concept<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> i'll

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
basically i take the concept and i'll

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300 
basically i take the concept and i'll
get<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> basic<00:01:24.900> environment<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> level

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
get the basic environment from the level

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
get the basic environment from the level
artist<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.150> i<00:01:27.210> started<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> build<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.140> medusa

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
artist and i started to build the medusa

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
artist and i started to build the medusa
into<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.860> environment<00:01:29.179> i'll<00:01:30.179> set<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.479> cameras

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
into the environment i'll set up cameras

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.639 
into the environment i'll set up cameras
that<00:01:31.579> match<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.240> angle<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.810> perspective<00:01:34.499> of

that match the angle and perspective of

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.649 
that match the angle and perspective of
the<00:01:34.799> concept<00:01:35.429> art<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.119> i'll<00:01:36.240> even<00:01:36.390> load

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the concept art and then i'll even load

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.380 
the concept art and then i'll even load
in<00:01:36.810> characters<00:01:37.560> such<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> jason<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.060> first

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the programming been dekhna is one of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.690 
the programming been dekhna is one of
our<00:02:58.470> programmers<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.160> he's<00:02:59.370> handling

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
basically I have to be the brain and put

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.890 
basically I have to be the brain and put
them<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.440> together<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.880> one<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> unique

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
them all together and one of the unique

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.990 
them all together and one of the unique
challenges<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.410> Medusa<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.010> there's<00:03:08.850> really

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
challenges with Medusa is there's really

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.150 
challenges with Medusa is there's really
four<00:03:09.330> enemies<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.020> fight<00:03:10.200> there's<00:03:10.680> four

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
four enemies in the fight there's four

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.860 
four enemies in the fight there's four
yields<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:11.730> they<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.300> have<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.510> coordinate

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
yields but they all have to coordinate

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
yields but they all have to coordinate
together<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.620> they<00:03:13.950> don't<00:03:14.280> pressure<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
together so that they don't pressure the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.010 
together so that they don't pressure the
player<00:03:15.000> too<00:03:15.209> much<00:03:15.360> they<00:03:15.600> don't<00:03:15.690> get<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.959> each

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
player too much they don't get in each

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.380 
player too much they don't get in each
other's<00:03:16.290> way<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.830> they<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.880> still<00:03:18.090> keep<00:03:18.270> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
other's way and they can still keep the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.510 
other's way and they can still keep the
player<00:03:18.540> engaged<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.140> whole<00:03:19.200> time<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.040> there's

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
player engaged the whole time so there's

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.340 
player engaged the whole time so there's
a<00:03:20.580> lot<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.730> logic<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.510> goes<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.870> underneath

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
a lot of logic that goes on underneath

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.380 
a lot of logic that goes on underneath
that<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> put<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.180> these

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
that that I have to put in so that these

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.479 
that that I have to put in so that these
eels<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:25.050> keep<00:03:25.380> getting<00:03:25.530> fun<00:03:25.860> keeping<00:03:26.370> them

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
eels can keep getting fun keeping them

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.370 
eels can keep getting fun keeping them
