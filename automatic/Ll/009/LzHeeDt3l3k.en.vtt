either<00:00:05.580> one<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.150> two<00:00:06.180> easter<00:00:06.600> eggs<00:00:06.750> I'm

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
either one of the two easter eggs I'm

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.839 
either one of the two easter eggs I'm
thinking<00:00:07.319> one<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.980> them<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.099> call<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.550> duty

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
thinking one of them is call of duty

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.459 
thinking one of them is call of duty
which<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> main<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.139> I'm<00:00:10.349> thinking

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
which is the main one that I'm thinking

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
which is the main one that I'm thinking
just<00:00:10.889> because<00:00:11.190> as<00:00:11.460> you'll<00:00:11.639> see<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> second

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
just because as you'll see in a second

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.879 
just because as you'll see in a second
that's<00:00:13.019> one<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.320> kind<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> makes<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.740> most

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
that's one that kind of makes the most

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.180 
that's one that kind of makes the most
sense<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.429> other<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.920> well<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
sense and the other one was well what

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.820 
sense and the other one was well what

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
little kid named ZT like on call of duty
and<00:01:14.909> stuff<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.590> that's<00:01:16.590> been<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and stuff like that so that's been a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
and stuff like that so that's been a
little<00:01:16.920> hint<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> 720

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
little hint at it you know the 720

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
little hint at it you know the 720
noscope<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:20.939> why<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
noscope thing so that's why I kind of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
noscope thing so that's why I kind of
think<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.720> call<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.990> duty<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
think it's call of duty but then as you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
think it's call of duty but then as you
can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.000> once<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.080> all<00:01:25.290> loads<00:01:25.500> hold<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
can see once this all loads hold on a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.149 
can see once this all loads hold on a
second<00:01:26.250> they're<00:01:26.850> taking<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.180> load<00:01:28.070> what<00:01:29.070> you
