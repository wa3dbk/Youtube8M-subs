00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.800
 there a father and son arouse interest 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.980
 the European community with an idea 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.640
 creative and fascinating way not to pollute 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.130
 air 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.559
 they are making use of a form of 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.470
 energy that is in every band that the 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.910
 people feel but do not see and it does not cost 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:51.150
 nothing with you the first car in the world 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:54.400
 powered by 80 horsepower 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.979
 maximum speed of 150 kilometers per 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 hour 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:02.409
 300 km range to hit 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.479
 this round-shape position is so 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.210
 simple and cheap with teapot the tire 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.170
 a bike will use even the same 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.470
 equipment 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 that old compressed air pump 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 usually forgotten at the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.060
 gasoline 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.979
 fills with pride with so much newness 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.570
 in one vehicle is the engineer 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.820
 french vinegar 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.860
 after spending 30 years building 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 increasingly faster engines for the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.920
 formula 1 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.420
 deny wanted to run after another 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.180
 challenge type 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.120
 called children from laughing at sharing the same 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.060
 passion for engines and after four years of 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.490
 much dedication the dream of the car that does not 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.490
 dirty, finally left the paper 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.460
 even so the goiás I defend if he 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.020
 explains that the new engine works with 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.450
 only two cylinders 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.580
 they mix the air that comes from outside with 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 Compressed air coming out of the car tank 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.340
 at the moment the two air jets are 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.360
 find the temperature reaches 400 degrees 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 centigrade 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.789
 is the pressure increases so much that the super 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.479
 causes the motor to rotate with 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479
 facility 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.099
 in the small but well-equipped factory in 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.319
 suburb of pinions 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.299
 the soon to be a philosophy of the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.690
 Formula 1 vehicles 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.700
 one must always perfect it shows 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.400
 that the car received special filters 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.920
 to purify the air passing through the engine 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.230
 Can you imagine that? 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.849
 we asked to bring this machine 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.040
 to prove what seems impossible 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.190
 when we talk in a car 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.799
 the air comes out purer from the exhaust than 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.120
 when it goes in there by the engine 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.400
 We'll call the squid and please. 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.810
 read the official here who will do the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.450
 Test, we're going to put this 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.760
 equipment in the car exhaust and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.670
 here we follow the result by 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.440
 an electronic meter just turn on does not see 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.430
 Now look, you 're saying no monoxide. 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.739
 no carbon dioxide in the air 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.520
 of two other pollutants and 21% of 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.800
 oxygen in the air means the pure athlete 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.550
 the same test is done in a car at 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.280
 gasoline 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.530
 the result is the inverse of the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.620
 oxygen drops to 9 percent 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.930
 compensation for pollutants to dance to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.630
 atmosphere at the price of 13 thousand dollars 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.820
 the definitive version of the taxi moved in the air 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.490
 should be launched in one 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.010
 prototype in the taxi der pollution how it went 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.370
 baptized is already a public success and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.370
 has won 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.700
 city ​​of mexico 1 with paris roma 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.550
 cairo the list of interested in the taxi 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.060
 clean instead is great 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.300
 and the future of the taxi seen has everything to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.300
 succeed
