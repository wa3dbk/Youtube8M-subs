 super individualized 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.950
 according to that organism by digestion 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.950
 that absorption of that person 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450
 My name is lidiane barbosa.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.850
 gluten free chocolate without lactose 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 We're going to use four eggs. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 mexican sugar demerara half cup 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.390
 two cups of coconut oil and a half 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.170
 full of rice flour half cup 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.420
 cocoa powder the yeast and a glass of water 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.900
 500 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 We're going to put four whole eggs 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 in the ball of the mixer the sugar demerara 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.159
 coconut oil and cocoa powder and now the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.159
 people are going to beat up to double in volume 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 the point of this mix that we hit 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.689
 to be very cute as you are here to 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.409
 people add the other ingredients 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.540
 now I'll put half the flour 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.410
 hit a little bit and adding 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.000
 gradually the rest 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.150
 now I'll put a little more of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.150
 flour and I go alternating with hot water 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.960
 and this is the point of our mass too 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.820
 fluffy and now for the last minute 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.410
 stirring with a spoon 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 I'm going to put pepper 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.590
 this formula was assembled with oil of 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.800
 coconut and rice flour and now I go 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.870
 put our mass and now people 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.140
 will put in the preheated medium oven 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.140
 at 180 degrees for 30 minutes 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.470
 also a curiosity about the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.170
 gluten-free preparations and gives you 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.760
 the whole city ​​but I know the masses 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.050
 so when we do not use the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.700
 gluten as in the case here that people 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.910
 is optimizing rice flour to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.560
 people ask about the city but if he then 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.590
 What I add to my income 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.040
 some facing some xanthan is a 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 pozinho and is more or less a glue that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 returns this patience and elasticity 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.220
 amazon 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.959
 I recommend a coffee spoon for 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.420
 each kilo of weight 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.230
 to the end of the preparation before baking 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.230
 for example bread 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.720
 the green banana biomass a food 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.560
 superversátil nutritional super is like 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.380
 we do is the green banana boiled and then 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.220
 you peel and grind is simple and 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.080
 there is biomass 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.310
 Now we are going to prepare an ice cream 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.530
 functional 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.560
 for him we will use a cup 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.800
 of green banana biomass and 150 grams 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.140
 of chocolate 70% cocoa 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.319
 in this case we are using the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.870
 Chocolate gluten and lactose and 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.630
 now we'll put it on 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:00.610
 blender to beat and chocolate 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:06.060
 those that's already melted in rett 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.060
 bath-water and now it 's just knocking 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.430
 our ice cream is ready 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.790
 so our ice cream is ready 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.680
 he will stay in the freezer for 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.160
 approximately three hours 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.200
 if we want to make a hand if that 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.350
 same reading we will put in the 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.970
 blender a zh coffee spoon and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.919
 it will look like a 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.960
 music, we want to make a ganache 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.300
 We can put a little book of 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.860
 coconut milk also before taking 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.820
 blender and hit and we'll 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.820
 power to cover a goal
