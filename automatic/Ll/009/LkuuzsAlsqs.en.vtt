is<00:00:41.579> hammer<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:43.129> i'm<00:00:44.129> probably<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.850> using<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
is hammer and i'm probably not using the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
for this class but i will try and get as

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.889 
for this class but i will try and get as
many<00:00:52.199> kills<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.620> possible<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> maps<00:00:54.660> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
many kills as possible a lot of maps on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.950 
many kills as possible a lot of maps on
crisis<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.500> extremely<00:00:56.129> open<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.960> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
crisis are extremely open and that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
crisis are extremely open and that
coupled<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> fact<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.160> pistols<00:00:59.670> pretty

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
coupled was the fact that pistols pretty

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.709 
coupled was the fact that pistols pretty
much<00:01:00.300> useless<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.730> not<00:01:02.730> used<00:01:03.000> correctly<00:01:03.120> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
much useless if not used correctly in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.690 
much useless if not used correctly in
crisis<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.470> net

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.969

something else like that that that
killed<00:01:18.049> me<00:01:18.170> from<00:01:18.320> behind<00:01:20.140> unlike<00:01:21.140> use<00:01:21.439> my

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
killed me from behind unlike use my

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.279 
killed me from behind unlike use my
usual<00:01:22.189> gameplay<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.700> crisis<00:01:23.270> i<00:01:23.450> found<00:01:24.170> that

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
usual gameplay in crisis i found that

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.200 
usual gameplay in crisis i found that
armor<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:24.829> very<00:01:25.069> useful<00:01:25.429> when<00:01:25.460> using<00:01:25.819> pistols

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
armor is very useful when using pistols

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.880 
armor is very useful when using pistols
i<00:01:26.390> am<00:01:27.049> trying<00:01:27.799> to<00:01:27.979> get<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:29.110> module<00:01:30.110> for<00:01:30.140> armor

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
i am trying to get a module for armor

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.059 
i am trying to get a module for armor
actually<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.490> get<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> more<00:01:32.630> armor<00:01:33.259> on<00:01:33.439> me<00:01:33.860> and

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
actually to get a more armor on me and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.669 
actually to get a more armor on me and
so<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.610> use<00:01:34.789> less<00:01:35.030> energy<00:01:35.240> but<00:01:35.659> for<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:35.990> i<00:01:36.229> do

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
so we use less energy but for now i do

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.440 
so we use less energy but for now i do
not<00:01:36.920> have<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.700> i'm<00:01:37.789> forced<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.210> use<00:01:38.420> a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
not have that and i'm forced to use a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.139 
not have that and i'm forced to use a
subpar<00:01:39.289> layout<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:40.429> particular<00:01:40.880> class

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
subpar layout for this particular class

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.039 
subpar layout for this particular class
now<00:01:41.569> um<00:01:42.009> unlike<00:01:43.009> many<00:01:43.280> other<00:01:43.520> gameplays<00:01:44.270> using

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
now um unlike many other gameplays using

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.830 
now um unlike many other gameplays using
pistols<00:01:45.590> is<00:01:45.770> much<00:01:46.220> much<00:01:46.939> tougher<00:01:47.270> than<00:01:47.569> it<00:01:47.689> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
pistols is much much tougher than it is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.649 
pistols is much much tougher than it is
would<00:01:48.049> be<00:01:48.200> using<00:01:48.799> some<00:01:49.069> other<00:01:49.280> fancy<00:01:50.090> gun<00:01:50.450> got

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
would be using some other fancy gun got

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.749 
would be using some other fancy gun got
an<00:01:50.750> assistant<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:51.200> kill<00:01:51.590> because<00:01:52.280> one

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
an assistant that kill because one

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.490 
an assistant that kill because one
pistols<00:01:53.390> don't<00:01:53.599> have<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.899> high<00:01:54.140> rate<00:01:54.349> of<00:01:54.380> fire

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
pistols don't have the high rate of fire

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.039 
pistols don't have the high rate of fire
to<00:01:55.220> they<00:01:55.369> don't<00:01:55.549> have<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.939> killing<00:01:56.479> punch<00:01:56.810> like

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
to they don't have a killing punch like

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.569 
to they don't have a killing punch like
other<00:01:57.439> weapons<00:01:58.099> wood<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.860> armor<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:00.890> modules

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
other weapons wood and armor are modules

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.789 
other weapons wood and armor are modules
can<00:02:01.759> also<00:02:01.939> be<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.209> pain<00:02:02.509> armor<00:02:03.319> which<00:02:03.470> tends<00:02:03.709> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
can also be a pain armor which tends the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.419 
can also be a pain armor which tends the
boots<00:02:04.069> rather<00:02:04.429> well<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.229> camo<00:02:06.429> obviously

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
boots rather well and camo obviously

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.779 
boots rather well and camo obviously
it's<00:02:08.030> self-explanatory<00:02:09.130> get<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> drop<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.579> from

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it's self-explanatory get a drop in from

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.349 
it's self-explanatory get a drop in from
behind<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.299> am<00:02:11.480> running<00:02:11.599> tracker<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:13.359> proxy

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
behind I am running tracker and proxy

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.599 
behind I am running tracker and proxy
proximity<00:02:15.109> alarm<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.730> that's<00:02:16.959> also<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.500> good

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
proximity alarm and that's also a good

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.600 
proximity alarm and that's also a good
there<00:02:19.609> we<00:02:19.730> go

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
there we go

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.730 
there we go
no<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.480> was<00:02:22.630> not<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.870> guy<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.590> thought

disappointed right now but it's getting
slightly<00:04:54.640> frustrated<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.330> hope<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.690> as<00:04:55.840> I

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
slightly frustrated I hope that as I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.230 
slightly frustrated I hope that as I
like<00:04:56.230> more<00:04:56.440> pistols<00:04:56.890> for<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.280> game<00:04:57.550> it'll

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
like more pistols for this game it'll

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.840 
like more pistols for this game it'll
become<00:04:58.360> much<00:04:59.110> more<00:04:59.350> fluids<00:04:59.950> for<00:05:00.130> me<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.640> play

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
become much more fluids for me to play

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.420 
become much more fluids for me to play
with<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.270> saw<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.690> black<00:05:02.050> ops<00:05:02.320> is<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.770> best

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
with I saw the black ops is the best

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.090 
with I saw the black ops is the best
game<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.060> use<00:05:04.210> pistols<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.260> that's<00:05:05.800> funny

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
game to use pistols and and that's funny

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.190 
game to use pistols and and that's funny
because<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.460> start<00:05:06.760> using<00:05:06.910> crystals<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:07.570> black

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
because I start using crystals and black

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.380 
because I start using crystals and black
ops<00:05:08.470> rather<00:05:08.740> than<00:05:08.860> any<00:05:09.040> other<00:05:09.250> game<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:10.180> it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
ops rather than any other game so it

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.290 
ops rather than any other game so it
took<00:05:10.630> me<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.530> play<00:05:11.740> other<00:05:11.980> games<00:05:12.070> with<00:05:12.850> pistols

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
took me to play other games with pistols

not have a chance even though I had a
shot<00:06:08.280> him<00:06:08.400> he<00:06:08.490> had<00:06:08.580> a<00:06:08.610> close-range<00:06:09.150> judgment

an<00:06:09.750> automatic<00:06:10.230> shotgun<00:06:10.620> and<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:10.980> is<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.460> pain

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
an automatic shotgun and that is a pain

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.550 
an automatic shotgun and that is a pain
in<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.180> ass<00:06:12.360> or<00:06:12.570> somebody<00:06:12.930> at<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.290> such<00:06:13.530> a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
in the ass or somebody at that such a

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.690 
in the ass or somebody at that such a
close<00:06:13.980> range<00:06:14.480> so<00:06:15.590> this<00:06:16.590> game<00:06:16.920> is<00:06:16.950> definitely

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
close range so this game is definitely

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.110 
close range so this game is definitely
not<00:06:17.850> made<00:06:18.090> for<00:06:18.240> pistols<00:06:18.630> only<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:19.140> I<00:06:20.040> mean<00:06:20.820> if

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
not made for pistols only and I mean if

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.090 
not made for pistols only and I mean if
this<00:06:21.570> is<00:06:21.690> not<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:21.930> is<00:06:22.260> not<00:06:22.440> proved<00:06:22.830> enough

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
this is not it is not proved enough

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.310 
this is not it is not proved enough
there<00:06:23.610> you<00:06:23.730> go<00:06:23.880> you<00:06:23.940> see<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.360> if<00:06:24.990> it's<00:06:25.200> not

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
there you go you see that if it's not
