one
I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.850> slide<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.119> underneath<00:00:21.539> the

I'm going to slide it underneath the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.870 
I'm going to slide it underneath the
flooring<00:00:22.189> see<00:00:23.189> if<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.490> break<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.789> free

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
flooring see if we can break it free

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
flooring see if we can break it free
that<00:00:26.880> came<00:00:27.060> off<00:00:27.269> nice<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.380> mastic<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that came off nice that was mastic and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.710 
that came off nice that was mastic and
the<00:00:29.099> mastic<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.580> pretty<00:00:29.760> dry<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> rest<00:00:30.630> of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the mastic is pretty dry so the rest of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
the mastic is pretty dry so the rest of
the<00:00:30.779> tile<00:00:31.019> should<00:00:31.199> come<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.500> easy<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.399> have

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the tile should come up easy but we have

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
the tile should come up easy but we have
a<00:00:32.579> plywood<00:00:32.880> subfloor<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.559> screwed<00:00:34.950> down

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
a plywood subfloor and it's screwed down

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
a plywood subfloor and it's screwed down
so<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.300> easy<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.660> think

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so that will come up pretty easy I think

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
so that will come up pretty easy I think
what<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> remove<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.040> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
kitchen cabinets were run so the kitchen

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.350 
kitchen cabinets were run so the kitchen
cabinets<00:01:57.280> are<00:01:57.430> on<00:01:57.580> top<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.000> underlayment

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
cabinets are on top of the underlayment

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.330 
cabinets are on top of the underlayment
yeah<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:58.960> what<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.320> need<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.680> do<00:01:59.830> is<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.100> need<00:02:00.280> to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
yeah so what we need to do is we need to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.460 
yeah so what we need to do is we need to
cut<00:02:00.700> around<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.150> perimeter<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.960> cabinets

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
cut around the perimeter of the cabinets

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.550 
cut around the perimeter of the cabinets
and<00:02:02.650> also<00:02:03.580> against<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.150> toe<00:02:04.330> kick<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.470> we

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
and also against the toe kick so that we

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.710 
and also against the toe kick so that we
can<00:02:05.710> remove<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.310> underlayment<00:02:06.729> now<00:02:07.540> what

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
can remove the underlayment now what

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.389 
can remove the underlayment now what
I've<00:02:07.840> done<00:02:07.870> is<00:02:08.080> I've<00:02:08.350> rented<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.860> saw<00:02:09.100> right

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
I've done is I've rented this saw right

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.970 
I've done is I've rented this saw right
here<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.880> called<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.240> toe<00:02:10.509> kick<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.140> all

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
here it's called the toe kick so I all

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.770 
here it's called the toe kick so I all
right<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> problem<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.480> saw<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
right but the problem with this saw is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.900 
right but the problem with this saw is
if<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.470> lay<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:14.950> top<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.340> countertop<00:02:15.640> you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
if I lay it on top of the countertop you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.000 
if I lay it on top of the countertop you
can<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.240> looking<00:02:16.630> here<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.020> edge<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.740> saw

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
can see looking here in the edge the saw

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.040 
can see looking here in the edge the saw
goes<00:02:18.400> down<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.970> three-quarters<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.930> an

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
goes down about three-quarters of an

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.040 
goes down about three-quarters of an
inch<00:02:20.140> deep<00:02:20.440> that's<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.730> deep<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.300> don't<00:02:22.720> want

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
inch deep that's too deep I don't want

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.230 
inch deep that's too deep I don't want
to<00:02:23.140> cut<00:02:23.350> into<00:02:23.680> your<00:02:23.830> strip<00:02:24.250> floor<00:02:24.580> right<00:02:24.790> all

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
right so I need to raise that SAR up a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.400 
right so I need to raise that SAR up a
half<00:02:27.880> an<00:02:28.060> inch<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.600> saw<00:02:28.840> can't<00:02:29.200> be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
half an inch and this saw can't be

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.530 
half an inch and this saw can't be
adjusted<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:30.940> I've<00:02:31.060> done<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.420> I've

fiberboard a scrap piece we're going to
raise<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.540> saw<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.320> now<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.739> piece<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.130> a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
raise the saw on it now this piece is a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.430 
raise the saw on it now this piece is a
half<00:02:39.459> an<00:02:39.580> inch<00:02:39.730> thick<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.690> blade<00:02:40.930> did<00:02:41.200> cut

half an inch thick the blade did cut

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.870 
half an inch thick the blade did cut
three<00:02:41.680> quarters<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.130> an<00:02:42.250> inch<00:02:42.310> we're<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.820> to

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
three quarters of an inch we're going to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.670 
three quarters of an inch we're going to
raise<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.390> half<00:02:43.570> making<00:02:43.930> our<00:02:44.170> depth<00:02:44.440> a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
raise it up a half making our depth a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.979 
raise it up a half making our depth a
quarter<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> an<00:02:45.370> inch<00:02:45.459> deep<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.330> thickness<00:02:46.840> of

now the saw uncle tied into the corner

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.899 
now the saw uncle tied into the corner
so<00:03:02.769> I'm<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.040> use<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.189> different<00:03:03.549> type<00:03:03.700> of

so I'm going to use a different type of

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.940 
so I'm going to use a different type of
saw<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.120> do<00:03:04.329> that<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.560> I'm<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:05.890> use

saw to do that do that I'm going to use

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.670 
saw to do that do that I'm going to use
an<00:03:06.250> oscillating<00:03:06.909> saw<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.900> blade<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.319> flush

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
an oscillating saw the blade is a flush

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.619 
an oscillating saw the blade is a flush
cutting<00:03:08.980> blade<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:09.909> go<00:03:10.000> flush<00:03:10.299> against

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
cutting blade so I can go flush against

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.479 
cutting blade so I can go flush against
the<00:03:10.689> cabinet<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.680> goes<00:03:11.829> back<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.280> forth

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489
