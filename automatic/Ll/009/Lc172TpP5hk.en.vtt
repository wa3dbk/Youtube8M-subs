00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.379
 hello very good good I make this video 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.790
 mister crust and I make this video in 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.710
 answer to the chick you are teaching 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 stats 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.310
 here I will teach mine and nobody else 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 only the measures we are going to see we are 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 here the crust 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.090
 the death story we see that I earn you 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.529
 it's important because since you say that the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.540
 proportion of victories is not important 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.890
 how good are we going to leave it there and it gives me 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.480
 equal the proportion of victories has 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.810
 its us good package I do not care 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.790
 let's leave it to the margin 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.800
 lowers death does not matter at all 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.680
 ok and I agree with you 309 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.370
 well I have a little more points for 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.640
 minute 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 to see how many you have you have mounted 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.940
 518 you have a value of 588 I have 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 The important thing is that I've been three days 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.129
 game and 12 hours this takes 6 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 and well let's see what I want 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:10.310
 focus on the medals that medals the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.860
 game leads is a nuclear lifted 5 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.090
 and it says good I do not have the nuclear either 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.619
 nuclear the courts in my channel the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.079
 majority but in other channels out there 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.920
 who pronounced me I'm not going with what 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.180
 Most will be no new who 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.009
 either he has not been looking 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.700
 come out like this I actually have a shotgun 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.590
 with dogs and swarm and good 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.840
 let's look at the game site tutu 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.750
 an ultra low of 89 in 3 18 5 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.719
 in gambling sites except four casualties 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.060
 of seven I between the 10 of 85 principles 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.020
 of game he accepted another low of 62 from 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 they have done 19 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.829
 between the game being you have made 45 casualties 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.390
 fast of 52 868 in three days in three 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.909
 days 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.840
 in 3 days of 8 200 a furious low 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.770
 I had six days at 762 a little bit rural 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.580
 state 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.440
 little by little, let's see 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.330
 It's the difference between you and me that you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.860
 You play like a rat whore hidden in 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.990
 a corner and behind the coverage 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.020
 the last one is the last one I saw because I 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.250
 I do not want to follow your channel but this one 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.260
 video type I pass it from the mine that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.790
 I had a little pullita is good come on let's go 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.900
 to answer him man if he was he has 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.550
 I want you to answer with my 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.140
 I will answer you statistics 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.690
 do not worry about being here I am 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.450
 to answer the skirt you follow 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.090
 game taken how many 375 forget them 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.800
 I carry 598 in three days half of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.120
 time came almost twice as long as you and 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320
 over and extrapolate whenever it is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.820
 probably me what you say in your 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.150
 video that you put it on, they always take you out 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.930
 half of me in double time 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.280
 well it is also true that it is a 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.110
 little of the recipes of casualties that you use 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.280
 you instead of subtracting support as 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.140
 it seems that you mess with me for that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.620
 probably reproducing lower than 3 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.780
 the loss of 4 or more and good leaving the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.760
 margin this that neither with 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.200
 statistics while so important and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.850
 so much desire to play with 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.640
 us and so good you think I do not know 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.800
 why the hell do you give of the games and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480
 It's one thing for you to go with dogs that 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.370
 Well there I do not get involved with you if I 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.280
 we had but it's the game and it has 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.600
 chosen has been by mirabal 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:23.580
 but the previous one a little shit is for 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.580
 urge a little bit of cow poop 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.090
 leaving the statistics going 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.440
 to happen to see something that you are not in the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.050
 Whore life that I put it on video 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.420
 and so after that's precisely why 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:42.440
 because I have to explain myself because the load 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.440
 23 according to afi of 6 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.700
 in which I swarm and dogs you 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.380
 you would not have thrown in there having the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.170
 streak seeing that they were all out of 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.520
 the thick house we go and for god do not you 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.050
 you had waited there behind the house 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.310
 that it will happen that they probably have 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.870
 killed I do not ask that we would have been killed 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 but also expected and behind in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.680
 place to go out with a couple of eggs like 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.450
 the state I know is the difference 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.099
 between your game of mine that you play 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.370
 behind a cover and always 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.200
 waiting with a real rat and I 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.709
 I go out and play rus 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.560
 well here I leave you here I leave this video 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.580
 and I'll leave you but also so that 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.190
 not only and also how you get one 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.080
 work is worth in raid 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.310
 I see that you yours back doing that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.650
 also the flea is very clear then 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.830
 look at the game well the truth that does not 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.830
 I give importance 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.060
 and good to be split in the row now 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.229
 that costs me the only one taking off my streak 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.630
 that I have a few puts on my channel 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.889
 that if you want to learn a little 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.080
 how to play then you can see them 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.940
 I also have them out there not you 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.000
 worry another thing about sending you 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.190
 of people who were an asshole for the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.650
 deal you've had towards us but 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.910
 first the retarded because if really 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.290
 you do not like what we do and such a 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.660
 simple how to pass from us do not 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.890
 you have to advertise you are not 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.840
 making free advertising is a 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.690
 a little bit short but good 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.150
 let's leave line you know why because 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.950
 there are other youtube that give you 25 thousand 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.140
 turns like for example found in 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.390
 other items such as a payment 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.590
 or synapses that I found them a 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.630
 game and I won and you know what happened then 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.580
 let him have the video and good vibes 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.110
 they took and they gave me a like you know 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.730
 if the thing is already well followed and now 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.020
 I 'm fucking fucking with them either 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.670
 I wanted to say that they are better 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.990
 provisional friends lie we go that we 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.540
 games with them I tell you yes 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.550
 I burned myself and he stayed the thing 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.170
 without you how were you a hit and you can 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.460

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.200
