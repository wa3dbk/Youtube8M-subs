 answered the question limiting to 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.560
 close adventures with the most

 instead, it was the directors who wanted to do it 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.980
 go beyond the ideal threshold of the last 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.930
 page of the fairy tale by imagining new ones 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.160
 stories for the characters and what 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.290
 did the Norwegian tommy wirkola

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.190
 starting from the famous tale of gods 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 brothers grimm the director has speculated 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.970
 a future full of satisfactions for i 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.070
 two little brothers escaped from the clutches 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.960
 of the wicked witch become gods 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.620
 ruthless and professional hunters 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.040
 witches 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.040
 I will not let you tell me what to do 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.920
 the best method to kill one

 Wirkola Witch Debuts Hollywood 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.150
 directing films that do not reserve large 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.990
 surprises but that succeeds easily 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.520
 achieve the goal that it was 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.530
 fixed or entertain the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.390
 public with an elementary history in the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.100
 its developments enriched by abundant 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.110
 doses of horror and splatter and da touches 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 funny situations those children have been 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.230
 kidnapped a witch does not come out like this 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.760
 discovered 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.560
 it's not a hunt and it's an experiment 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.930
 from the sure results that it goes to half 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.360
 the film is therefore easily seen without 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.470
 preconceptions or false expectations 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.270

 unleashed and liberating pastime e 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 omitting the flatness of the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 characters 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.990
