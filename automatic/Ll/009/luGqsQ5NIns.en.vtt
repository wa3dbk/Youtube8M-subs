through<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.770> piece<00:01:17.980> by<00:01:18.010> piece<00:01:18.220> now<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
through it piece by piece now the the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.730 
through it piece by piece now the the
first<00:01:21.460> chord<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.420> group<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:22.990> fairly

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
first chord of that group is a fairly

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070 
first chord of that group is a fairly
straightforward<00:01:24.010> chord<00:01:24.700> it's<00:01:25.210> just<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.630> single

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
straightforward chord it's just a single

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.140 
straightforward chord it's just a single
finger<00:01:26.410> here<00:01:26.680> on<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.250> third<00:01:27.730> string<00:01:28.090> fourth

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
finger here on the third string fourth

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.110 
finger here on the third string fourth
fret<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.590> played<00:01:29.860> running<00:01:30.640> your<00:01:30.880> thumb

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
fret and it's played running your thumb

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.230 
fret and it's played running your thumb
all<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.750> way<00:01:31.900> down<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.470> strings<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.910> second

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
all the way down the strings the second

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.610 
all the way down the strings the second
chord<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.420> probably<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.810> toughest<00:01:38.170> chord<00:01:38.470> of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
chord is probably the toughest chord of

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.060 
chord is probably the toughest chord of
this<00:01:38.800> this<00:01:39.460> group<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.820> four<00:01:40.000> chords<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
this this group of four chords it's it's

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.910 
this this group of four chords it's it's
got<00:01:42.310> this<00:01:42.520> P<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:45.330> E<00:01:46.330> all<00:01:46.660> together<00:01:47.050> it's<00:01:47.890> a

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
got this P and E all together it's a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.469 
got this P and E all together it's a
little<00:01:48.070> bit<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.460> stretch<00:01:48.790> as<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.150> can<00:01:49.300> see

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
little bit of a stretch as you can see

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.230 
little bit of a stretch as you can see
my<00:01:49.630> hands<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.340> that's<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.820> stretch<00:01:52.060> for<00:01:52.210> some

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
my hands and that's a stretch for some

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.610 
my hands and that's a stretch for some
people<00:01:52.630> I've<00:01:52.690> got<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:52.960> really<00:01:53.140> get<00:01:53.260> my<00:01:53.350> thumb

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
people I've got to really get my thumb

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.230 
people I've got to really get my thumb
out<00:01:53.830> there<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.520> if<00:01:54.760> some<00:01:54.910> people<00:01:55.120> will

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
out there and if some people will

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.850 
out there and if some people will
actually<00:01:55.540> play<00:01:55.750> capo<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.440> play<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.710> up<00:01:56.800> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
actually play capo and play it up a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.800 
actually play capo and play it up a
little<00:01:56.950> bit<00:01:57.160> higher<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.640> neck<00:01:57.820> because

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
little bit higher on the neck because

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.390 
little bit higher on the neck because
obviously<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.290> spacing<00:01:59.680> guard<00:01:59.860> is<00:01:59.950> far<00:02:00.220> up

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
obviously the spacing guard is far up

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.550 
obviously the spacing guard is far up
here<00:02:00.580> at<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> seventh<00:02:01.210> fret<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.600> farther<00:02:01.900> but

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
here at the seventh fret and farther but

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.359 
here at the seventh fret and farther but
so<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:04.140> chord<00:02:07.679> rolls<00:02:08.679> after<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> first

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so that chord rolls after the first

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.870 
so that chord rolls after the first
chords<00:02:09.760> so<00:02:10.179> far<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.510> have

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.430 

the<00:02:14.390> next<00:02:14.630> chord<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.960> hammered<00:02:18.320> on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the next chord is it's a hammered on

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.740 
the next chord is it's a hammered on
chord<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.130> just<00:02:19.370> basically<00:02:19.600> take<00:02:20.600> your

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
chord you just basically take your

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.530 
chord you just basically take your
finger<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.170> place<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.800> across<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.090> top<00:02:23.090> three

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540

strings<00:02:25.360> hammer<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.570> onto<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.930> 4th<00:02:27.800> fret<00:02:28.760> at

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
strings hammer and onto that 4th fret at

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.750 
strings hammer and onto that 4th fret at
the<00:02:29.330> third<00:02:29.510> string<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.170> then<00:02:30.980> roll<00:02:31.550> through

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the third string and then roll through

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.530 
the third string and then roll through

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
we're gonna be at the top so so that's

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.229 
we're gonna be at the top so so that's
that's<00:03:09.140> most<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.189> the<00:03:10.250> course<00:03:10.519> actually<00:03:10.849> also

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
that's most of the course actually also

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.899 
that's most of the course actually also
won't<00:03:11.720> get<00:03:11.870> into<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.349> part<00:03:12.590> two<00:03:12.799> but<00:03:13.489> now

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
won't get into that in part two but now

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:24.420 
won't get into that in part two but now
for<00:03:14.209> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.399 

that's<00:03:25.329> not<00:03:25.510> exactly<00:03:25.629> like<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.079> is<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.319> the

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
mind but just to go through it slowly

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.070 
and then there's a series of hammer ons
out<00:04:06.740> hammer<00:04:07.310> offs<00:04:07.640> after<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:11.020> sounds<00:04:12.020> like

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
out hammer offs after that sounds like

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.340 
out hammer offs after that sounds like
the<00:04:12.200> door<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.530> there<00:04:13.360> then<00:04:14.360> this<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.780> two

fingers both on the fifth and second

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.150 
fingers both on the fifth and second
spread

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.620 

that's<00:04:25.160> just<00:04:25.490> your<00:04:25.730> fingers<00:04:26.360> here<00:04:26.480> on<00:04:26.540> the
