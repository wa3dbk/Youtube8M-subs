00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 who monday today and we start the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.720
 week with the following topics when 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 actually appears research 2 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.690
 microsoft now has a set of rules for 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
 let's play published do force 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 talks about privacy on the internet 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.170
 And so life 2 helped a lot 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.760
 cool fan project publishes that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.760
 now deuce again 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 when does mirror's edge actually appear? 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.579
 2 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.680
 That's probably a question that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 at the moment there are a lot of players 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 because actually the title should first 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.620
 the hairs are so 2016 is on 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.940
 every case was a little bit down 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.129
 now always said but now there is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 new rumors rekindled the rumor mill 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 has to simmer and indeed has 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.860
 microsoft now in microsoft store the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 Release date of the xbox version for 2015 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.390
 indicated 2015 as I said actually 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 2016 so this is just a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 weird and people think so 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 when does the title appear and why did it appear? 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 Microsoft stated that because 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189
 Developers and publishers are dice and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.070
 electronic arts and they have so far 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.360
 actually officially known 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.740
 given, of course, can be 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.020
 that this is just one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.000
 platzhalter acts however it is 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 a bit odd weeks of now only 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.799
 has been published and why the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.570
 2015 and thereby 2016 shows that is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.520
 everything a little parent as I said one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.259
 There is no such thing as an opinion 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 from microsoft still from publisher or 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.299
 developer electronic arts or dice 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.710
 can of course be then then that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.880
 the riester in the back now just in 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.159
 the next hours or in the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.690
 No commentary next day 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.310
 what is your opinion about it 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 we get such a topic that 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.370
 actually not that much with 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 but I am the one to play 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.030
 opinion that we in the future then too 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.160
 more often youtube news 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.840
 to break in between just when 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.080
 maybe not so interesting games 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.760
 news like now available in january 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.050
 That's why I wanted this topic 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.970
 Let's talk about that 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.800
 in my opinion very important 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.500
 and that's why we will do it now 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.900
 Treat yourself within the news 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.640
 namely the driving force on youtuber 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.170
 his youtube-channel a new video 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.720
 uploaded and within this 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 video please the young person im 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.700
 internet to be more careful and indeed 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.530
 with the issue of personal 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.200
 private details such as name 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.080
 So first name last name old place of residence and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.850
 so on and so forth and that's why 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.180
 because he had a video or already 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 often streams looked at by several 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.240
 people have a lot of information 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.780
 has revealed in his example or 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.980
 Ireland 1 1 just right back to the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.570
 with a 15 year old girl 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.950
 Looked in dust two or three 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.080
 minutes and there he has in one of 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.030
 already two or three minutes ago name 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.670
 residence school age at which 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.459
 bus stop you get out and so on 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.260
 get out and about and so forth 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.300
 Mitte is really more cautious 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.070
 be with this information that one 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.480
 that does not just come out and 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.980
 many well-known youtubers like for example 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.070
 grund and hannibal have that too 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.800
 times the topic addressed or the video 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.510
 shared and asked for caution 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.400
 besides, of course, the parents are also 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.739
 in the responsibility with their children 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.150
 to talk about such a topic and him 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.350
 then maybe the video too 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.420
 I think that's really a show 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.860
 interesting topic that's why it came 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.820
 now here within the news and 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.580
 maybe that 'll just give me that 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.340
 continue or tigers or speak with 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.269
 your children if you have any 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.340
 we come to a really cool 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.769
 fanprojekt and to half life 2 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 I know you have currently very strong 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.159
 to be a helper then life 3 helped 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.420
 was still nothing 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.950
 announced you do not even know if the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.319
 title is ever in development 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.939
 right now that's why you have to be a fan 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.980
 yes somehow keep water that you can 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.019
 very cool with such impressive 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.220
 fan projects like this one the culprit 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.349
 probably in the background 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.379
 is called half life 2 in real life and 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.670
 is from the youtuber took part has 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.109
 the question was asked how would it be 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.720
 actually look when the comma is 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.340
 conquer the world as we would 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.650
 So today, the world knows the world today 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.909
 conquer would that yes definitely 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.829
 very interesting and that's what he shows 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.840
 within a video and that is 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.519
 a combination of real scenes and 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.720
 play elements should you on 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.730
 look at any case times and perhaps 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.200
 Maybe it will help 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.970
 Sometime weak and then there are times 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.060
 the announcement 253 I would be on everyone 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.410
 celebrate extremely 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.239
 apparently also microsoft has slow 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.090
 heard that let's play offs and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.280
 let's play quite useful just as 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.169
 Marketing possibilities stop free 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.810
 to make advertising for your own games 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.659
 and now microsoft is really comfortable 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.330
 learned and a proper set of rules 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.010
 for let's play published and that 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.620
 for youtube and the streaming service 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.120
 You can twitter a little now 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.490
 orientate it 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.810
 and yes for example just for 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.630
 producers who also like or 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.289
 Video producers like their videos 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.659
 this is definitely monetization 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.250
 quite interesting because quite honest many 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.780
 youtuber would like a little bit 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.370
 make money with their videos because if 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.440
 you put the work in then you want 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.389
 maybe a bit for that, yes 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.490
 to be compensated financially , I say 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.050
 Now just like that 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.780
 Microsoft also stresses that you look around 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.360
 the music has to take care of itself so if 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.159
 if for example pieces of music 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.919
 inside of these videos are in it 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.539
 for example when you're at gta with 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.130
 the author environment and the music is listening 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.630
 of course no microsoft your work only 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.180
 as an an example 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.889
 and that's why you should be careful 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.409
 because certain songs are for use 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.030
 were licensed in the game and one 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.860
 publishing within one 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.650
 Of course, then displays on youtube can 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.720
 lead to content id matches and 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.270
 you want that as youtuber yes anyway 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.400
 not yes there is a relatively long time 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.979
 list so you can have a long time 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.990
 list of the rules and you can 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.789
 you look at xbox.com or the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.830
 summary at play nation under 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.440
 Other things you should not change in the 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.360
 play so except is there 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.520
 probably a minecraft like that 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.050
 looks exactly I do not know should 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.699
 then you have a closer look 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.720
 perhaps microsoft is also still 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.060
 something to say 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.139
 also you should with his video 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.539
 then do not give the impression 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.460
 that this is official video 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.930
 material from microsoft acts 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.880
 should be clear 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.949
 and i think it's cool that microsoft 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.539
 now synonymous has responded to the 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.520
 let's play off displays has responded and 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.830
 that you are last and as 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.260
 publisher years little more on each other 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.300
 to moving basically has indeed every page 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.919
 something that makes a side 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.400
 free advertising for the game of 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.990
 Microsoft in this case and Microsoft 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.539
 then just give these games or give 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.830
 then the material for it or does that 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.710
 material available 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.660
 and I hope that in the future easy 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.190
 even more happens and that's let's play 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.780
 as maybe a little easier 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.639
 then to earn money with it 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.230
 well my opinion what is your opinion 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.660
 to 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.190
 that was hughes to the monday i wish 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.490
 Of course you have a beautiful one 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.530
 week 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.910
 your opinion, of course, below 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.560
 of the video in the comments 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.100
 and I would say that by the time of 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:00.010
 next news until tomorrow then appears 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:03.590
 Actually , we do not know any idea 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:06.790
 bam bam bam bam test is it is that 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.790
 black sheep good
