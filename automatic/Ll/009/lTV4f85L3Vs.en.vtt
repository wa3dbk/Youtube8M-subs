00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.139
 the thai strain looks indeed 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.090
 bringing more and more rogge video 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.699
 this episode is bringing two piers 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.830
 that the two mice are also the same 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.080
 creator are very similar 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.260
 and I think the two are compatible 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.699
 but I will not use the two together 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 a means of working the effect of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.739
 Other then it will be very fast 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230
 I hope you like timÃ³teo 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.719
 a great professional legal aesthetic 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 so you do not see one last minecraft 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:57.300
 institutional exchange stripecke some 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:02.329
 gaps in the blue color of the Basque already 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.329
 You'll say it's a different static to 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:23.299
 not be pretty quick here we show the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.299
 potato 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 he was in the clip aaa 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.720
 when he never dies like 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.810
 he will pay the local invoices will go 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:49.979
 run out of soil for a while 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 now let's show this with a good show 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 happens 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.640
 besides they molded blood 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.939
 I really liked the movie Pedro. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.310
 separated when he dies is also 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.280
 editor who inventory eyes on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.890
 disappear his head will be yours 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.340
 Otherwise it will not take my work a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.500
 bit but I think maybe grantor 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.520
 in the next year 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:24.860
 here's a custom zombie will be fine 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.530
 calm and show that it's very slow 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.520
 Look how a zombie crashed all over 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.959
 day I can even push the sport yet 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.830
 will stand there 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:42.560
 only that it will release the blood is the Sumbe 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:49.550
 skeleton which is what I think is cooler 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:55.910
 It's today for the joy of him. 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.750
 past the thump on the look he just goes 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.580
 break and will give up to you see inside 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.600
 of the cells, it was really cool 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:16.790
 so it's this mold to come back now 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:19.340
 another way back will be the mobi and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.980
 so let's go here I'm going to be negative 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:30.350
 even to show him that not always 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:33.260
 You can make it very clear that this time I do not 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.360
 happened is not always going to happen 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.170
 I was studying little now in another 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.489
 world botox is and sometimes does not happen 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.269
 so it's best to stay in the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.269
 what on your cell phone 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:57.489
 Look at Brazil, it flew by 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.489
 block and try the spokesman now in the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:11.540
 Night seems like it is Brazil is there 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.370
 leaving I know that gives to head as not 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.579
 nothing came out of the skeleton now 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.329
 let's try again lets make ours 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.329
 he will stay 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:30.500
 missing one arm of Kelly's two brook 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.289
 whites want bras 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.270
 hence an arm also look gauge 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.550
 saints now here in the zombie 40 show the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.889
 volume falls on the head 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.840
 Look, he looks like this, he's going to stay. 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.630
 and video 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.800
 He died alone. 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.800
 fact that he has his head 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.300
 I think it was the cape of the island where 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.500
 people hit more because the zombie head 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.789
 what's up guys 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.970
 this was the biggest protest along with the 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.979
 mobile again remembering that it looks 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.780
 telltale that they will be 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:18.319
 separated in the institution as it was 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.409
 two more are really I think the 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.159
 two share looks I do not think 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.440
 I'm sure it's a motto, but I 'll leave it. 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:31.070
 and dance like the look of a 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.180
 poll and there is a modus heavy thing 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.759
 of the type 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.060
 Many thanks for watching the numbers. 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.060
