00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.609
 How about buying a plot of land on the moon? 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.970
 already imagined you can county her house she on the street 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.710
 if you want to know more about the action 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.070
 we are here to introduce you to a new opportunity in your life 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 it's starting but the observatory 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.430
 until January 2007 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.440
 ten percent of the 10 million moon cars 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.829
 sold by the company with these pib 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.830
 was bought by 10,000 Israelis 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.979
 to buy but have not entered this site 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.210
 and click here 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.250
 At this moment in time we have the squid 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.650
 after that a new screen appeared so you should provide your number 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.080
 credit card to compare some actors 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.160
 only for the presence of 49 euros 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.530
 so you would already have 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.780
 with a little piece of ground there on the moon 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.700
 the biggest problem for many Brazilians without understanding what was written in the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.810
 site since the sale was located on the Israeli site 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.540
 What are your problems? 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.509
 as always with a simple internet search 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.299
 you can go to medical sites for years 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.360
 which also sells with piece on the moon 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.230
 the biggest problem for these buyers will be the trip to the moon 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.990
 See Nasa has investment plans says 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.430
 hundred million dollars until 2018 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 to build a lunar base without counting other hundreds of billions who invade 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 releases and other details that involve the project 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.990
 letting go of the joke 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.970
 the fact is that it is not allowed 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.210
 the sale of any celestial object including therein 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.969
 we want to ensure this 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.460
 here is the treatise and principles of the united nations on the other space 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:01.580
 terrestrial 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.130
 this treaty was signed in 1967 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 and has 75 pages 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.090
 was ratified in 2006 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.259
 by 98 countries as we can see month has image here 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.370
 realize that countries in yellow 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.909
 are those who just sign the green little treaty we have the countries 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.539
 who signed on rats that were treated 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.789
 already the countries and gray 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.380
 these indices here 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.649
 do not sign the agreement 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.219
 in the space treatise of 1967 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.100
 there is a specific part 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.740
 on the exploration and use of the moon in its orbit involving issues 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.469
 economic 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.899
 scientific and nuclear 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.649
 example, the fourth paragraph of Article 4 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.109
 exploitation 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.989
 all mankind and will be for the benefit of 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.460
 all countries 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.709
 regardless of your economic situation 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.209
 and also scientific 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.950
 still in Article 11 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.929
 two paragraphs where I believe he 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:10.829
 the squid 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.630
 these natural resources 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.529
 are common equity 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.999
 of puberty 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.130
 and also want 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.230
 the squid can not be the object of national appropriation 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.029
 not to mention that it is not allowed 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.969
 no kind of construction who passes by there in the access of all 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.630
 and what case 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.800
 changes in the middle of nowhere or let's take a break and thought it was 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.969
 a little better 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.079
 if you happen to want to build the orchard 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.579
 marry there on the street 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.700
 no use you will not be the sole owner of it 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.280
 because everyone inside will be able to paint that leave your house 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.660
 therefore 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.590
 we can realize that the sale 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.829
 like any other celestial body 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.490
 it's forbidden 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.779
 at least for us Terrans 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.069
 and that this type of trade is illegal 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.800
 without regard to 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 that the name of the virtual store no longer expects a compensation 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.330
 after all 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.010
 the secondary is something in a store called 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.979
 crazy shop 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.559
 this disease 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.569
 we arrived at the end of another whimsical observatory any doubt 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.150
 any suggestion email us astronomical moment to steal 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.630
 climatempo point with br 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.639
 a big hug 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 and until the next program 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.240
 the promoter
