00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
a little while but I don't tend to

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.680 
a little while but I don't tend to
update<00:00:12.710> as<00:00:12.890> much<00:00:13.220> as<00:00:13.490> it<00:00:13.610> does<00:00:13.790> take<00:00:14.210> a<00:00:14.420> while

for<00:00:14.720> the<00:00:14.960> Ness<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.140> really<00:00:15.440> grow<00:00:15.800> and<00:00:16.160> be

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
for the Ness to really grow and be

for the Ness to really grow and be
established<00:00:17.330> soon<00:00:17.599> if<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:18.169> update<00:00:18.320> it<00:00:18.589> very

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800

often<00:00:18.980> seriously<00:00:19.939> nothing<00:00:20.119> would<00:00:20.359> really

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
often seriously nothing would really

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.140 
often seriously nothing would really
change<00:00:21.039> if<00:00:22.039> you<00:00:22.279> remember<00:00:22.640> in<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> last<00:00:22.909> video

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150

the Queen and work had started to build
a<00:00:25.550> little<00:00:25.909> nest<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.659> it<00:00:26.810> kind<00:00:27.019> of<00:00:27.079> looked<00:00:27.259> like

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
a little nest and it kind of looked like

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.929 
a little nest and it kind of looked like
a<00:00:27.380> curve<00:00:27.769> in<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.399> soil

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
a curve in the soil

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.250 
a curve in the soil
well<00:00:29.720> now<00:00:29.929> that<00:00:30.319> nest<00:00:30.619> looks<00:00:30.890> like<00:00:31.069> this<00:00:32.260> it's

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
well now that nest looks like this it's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.720 
well now that nest looks like this it's
hard<00:00:33.380> to<00:00:33.620> see<00:00:33.800> what<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.129> Queen<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.519> the<00:00:34.579> work

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
hard to see what the Queen and the work

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.220 
hard to see what the Queen and the work
is<00:00:34.879> getting<00:00:35.000> up<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.449> an<00:00:35.570> air<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:35.960> where<00:00:36.109> the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
is getting up to an air and where the

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.560 
is getting up to an air and where the
larva<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.739> if<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.489> view<00:00:37.730> from<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.090> other<00:00:38.120> side

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
larva is if you view from the other side

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.509 
larva is if you view from the other side
of<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.809> tank<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:39.530> can<00:00:39.649> sort<00:00:39.949> of<00:00:40.039> see<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:40.399> it

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
of the tank you can sort of see that it

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.470 
of the tank you can sort of see that it
has<00:00:40.699> extended<00:00:41.239> along<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:42.199> bit<00:00:43.239> as<00:00:44.239> well

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
has extended along a little bit as well

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.329 
has extended along a little bit as well
as<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:44.719> extension<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.440> decided<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.129> update

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
as this extension I decided to update

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.880 
as this extension I decided to update
that<00:00:46.699> magnifying<00:00:47.570> pot<00:00:47.929> because<00:00:48.260> everything<00:00:48.769> I

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
put in there went mouldy and to be

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.709 
put in there went mouldy and to be
honest<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.140> little<00:00:51.230> bit<00:00:51.530> boring<00:00:51.859> so<00:00:52.480> I<00:00:53.480> bought

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
honest a little bit boring so I bought

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.750 
honest a little bit boring so I bought
this<00:00:53.899> tub<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.499> drilled<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.010> hole<00:00:55.039> in<00:00:55.429> the<00:00:55.550> side

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
this tub and drilled a hole in the side

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.599 
this tub and drilled a hole in the side
to<00:00:56.269> feed<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.539> cheap<00:00:56.780> fruit<00:00:57.019> I<00:00:57.399> then<00:00:58.399> added

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
to feed the cheap fruit I then added

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.369 
to feed the cheap fruit I then added
some<00:00:58.760> rocks<00:00:59.179> in<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.719> bottom<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.109> help<00:01:00.260> with

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
some rocks in the bottom to help with

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.720 
some rocks in the bottom to help with
drainage<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:02.079> then<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.320> added<00:01:03.499> some<00:01:03.649> wet<00:01:04.280> eco

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
drainage and then I added some wet eco

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.390 
drainage and then I added some wet eco
wife's<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.030> had<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:05.330> lying<00:01:05.570> around<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.800> some

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
seeds to be honest I don't think they're

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.450 
seeds to be honest I don't think they're
going<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.080> do<00:01:09.260> much<00:01:09.530> but<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.890> know<00:01:09.980> whatever

going to do much but you know whatever

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.660 
going to do much but you know whatever
put<00:01:10.730> them<00:01:10.820> in<00:01:11.320> then<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.350> added<00:01:12.770> some<00:01:12.920> dry<00:01:13.280> eco

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
put them in then I added some dry eco

wife<00:01:13.850> which<00:01:14.150> was<00:01:14.180> mix<00:01:14.540> of<00:01:14.720> sand<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:15.410> came

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
wife which was mix of sand that came

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.990 
wife which was mix of sand that came
with<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.220> set<00:01:16.430> up<00:01:16.550> originally<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:19.000> then

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
with the set up originally and then

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.580 
with the set up originally and then
added<00:01:20.330> some<00:01:20.360> things<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.900> found<00:01:21.050> in<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.320> garden

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
added some things I found in the garden

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.710 
added some things I found in the garden
which<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.520> ads<00:01:22.640> are<00:01:22.820> probably<00:01:23.120> naturally

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
which the ads are probably naturally

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.310 
which the ads are probably naturally
encounter<00:01:24.350> such<00:01:24.650> as<00:01:24.860> rocks<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.670> twigs<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.450> an

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
encounter such as rocks and twigs and an

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.010 
encounter such as rocks and twigs and an
empty<00:01:27.800> snail<00:01:28.160> shell<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.270> great<00:01:29.510> thing<00:01:29.810> about

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
empty snail shell the great thing about

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.890 
empty snail shell the great thing about
all<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.520> own<00:01:31.730> rain<00:01:32.330> system

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
all of this is is this own rain system

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.230 
all of this is is this own rain system
and<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> plot<00:01:34.490> doesn't<00:01:34.640> really<00:01:34.880> dry<00:01:35.060> out

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
and so the plot doesn't really dry out

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.970 
and so the plot doesn't really dry out
and<00:01:35.510> that<00:01:35.870> means<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.170> don't<00:01:36.230> have<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.530> worry<00:01:36.740> too

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
and that means I don't have to worry too

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.030 
and that means I don't have to worry too
much<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.370> outs<00:01:37.550> are<00:01:37.760> going<00:01:37.880> dehydrate

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
much that the outs are going dehydrate

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.070 
much that the outs are going dehydrate
food<00:01:40.040> wise<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:41.000> offered<00:01:41.210> crickets<00:01:41.780> and

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
food wise I have offered crickets and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.110 
food wise I have offered crickets and
honey<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.710> everything<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.220> don't<00:01:43.280> tend<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.000> see

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
honey and everything I don't tend to see

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.990 
honey and everything I don't tend to see
them<00:01:44.420> eating<00:01:44.660> all<00:01:45.050> really<00:01:45.830> emerging<00:01:46.340> from<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
them eating all really emerging from the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.790 
them eating all really emerging from the
nest<00:01:47.300> so<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.630> do<00:01:47.810> hope<00:01:48.200> they're<00:01:48.440> eating

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
nest so I do hope they're eating

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.520 
nest so I do hope they're eating
otherwise<00:01:49.160> I'm<00:01:49.430> gonna<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.700> big<00:01:49.910> problem

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
otherwise I'm gonna have a big problem
