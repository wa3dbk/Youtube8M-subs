launcher<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.630> there<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:48.900> three<00:02:49.260> rocket

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
launcher and there are three rocket

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.830 
launcher and there are three rocket
launchers<00:02:50.100> i<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:50.700> depending<00:02:51.690> on

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
launchers i like to use depending on

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.750

what<00:02:52.020> primary<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> special<00:02:53.070> weapon<00:02:53.340> i<00:02:53.400> use<00:02:53.580> in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
what primary and special weapon i use in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.330 
what primary and special weapon i use in
but<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.360> first<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:55.080> gala<00:02:55.410> horn<00:02:55.739> purely

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
but the first is my gala horn purely

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.670 
but the first is my gala horn purely
because<00:02:56.520> when<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.360> fire<00:02:57.690> around<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.440> will

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
because when you fire around it will

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
because when you fire around it will
track<00:02:59.010> its<00:02:59.340> enemy<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> follow<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.630> wherever

track its enemy and follow it wherever
it<00:03:01.650> moves<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.190> once<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.850> hit<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.450> enemy<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
it moves and once it's hit the enemy the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
it moves and once it's hit the enemy the
shell<00:03:04.830> explodes<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.670> creates<00:03:06.030> cluster<00:03:06.510> bombs

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
shell explodes and creates cluster bombs

shell explodes and creates cluster bombs
which<00:03:07.170> also<00:03:07.440> damage<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.070> enemy<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:08.700> i<00:03:09.120> don't

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
which also damage the enemy if i don't

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.970 
which also damage the enemy if i don't
use<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> gala<00:03:09.870> horn<00:03:10.170> i<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.830> use<00:03:10.860> my

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
dragons breath purely because when the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930 
dragons breath purely because when the
rocket<00:03:13.290> detonates<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.040> creates<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.520> solar

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
rocket detonates it creates a solar

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.680 
rocket detonates it creates a solar
