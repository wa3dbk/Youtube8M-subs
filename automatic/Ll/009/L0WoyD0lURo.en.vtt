and the texture of the laptop the whole
thing<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.560> been<00:01:46.740> designed<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.390> top<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
thing has been designed in a top of

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050 
better as we go down and down the bottom
we<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.740> nice<00:01:58.790> textured<00:01:59.790> feel

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
we have the little nice textured feel

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.350 
we have the little nice textured feel
which<00:02:00.899> also<00:02:01.860> does<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.729> attract<00:02:03.180> any

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
which also does not attract any

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.260 
which also does not attract any
fingerprints<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.990> feels<00:02:07.290> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
fingerprints and it feels kind of like a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
had to put the equalizer right up so we

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.330 
had to put the equalizer right up so we
can<00:03:42.940> hear<00:03:43.060> something<00:03:43.480> out<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.720> him<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.340> they

when I was doing the other review of the
earlier<00:03:59.980> model<00:04:00.370> when<00:04:01.060> he<00:04:01.150> did<00:04:01.330> press<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.630> key

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
earlier model when he did press the key

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.040 
earlier model when he did press the key
in<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.170> middle<00:04:02.290> there<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.830> can<00:04:03.010> feel<00:04:03.340> that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
in the middle there you can feel that

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.360 
in the middle there you can feel that
some<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.230> keys<00:04:05.440> around<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:06.100> were

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
some of the keys around that were

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.430 
some of the keys around that were
pushing<00:04:06.730> down<00:04:07.060> as<00:04:07.209> well<00:04:07.450> but<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:08.380> time

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
pushing down as well but this time

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.740 
pushing down as well but this time
around<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:09.130> much<00:04:09.400> more<00:04:09.580> sturdy<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.150> more<00:04:10.450> firm

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
below but nevertheless you can you will

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.390 
below but nevertheless you can you will
get<00:07:13.020> used<00:07:13.229> thought<00:07:13.440> after<00:07:13.770> all<00:07:13.800> are<00:07:14.070> so<00:07:14.280> it's

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 
get used thought after all are so it's

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.090 
get used thought after all are so it's
not<00:07:14.550> a<00:07:14.610> big<00:07:14.790> problem<00:07:17.870> well<00:07:18.870> I<00:07:19.229> have<00:07:19.740> a<00:07:19.770> look<00:07:20.010> at

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
not a big problem well I have a look at

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.520 
not a big problem well I have a look at
the<00:07:20.220> lid<00:07:20.430> also<00:07:21.120> the<00:07:21.690> lid<00:07:21.930> has<00:07:22.139> the<00:07:22.320> same

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
the lid also the lid has the same

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.090 
the lid also the lid has the same
textured<00:07:23.040> field<00:07:23.370> as<00:07:23.610> the<00:07:24.740> touchpad<00:07:25.740> as<00:07:25.889> well

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
textured field as the touchpad as well

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.320 
textured field as the touchpad as well
so<00:07:26.430> you<00:07:26.490> won't<00:07:26.760> be<00:07:26.850> getting<00:07:26.970> many

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
so you won't be getting many
