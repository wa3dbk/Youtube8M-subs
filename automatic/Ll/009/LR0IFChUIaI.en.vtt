00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.830
 wayne watts everyone welcome on 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.200
 this video the mates 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.700
 I hope you are well so this is 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.619
 Friday a charming portage on 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.360
 really just job is friday 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.430
 and you know it Friday is the day 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.020
 two measures so jury is right 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.570
 here on the tower you go to the right 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.099
 are doomed to the person so stands on 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.440
 agent of 9 that we have on this 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.000
 week the falling shit 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.590
 and yes shit you see this big 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.700
 poop the screen a lip lightening but 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.890
 good they're still shit huh 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.320
 I warn you so let's go for 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.929
 the title in front of the cranial fortress 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 so the frags realized with the corner of 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.390
 the storm regenerates your life points 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.070
 appeared to them energy of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.030
 melee attacks or allah you 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.649
 recover hit points that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.789
 picks up and an orb and attacks from 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.829
 ordinary way the energy of the crosnes 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.059
 with a lot of discipline where we do not 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.199
 do not know the best of times what a 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.820
 for the titles yesterday a lot better 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.929
 frankly I think that in the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.269
 Titan players there are very few who 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.949
 this case what really has then the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.750
 rapier lucky for the hunter 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.690
 with a lot of intelligence so that one 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 here it is there is not bad yet 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.630
 maybe for pvp the art pomegranate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.979
 and percussion with a larger area 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.550
 are going to appear with energy from 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.560
 grenade 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.000
 it increases the ammunition capacity of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.620
 heavy weapons increases the capacity in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.970
 ammunition fusion guns then 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.980
 separated in the hunters frankly 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.480
 I do not see much who wears who 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.590
 wears chest 1 but hey that's it 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.510
 yeah that's not good 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 then for the ti for the organism 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.970
 during the veil of apotheosis so a 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.430
 hard hat with a lot of discipline 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.020
 also melee attacks regenerates 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.010
 the energy of the grenades you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.050
 recover life points 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.090
 picks up huge and your life points are 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.190
 regenerated when you activate your 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.780
 super gold if it seems there are still a lot 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.790
 better for the organisms but really 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.020
 after it's a good helmet for those who 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.250
 want to do their is croo pta who 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.660
 start a little games etc 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.980
 but otherwise frankly there are a lot 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.170
 better here it is really not terrible 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.000
 this week even less terrible 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.350
 atheist universal commands so this is a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.940
 kind of fund wholesale it's a rifle to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.630
 pump that is done in the weapon slot 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.520
 main 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.720
 so it's really not so good 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.730
 ability to bring precision 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.810
 increases if you use the pattern the 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.160
 prag realized with seven years you 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.000
 temporarily inflate 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.650
 additional damage 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.700
 so I say it's not so good because 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.379
 that I am a weapon I do not like 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.330
 I know that was born appreciating pvp 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.040
 here in pvp there is still well 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.690
 now as more like the rifle to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.400
 pump him and frankly there are a lot 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.170
 better if not this week as 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.159
 find exotic ram language for this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.659
 tale not every case this exotic 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.630
 this is still the small point 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.680
 positive 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 you can buy a shine for 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.490
 improve your exotic equipment but 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.020
 good this I think for the biggest 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.280
 that they are now using as 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.710
 usually you will find ammunition 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.110
 heavy against a strange piece and I the 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.610
 repeat you can exchange your coins 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.290
 strange that particles of light 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.180
 which will allow you to be able to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.320
 bought 700 grams so that's for those 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.460
 who have a lot of pieces do not hesitate 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.680
 to be exchanged for particles of 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.970
 light I hope this video has you 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.170
 in any case, I repeat it again 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.340
 really what vang on this week 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.600
 it's really not good but I 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.210
 almost say it's shit 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.530
 finally here and it was not to leave your 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.640
 notice in the comments to see if 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840
 you really have the same opinion as me 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.800
 I leave you his friends take care of 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.800
