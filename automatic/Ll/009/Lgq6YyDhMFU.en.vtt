Cry<00:01:18.560> 3<00:01:18.730> now<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.790> cool<00:01:20.090> thing<00:01:20.120> about<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.780> is

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
Cry 3 now the cool thing about this is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.200 
Cry 3 now the cool thing about this is
they<00:01:21.350> actually<00:01:21.740> seem<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.010> be<00:01:22.280> pirated<00:01:22.790> copies

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
they actually seem to be pirated copies

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.120 
they actually seem to be pirated copies
and<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.630> reason<00:01:23.870> I<00:01:23.960> do<00:01:24.020> say<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.770> because

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
and the reason I do say this is because

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.160 
and the reason I do say this is because
they<00:01:25.250> are<00:01:25.370> not<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:25.730> normal<00:01:25.940> DVD<00:01:26.479> cases<00:01:26.780> games

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
they are not in normal DVD cases games

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.560 
they are not in normal DVD cases games
are<00:01:27.350> usually<00:01:27.500> sold<00:01:27.920> into<00:01:28.310> instead<00:01:29.000> researches

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
are usually sold into instead researches

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.109 
are usually sold into instead researches
in<00:01:29.750> normal<00:01:30.140> CD<00:01:30.500> cases<00:01:30.800> now<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.940> would

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
in normal CD cases now this would

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.910 
in normal CD cases now this would
actually<00:01:32.510> make<00:01:32.720> perfectly<00:01:33.170> good<00:01:33.260> sense<00:01:33.650> if

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
actually make perfectly good sense if

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.710 
actually make perfectly good sense if
these<00:01:34.100> are<00:01:34.340> pirated<00:01:34.790> copies<00:01:35.180> because<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
these are pirated copies because the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.660 
these are pirated copies because the
game<00:01:35.900> off<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.320> roll<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.650> about<00:01:36.680> tagging<00:01:37.490> and

and<00:01:44.810> he<00:01:45.229> probably<00:01:45.440> did<00:01:45.860> play<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> load<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.460> video

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
and he probably did play a load of video

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.490 
and he probably did play a load of video
games<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.210> maybe<00:01:47.450> he<00:01:47.630> still<00:01:47.840> does<00:01:47.900> up<00:01:48.350> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
games and maybe he still does up to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380 
games and maybe he still does up to
today<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.950> maybe<00:01:49.369> he<00:01:49.640> may<00:01:49.790> not<00:01:49.970> have<00:01:50.030> enough

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
today and maybe he may not have enough

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.820 
today and maybe he may not have enough
money<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.750> go<00:01:50.960> ahead<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.290> purchase<00:01:51.470> these

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
money to go ahead and purchase these

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.130 
money to go ahead and purchase these
games<00:01:52.130> legally<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.090> he<00:01:53.210> decided<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.690> use<00:01:53.780> his

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
games legally so he decided to use his

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.290 
games legally so he decided to use his
skills<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.590> get<00:01:54.800> them<00:01:54.979> for<00:01:55.190> free<00:01:55.250> because<00:01:56.060> in

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
skills and get them for free because in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.820 
skills and get them for free because in
all<00:01:56.420> honesty<00:01:56.450> if<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.290> take<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.470> look<00:01:57.680> at

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
all honesty if you just take a look at

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.710 
all honesty if you just take a look at
t-bone<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.369> can<00:01:58.550> instantly<00:01:58.970> tell<00:01:59.240> he<00:01:59.420> isn't

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
t-bone you can instantly tell he isn't

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.660 
t-bone you can instantly tell he isn't
really<00:01:59.990> wealthy<00:02:00.260> by<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.950> way<00:02:01.190> he<00:02:01.340> dresses

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
really wealthy by the way he dresses

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.220 
really wealthy by the way he dresses
with<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.090> bed<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.570> all<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.810> kind<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.140> stuff

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
with the bed and all that kind of stuff

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.380 
with the bed and all that kind of stuff
and<00:02:03.590> even<00:02:04.010> his<00:02:04.310> jeans<00:02:04.610> he<00:02:04.790> really<00:02:05.030> does<00:02:05.210> seem<00:02:05.360> a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
and even his jeans he really does seem a

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.000 
and even his jeans he really does seem a
bit<00:02:05.510> scruffy<00:02:05.900> at<00:02:06.350> least<00:02:06.500> us<00:02:06.680> in<00:02:06.830> my<00:02:06.980> opinion

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
bit scruffy at least us in my opinion

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.580 
bit scruffy at least us in my opinion
anyway<00:02:07.730> so<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:08.480> was<00:02:08.630> all<00:02:08.780> perform<00:02:09.200> he<00:02:09.350> made

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
anyway so this was all perform he made

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.710 
anyway so this was all perform he made
good<00:02:09.769> sense<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.429> now<00:02:11.000> recently<00:02:11.269> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
good sense and now recently the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.630 
good sense and now recently the
animation<00:02:12.290> director<00:02:12.470> Colin<00:02:13.190> gray<00:02:13.430> hem

animation director Colin gray hem

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.550 
animation director Colin gray hem
spotted<00:02:14.180> your<00:02:14.360> shockers<00:02:14.720> about<00:02:15.019> Wiz<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.260> he

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
spotted your shockers about Wiz and he

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.350 
spotted your shockers about Wiz and he
told<00:02:15.800> them<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.130> bows<00:02:16.340> are<00:02:16.550> really<00:02:16.940> legit

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
told them that bows are really legit

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.890 
told them that bows are really legit
copies

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
copies

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.890 
copies
apparently<00:02:18.530> t-bone<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.459> CD<00:02:19.880> cases<00:02:20.180> but

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
apparently t-bone just like CD cases but

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.449 
apparently t-bone just like CD cases but
from<00:02:21.140> my<00:02:21.290> point<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.590> view<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:21.980> think<00:02:22.430> that

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
from my point of view I do think that

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.100 
from my point of view I do think that
Colin<00:02:22.880> was<00:02:22.970> probably<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:23.600> joking<00:02:24.019> around

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
Colin was probably just joking around

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
Colin was probably just joking around
because<00:02:24.410> like<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:24.920> said<00:02:25.070> about<00:02:25.250> t-bone

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
because like you said about t-bone

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.130 
because like you said about t-bone
hacking<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.510> would<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:26.989> make

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
hacking this it would just make

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.870 
hacking this it would just make
perfectly<00:02:27.680> good<00:02:27.860> sense<00:02:28.070> I<00:02:28.280> mean<00:02:28.430> him<00:02:28.549> growing

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
perfectly good sense I mean him growing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.670 
perfectly good sense I mean him growing
up<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> basement<00:02:29.660> hacker<00:02:29.900> not<00:02:30.410> having

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
up as a basement hacker not having

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.170 
up as a basement hacker not having
enough<00:02:30.950> money<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.820> fit<00:02:32.030> in

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
enough money it would just fit in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.479 
enough money it would just fit in
perfectly<00:02:32.690> especially<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> game<00:02:34.220> being

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
perfectly especially with the game being

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.340 
perfectly especially with the game being
based<00:02:34.760> around<00:02:35.060> hacking<00:02:35.510> but<00:02:36.080> what<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:36.320> you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
based around hacking but what do you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.930 
based around hacking but what do you
guys<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.010> always<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.489> sure<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.790> let<00:02:37.880> me

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
guys think and always be sure to let me

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.310 
guys think and always be sure to let me
know<00:02:38.030> right<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:38.540> down<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.989> comments

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
know right now down in the comments

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.670 
know right now down in the comments
below

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
below

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.740 
below
so<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.370> did<00:02:40.700> actually<00:02:40.820> think<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.570> was<00:02:41.720> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
so I did actually think that this was a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750 
so I did actually think that this was a
prequel<00:02:42.200> Easter<00:02:42.620> Egg<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.250> actually<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
prequel Easter Egg and it's actually the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.340 
prequel Easter Egg and it's actually the
first<00:02:43.940> time<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.660> seen<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.870> far<00:02:45.140> cry

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
first time that we have seen a far cry

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.440 
first time that we have seen a far cry
free<00:02:45.739> Easter<00:02:46.190> egg<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> isn't<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.269> first

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
free Easter egg but it isn't the first

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.509 
free Easter egg but it isn't the first
time<00:02:47.720> for<00:02:48.019> an<00:02:48.110> assassin's<00:02:48.620> creed<00:02:48.950> Easter<00:02:49.340> egg

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
time for an assassin's creed Easter egg

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.850 
time for an assassin's creed Easter egg
so<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.269> few<00:02:50.570> months<00:02:50.840> ago<00:02:50.959> somebody<00:02:51.500> over<00:02:51.830> on

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
so a few months ago somebody over on

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.620 
so a few months ago somebody over on
where<00:02:52.160> they<00:02:52.250> actually<00:02:52.459> found<00:02:52.850> some<00:02:53.120> familiar

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
where they actually found some familiar

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.900 
where they actually found some familiar
elements<00:02:54.140> within<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.500> phone's<00:02:54.769> UI<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:55.790> if<00:02:55.850> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
elements within the phone's UI so if you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.100 
elements within the phone's UI so if you
take<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> look<00:02:56.299> at<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.510> bottom<00:02:56.810> left-hand

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
take a look at the bottom left-hand

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.110 
take a look at the bottom left-hand
corner<00:02:57.290> where<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> blue<00:02:58.370> icon<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.970> can

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
corner where it is the blue icon you can

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.580 
corner where it is the blue icon you can
see<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.540> doesn't<00:02:59.780> really<00:03:00.110> look<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
see it doesn't really look like the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.070 
see it doesn't really look like the
Assassin's<00:03:01.190> Creed<00:03:01.459> logo<00:03:01.940> yet<00:03:02.150> however<00:03:02.900> when

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
Assassin's Creed logo yet however when

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.430 
Assassin's Creed logo yet however when
you<00:03:03.170> turn<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.560> around<00:03:03.620> you

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you turn it around you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.590 
you turn it around you
this<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.340> definitely<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:06.030> looks<00:03:06.210> exactly

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
this and it definitely it looks exactly

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600 
this and it definitely it looks exactly
the<00:03:06.840> same<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> Assassin's<00:03:08.010> Creed<00:03:08.040> logo

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the same as the Assassin's Creed logo

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.030
