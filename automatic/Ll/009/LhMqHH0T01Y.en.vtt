 cube u25gt 4w tablet model 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.520
 Here is such a model. Well, let's see 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.400
 I will tell you to complete the kit 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.099
 even very poor it is the tablet itself 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.019
 user manual and beaten we take 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.860
 more and more with the tablet 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.149
 As for the tablet is such 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 model in a white color 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.579
 there is still black i ordered in white 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:49.100
 7 inch screen here so let's 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.789
 analyze ports here there is a mini-hdmi 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.489
 also input for charging here and 5 volts 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.129
 micro usb input 35 minijack button 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.690
 on and off 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.360
 and here's a slot for memory cards and here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.540
 such small boutiques and such a floor it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.799
 for removing the back cover in front of us 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 there is a camera 0 3 megapixels and that's it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.009
 of course, this is the Kiev logo and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 also dynamic so we have by ourselves 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.890
 Tablet on the filling here is available 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:35.610
 quad processor mtk 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 81 27 with a frequency of 1 and 3 and a heart each 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.020
 core also 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.070
 1 GB of RAM what else is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.369
 video accelerator here mali 450 m p 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.430
 standing here such as screen display is 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:00.740
 done and psdp matrix with resolution 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:05.240
 1024 by 600 points and 5 points of tangency 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.890
 Basically, I liked a good little screen 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.069
 here you go 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.620
 I think you can see that the screen is like you 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.330
 see good pro looks under any 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.209
 corners 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.320
 so well, let's go in antutu see 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.270
 on indicators antutu well here's antutu 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.470
 pointed at 18 thousand seven hundred eighty 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.040
 nine points 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.570
 that principle is a good good result i 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.110
 I think for this tablet so well by 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.280
 In principle, he said everything 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.400
 give even tell you what are the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.000
 there are sensors that are recoil directions 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.890
 there is a proximity sensor and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.140
 magnetic compass that's all 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600
 sensors 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.650
 so she remembers what we have from 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.739
 memory internal memory we have systems 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.340
 starevich is a courtyard and inner 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.080
 drive 4 is only 6 and in principle 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:15.820
 normal plus memory card support up to 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.820
 32 them that principle is not bad so 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.560
 what else to see with you is 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.560
 Interestingly 3d mark 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.630
 I then have not passed smoothly will not 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.820
 It will take a long time 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:40.400
 let's go into the game a little bit 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:44.170
 how does he behave in mind games and 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.170
 let's appreciate his speaker 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.730
 come on, come on 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.549
 because I have a little braking 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.580
 Of course, well, since this model we say 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.310
 so budget it is peculiar now 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.050
 It is loaded normally and should not 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.050
 be everyones hatch so 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:56.150
 you hear the speaker this is the maximum 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.150
 the volume is not very loud 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.729
 you see when braking principle no 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.639
 while it is loading and may be small 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:19.939
 hand so to speak with a sound that's attributed 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:19.939
 not bad is the way out leads essentially uncle 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:28.639
 so I think everything is clear that you are toys 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.509
 can they both play so well 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.159
 what else is 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.120
 interesting can be said about this 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:40.159
 tablet battery battery here 2400 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.479
 Milliampere hours that principle is not bad 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:45.779
 for 7 inch tablet 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.650
 that is, it will normally keep for a long time 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.349
 what image do u work 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.069
 let's look at the image with you 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:06:02.650
 on standard 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:06:06.620
 Here is such a color rendering 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.240
 see when scrolling through there are 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.240
 small hands 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.380
 video now watch video with you 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.680
 chinese go away 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.300
 this presentation is probably peak yes 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.419
 windows unity think everything is clear sound 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.940
 normal 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.310
 video, too, the principle goes well 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.660
 Here is such a tablet 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.180
 if you like the video review put

 tablets also smartphones and other 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.789
 gadgets 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:11.069
