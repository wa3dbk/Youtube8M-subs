as<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.230> said<00:00:52.789> this<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> command<00:00:54.449> it's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
as I just said this is the command it's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.160

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
have which is zero in pretty much all

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
have which is zero in pretty much all
the<00:01:11.820> cases<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> unbreakable

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the cases because you want a unbreakable

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
the cases because you want a unbreakable
sword<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.760> doesn't<00:01:15.180> really

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
sword so it actually doesn't really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.370 
sword so it actually doesn't really
matter<00:01:15.689> anyway<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.759> here's<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> important

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
matter anyway and here's the important

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
matter anyway and here's the important
command<00:01:19.710> after<00:01:20.369> all<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.540> have

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
command after all of this you will have

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.910 
command after all of this you will have
the<00:01:22.409> curly<00:01:22.830> brackets<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.299> type

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
the curly brackets and then type

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
the curly brackets and then type
unbreakable<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.610> capital<00:01:27.090> u<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> give

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
unbreakable with the capital u and give

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.310 
unbreakable with the capital u and give
it<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> value<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.150> actually<00:01:30.900> didn't

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it the value of one I actually didn't

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130 
it the value of one I actually didn't
find<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.829> anywhere<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.790> tried<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
find this anywhere I just tried it and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
find this anywhere I just tried it and
because<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.100> couldn't<00:01:35.430> find<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:38.189> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
because I couldn't find it so I was very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.039 
because I couldn't find it so I was very
lucky<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> right<00:01:39.659> command

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
lucky that this was the right command

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.580 
lucky that this was the right command
and<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:41.189> nothing<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.600> mob<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.259> do

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and it's nothing like the mob that do

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.700 
and it's nothing like the mob that do
not<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:44.189> spawned<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:46.079> command<00:01:46.470> for

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
not be spawned because the command for

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.679 
not be spawned because the command for
this<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.899> persistence<00:01:48.899> required<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
this is persistence required it is a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.670 
this is persistence required it is a
normal<00:01:52.229> summoning<00:01:52.710> command<00:01:53.070> summon<00:01:53.759> skeleton

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
normal summoning command summon skeleton

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
normal summoning command summon skeleton
right<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.869> persistence<00:01:57.869> required<00:01:58.770> one

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
right there and persistence required one

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.630 
right there and persistence required one
so<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.420> demonstrate<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.369> going

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so if we demonstrate this we are going

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.440 
so if we demonstrate this we are going
we<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> coordinate<00:02:04.469> 1000<00:02:05.250> 1000<00:02:06.240> if

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
we are at to the coordinate 1000 1000 if

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.219 
we are at to the coordinate 1000 1000 if
we<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:08.250> thousand<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.239> hundred<00:02:09.270> blocks<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
we go to thousand two hundred blocks to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.160 
we go to thousand two hundred blocks to
this<00:02:10.379> side<00:02:11.959> today

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this side today

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.100 
this side today
said<00:02:13.500> Cornett<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.880> mob<00:02:15.120> should<00:02:15.480> immediately

have not so this is a really useful

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.699 
have not so this is a really useful
