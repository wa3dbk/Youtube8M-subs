00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.000
 every year 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.000
 ah 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780
 closed 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.730
 very good afternoon gentleman welcome 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.720
 to elegant chicken the specialty of today 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.720
 obvious birth 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 Excuse me in the photo, that's how I've been 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.890
 chosen employee of the month during 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300
 last five months 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 interesting interesting its sickly 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.380
 sick eyes work addiction 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.960
 addiction not as you think you have no partner 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.610
 it is true that good to leave a partner not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.129
 but I know an evening that is the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 Platonic loves does not count then not 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.309
 solves the work has been the best 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.940
 way that I found to deal with the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.420
 absence of a couple, obviously of the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420
 same organism 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.990
 they are wrong I am not that kind of person 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.370
 the fact does not have to be ashamed 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.170
 that masturbates is something completely 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.240
 healthy and natural and pajero what if 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.000
 I recommend the suggestion of the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 Interesting interesting chef again 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.540
 I recommend a suggestion that is not 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.430
 his but it is the suggestion of chile 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.430
 that denotes insecurity and low self-esteem 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.909
 but probably because of a mother 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:39.170
 dominant and severely hawk poses 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.050
 radio in fact my mother was a woman 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.480
 totally liberated is what killed him 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.410
 up to 5 years old but that has nothing 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.240
 what to do with what they are up to 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.070
 it even takes him to school up to sixth 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.230
 but it was that they were dangerous times and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.120
 is justifying his classic mother of 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.940
 an overprotected son as he says in 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.300
 less orthodox terms with child of 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.450
 marketing themselves but I'm not like that 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.220
 negation 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 look gentleman excuse the term but 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.819
 if you are going to get that kind of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 stupid conclusions in your head only 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.330
 because I recommended the suggestion of the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 chef then let me recommend what 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 that I would choose in this perfect case 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.160
 we have lamas and we have an omelette to the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 diabla that is what personally 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.209
 like none are we talking about 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.459
 the psychosexual problems of cassava 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.290
 I'm here Perez Gerardo, this is not the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.989
 moment or the place to talk about their 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.580
 personal problems 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.050
 indigenous but he thought it 's enough 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.850
 nothing the kitchen 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 we have to talk about interest 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.250
 interesting already capture action speak 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.120
 of taboo taboos implies a severe and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.980
 deep repressed repression 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.060
 very probably because of a father 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.620
 abusive and absurd plaintiff and waiter 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.620
 he is nothing but a victim of his father 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.540
 because you project your childhood on him 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.730
 so that's why he treats me like shit 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.099
 it's not what you buy in everything 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.890
 for a need for sick attention 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.900
 that there is no homophobic reaction you no longer 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.519
 It does more than hide its latent 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 homosexual desires 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.930
 I'm not gay sure 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.920
 because they cry men do not cry 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 weeping 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.200
 sorry because he questions masculinity 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.830
 based on the crying 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.730
 it's because his father educated him like that, sir 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.700
 because that's how I'm your client 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.710
 and a free therapy for all of them 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.570
 56 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.570
 now armchairs thank you sir 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.870
 There is something you can do to alleviate your 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.870
 pain 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.570
 which
