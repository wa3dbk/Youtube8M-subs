00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.440
 hello welcome on the tutorials of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.080
 beagle today let's do the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.390
 juice to do the work 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 today we need three 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.720
 oil paintings 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.919
 we are going to take earth from aude 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.210
 natural of the earth which burned from the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:37.570
 sienna burned with gasoline f 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.100
 and you get some brushes so 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.260
 go to the dish and 1 finally pass once 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.400
 that you have her products you 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.560
 start taking your flat brush to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.230
 soak it in your sncf and 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.250
 began to pass on your armored to 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.640
 the location where you want 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.269
 exactly position of both 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.820
 cities so here we go dijonnais we get 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.020
 do no more by doing like that 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.079
 introduce you to your colors 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.229
 which is already a good point at the 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.210
 of the camouflage so you take 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.020
 your first brush that is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 extremely fine we find it a bit in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 the senses we just dip him in the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.990
 land of a big loser my natural 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:37.330
 we take a point we come well on 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:39.640
 wet and we're going to apply to 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.890
 level of strategic points 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 you see there I start to ask around 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.619
 brackets of the brackets to hold him 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.350
 then we take his brush we come 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.270
 attracting one will say one gives will be an effect 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.159
 which suits you of course there is more or 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.750
 less and tries to do so 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.330
 for me there I am not satisfied enough 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.470
 it does not like me the expected effect so 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.980
 I will leave with the land of 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.459
 his burned 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.010
 so we redo the same operation 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:27.830
 comes to deceive him into the essence f and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:31.569
 you come to ask your products then 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.569
 you come to shoot 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.849
 you continue this operation on 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.590
 all the locations where you want 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:48.670
 mark we see a little laroui there we 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:53.380
 saw was Thursday give hardly to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:59.410
 level of the lighthouse at my brush and I 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.030
 pulls on the sides we are clear 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.930
 said camouflage we see it extremely 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.980
 well when I started painting I 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.620
 makes a few mistakes at the level of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.090
 Camouflage we see a bit of no effect 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.880
 that you can catch up very well 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:23.470
 with your juice that you are going to do 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.310
 to carve no problem 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.310
 this is a first step 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.370
 so you want to make some runs on 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.129
 your level of turrets you take 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.909
 your place at the dish you come to there 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.249
 apply paint weights to 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.819
 the oil at your locations 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:52.439
 your turret you take your brush 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:55.170
 dish that is slightly wet but very 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.409
 light and you come to shoot at your 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.340
 tank pull you to the maximum 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.709
 and there you start having 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.090
 drips at the level of your paintings 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.719
 see we start to have in mind 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.579
 washed out so we start to see a 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:14.489
 result of tanks that begins to have 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:16.340
 we know well fought see 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.109
 you have an effect that is still 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.240
 other than what you find there next 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.430
 as an example then you want to level 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.770
 of all your weld to appear 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.479
 so you pick up your brush 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.310
 and the natural term tempers you and 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.400
 to the maximum and you will sink 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.280
 so we call it cool and that's it 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.259
 is that cool that's it you run a 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.630
 exactly there are several terms one 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.630
 made running ran down 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:00.880
 and you where does it at each level of 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:04.360
 hollow where you want to pop up and 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.139
 then we take full jump when 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.780
 you see you are not enough 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.370
 satisfied and well here you go again 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.699
 and / or shot of course in the sense 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.699
 opposite 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.120
 here is a juice effect that gives a 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.530
 little aging 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.100
 ok ok well listen and we will make a video 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:01.780
 soon with the work of thinning at 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.780
 armored level see you soon
