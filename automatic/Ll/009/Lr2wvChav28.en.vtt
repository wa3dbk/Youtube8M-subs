00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.139
 Hello everyone, I want to tell you about 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.080
 alternatives after the screen lock yes 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.019
 specifically for smart phones but it is with 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.439
 using the slide unlock program 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.569
 and how can we no longer use this 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.820
 foreign blocking rate 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.410
 some fear that he may 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 get loose with time and even sort of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.989
 who has such a family 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.969
 yes, let me show you what 

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.259
 program by the way the lever I also can 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.730
 cause and so here 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.140
 100 g we unlocked 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.460
 sprat screen we will see the interface 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.020
 programs here everything that he quickly and bookmarks 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.700
 browser kurkul ator 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.800
 Sabonis for example and moves the slider 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 we can condemn these actions for example here 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.470
 unlock as you can see at work 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.700
 a button appears on the table 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.100
 clicking who we lived there cause 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.470
 program here from setting in 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.760
 MB settings can be changed for example 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.500
 interfaces to make a style interface 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 iphone 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.640
 as you can see en in mu picture too 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 change them to unlock with 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.100
 dynia slider 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 barely eating fashionable 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080
 change interfaces score 1 there 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 as happy as christmas 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.100
 here we have to and move 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.370
 star on the herringbone pc to unlock 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.020
 of programs 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 but the firecrackers I said it was impossible not 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 use her lever 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.659
 new locks for example i will show how 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.719
 get off for example pressing the white buttons 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.150
 double 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.180
 we blocked the tracks 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.760
 single clicked interface is invoked 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.120
 programs 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 also has it in the program yet 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.660
 alarms which by the way does not work 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.750
 is always 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.060
 but it works on the principle 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 accelerometer and basically turns off 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 like but running the program and therefore 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 it is like an alarm but does not fit a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.360
 just find out 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.390
 took such that according to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.110
 but I think on this from the program we 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.259
 sorted out 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.669
 also it is possible for example 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 disconnect phone 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.619
 and turn on with the camera key here 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.079
 see pressing the camera key is the same 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.959
 launch 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.309
 eg 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 red greens do not include well in general 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.989
 In principle, this is a good replacement for levers. 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.209
 as there are quick bookmarks and there are 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.689
 multiple interfaces can 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.319
 change picture 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.359
 On this I think everything is all bye.
