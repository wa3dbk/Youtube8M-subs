00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 so we now i look at the screen like this 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:13.250
 here are the viewing angles of course yes night is 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.320
 clearly visible but much better than 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.650
 most 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.900
 tablets I tried here 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 bright splash 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:29.279
 so beautiful yes let's also I check on 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.630
 sun as it will be directly on 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.420
 the sun is worse here but I don't know how 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.670
 you on camera but I'm not even bad 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.390
 seen especially due to the fact that bright 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 screen saver 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 very nice everything looks and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.840
 so hello everyone today is already full 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 first day of using nexus 7 second 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 generations and I will lay out last night 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.699
 Unpacking the tablet and now I wanted 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 would share a little bit of emotion and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.439
 impressions of the nexus 7 second 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 generations and well how could it be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.000
 some pros and cons that i 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.740
 I will definitely do it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 directly review this tablet 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.330
 to have more voluminous information in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.689
 this tablet but the first is me 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 really pleased you can 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.060
 say that he became thinner that is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.229
 really thinner and i'm holding it in my hand 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.240
 and the feeling that he was well, such as on 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 order has become thinner I still do 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.290
 nexus 7 comparison first generation and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.700
 second generation 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.520
 This is the first and second that I noticed except 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.590
 the fact that very much the screen 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.680
 although in fact it's probably in all 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 tablets so 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.470
 well yes to this all tablet so okay i 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.050
 I know that it is in all tablets so well 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.890
 the rear cap is also tied though 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.320
 it is plastic and by the way very pleasant 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 and the second chip I noticed is 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.950
 camera that's 5 megapixels here 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.550
 something she seemed to me quite horror 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.840
 some 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.790
 Of course I will take another asus memo pad hd 7 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 which I did a review 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 Well, I will probably also do it on purpose 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.160
 comparison is like nexus 7 is also 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.430
 Asusov tablet there is also a camera and I 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.239
 I think that it would be possible to compare the camera 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.810
 on the nexus 7 second generation and us him 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.660
 that is because there is no first generation 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.230
 Camera's well that it seemed to me that she 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.540
 it's not very much that a little bit of me 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.180
 he was alert nexus 7 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.190
 this is this nexus 7 although i'm not yet 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.160
 I tried it I think that tomorrow today 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.190
 I will try and release the video tomorrow 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.459
 specifically as if with a test I heard about 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.840
 such a rumor that there is any 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.660
 The problem with the gps sensor is not always 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.310
 gps works or more precisely through 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.560
 for a while he is cut down and not 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.670
 cut in 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.209
 that it seems to me that someone started a rumor 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.630
 specifically to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.670
 to discredit nexus itself but if that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.180
 really so because I did not find 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.629
 on the internet anywhere 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.719
 no explanation, that is just one 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.069
 one place in one site was such a rumor 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:44.819
 and I do nâ€™t know everything 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:51.489
 impression cool display me 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:53.680
 like that is bright so here 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.079
 I will not show him very much 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.079
 show that's the truth just so bright 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.389
 splash 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.299
 cool shorter than the first day like 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.439
 interesting and by the way the sound from the speakers 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.870
 what two speakers 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:12.519
 although funny it was probably to sing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:17.019
 and the speakers were like htc in principle so 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.750
 ok too I need to say ok 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:24.000
 it was such a first impression 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.990
 first day of using nexus 7 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.930
 let's see what happens next but now 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:37.070
 here you can see how the screen looks 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:43.820
 in the sun yes you see the time here 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:48.020
 screen than the rest of the asus 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.490
 and why are you walking on the big screen not 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.979
 yes yes better than asus 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:05:00.789
 Well, other needs and fasteners 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.789
 looked at screen 2
