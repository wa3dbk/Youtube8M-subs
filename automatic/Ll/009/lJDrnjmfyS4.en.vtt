night eight pm-10 p.m. the reason why

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.400 
night eight pm-10 p.m. the reason why
for<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.850> change<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> lot<00:02:25.380> of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
for this change is because a lot of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.960 
for this change is because a lot of
times<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.770> did<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> once<00:02:26.220> at<00:02:26.459> night<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.819> did

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
times I did it once at night and I did

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.350 
times I did it once at night and I did
once<00:02:27.180> during<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> morning<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.360> both

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
once during the in the morning and both

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.880 
once during the in the morning and both
times<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.840> felt<00:02:30.959> like<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.200> people<00:02:31.680> are<00:02:31.770> upset

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
times I felt like I people are upset

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
times I felt like I people are upset
because<00:02:32.130> they<00:02:32.280> didn't<00:02:32.489> get<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:32.940> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
because they didn't get it and this is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.120 
because they didn't get it and this is
like<00:02:33.270> two<00:02:33.510> chances<00:02:34.020> whichever<00:02:34.410> ones<00:02:34.650> closest

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
