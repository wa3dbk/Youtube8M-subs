the back here we can take a look this
mechanism<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.330> cool<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.900> pull<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
mechanism it's really cool you pull this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
mechanism it's really cool you pull this
down<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> locks<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.480> can

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
down all the way to locks out I can

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.389 
down all the way to locks out I can
actually<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.320> slide<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.679> phone<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
actually just slide that phone out of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
actually just slide that phone out of
there<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.270> know<00:00:33.360> play<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> little

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
there you know play a little

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
there you know play a little
notification<00:00:34.290> tone<00:00:34.829> usually<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> phone<00:00:36.510> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
notification tone usually the phone is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.420 
notification tone usually the phone is
actually<00:00:36.719> set<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> silent<00:00:37.320> right<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:37.770> but

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
actually set to silent right now but

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
actually set to silent right now but
then<00:00:39.059> we'll<00:00:39.450> continue<00:00:39.690> playing<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.530> video

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
then we'll continue playing the video

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.299 
then we'll continue playing the video
from<00:00:41.160> where<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:41.960> right<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.309> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
from where we left off right there and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.910 
from where we left off right there and
continues<00:00:44.700> playing<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.649> it's<00:00:46.649> pretty

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
continues playing like it's it's pretty

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
continues playing like it's it's pretty
seamless<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.550> maybe<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> two

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
seamless there's maybe a one to two

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180 
seamless there's maybe a one to two
second<00:00:48.989> lag<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.590> switching<00:00:49.770> modes

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
second lag when you're switching modes

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
second lag when you're switching modes
but<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.090> android<00:00:51.480> 4.0<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.110> designed<00:00:52.379> for

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
but because android 4.0 is designed for

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.920 
but because android 4.0 is designed for
both<00:00:52.739> phones<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.579> tablets<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
both phones and tablets it's going to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
both phones and tablets it's going to
correctly<00:00:55.260> optimize<00:00:55.710> itself<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.160> whichever

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
correctly optimize itself or whichever

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
correctly optimize itself or whichever
form<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.879> you're<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.930> whatever

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
form back you're using and whatever

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319

times<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
times as you can see here we have the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
times as you can see here we have the
phone<00:01:00.719> interface<00:01:01.199> before<00:01:01.559> point<00:01:01.829> oh<00:01:01.920> you've

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
phone interface before point oh you've

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
phone interface before point oh you've
got<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> lot<00:01:03.840> cleaner<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.379> more

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
got it's a lot cleaner a lot more

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
got it's a lot cleaner a lot more
user-friendly<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.729> similar<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> what

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
user-friendly is very similar to what

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
user-friendly is very similar to what
you'll<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.229> transformer<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you'll see on the transformer and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.200 
you'll see on the transformer and
transformer<00:01:08.400> prime<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.060> near

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
transformer prime in the very near

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.109 
transformer prime in the very near
future<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.140> 4.2<00:01:10.619> update<00:01:10.939> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.030> actually

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
future the 4.2 update you can actually

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.929 
future the 4.2 update you can actually
go<00:01:12.330> ahead<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> dock<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
go ahead and dock this back in and this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.600 
go ahead and dock this back in and this
is<00:01:15.119> still<00:01:15.330> prototype<00:01:15.780> hardware<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.860> little

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is still prototype hardware so a little

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
is still prototype hardware so a little
bit<00:01:17.790> tough<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.240> plus<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> haven't<00:01:18.990> used<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bit tough and plus I haven't used this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
bit tough and plus I haven't used this
too<00:01:19.350> much<00:01:19.470> before<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.970> slide<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> in

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
too much before but you just slide it in

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
too much before but you just slide it in
there<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:24.110> just<00:01:25.110> take<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> second<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
there I just take me a second not so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
there I just take me a second not so
used<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
used to this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
used to this
I<00:01:29.539> think<00:01:30.539> I<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.289> go<00:01:31.759> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I think I had it there there we go and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
I think I had it there there we go and
close<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:32.969> in<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:34.289> as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.649> see<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
close it in and as you can see it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.779 
close it in and as you can see it
transforms<00:01:35.700> very<00:01:36.689> much<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> transformer

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
transforms very much like a transformer

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.940 
transforms very much like a transformer
to<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.090> tablet<00:01:39.659> interface<00:01:39.899> for<00:01:40.259> android<00:01:40.530> 4.0

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to the tablet interface for android 4.0

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
to the tablet interface for android 4.0
so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.610> you've<00:01:41.729> used<00:01:41.909> any<00:01:42.210> Android<00:01:42.720> tablets

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so if you've used any Android tablets

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.330 
so if you've used any Android tablets
you'll<00:01:43.289> recognize<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.829> interface<00:01:44.189> you've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you'll recognize this interface you've

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
you'll recognize this interface you've
got<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.579> notifications<00:01:45.179> up<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.720> instead

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
got your notifications up here instead
