00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.720
 she can speak today I'm doing a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 match so know he's wasting my time 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.970
 I did not do video match I had a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.550
 comment not long ago on a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 old Janzean video and I had been told 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.370
 it was a good idea 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 so I said no yes no crazy and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.050
 besides that I have the ideal thing is to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 say of products in the end almost 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.529
 identical 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 and since I see you flip through 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.199
 so we have the camp they call it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.740
 an eye liner flow fluids line not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.950
 fluid fluid line diagram that 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 against the makeup cream from home so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.290
 especially big price difference I 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 thought 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 that one it seemed to me in the 18 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 euros and this one is at 5 and some I 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 believe if I will put this on the link 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.750
 in the article of my blog movement 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 info bar 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 in short I thought also with a map 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.500
 gift because I was lodged I was 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.300
 in my plum period where I wanted to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.989
 queens at all costs it's called macro 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.799
 purple this is actually I already 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.650
 this one called burgundy shake 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.000
 to be and so here they are one next to 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.040
 the other 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.150
 so yes when we talk about the make up on 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 is a bit short is what you buy 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 twice the same thing pretty much 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 good they are not quite the same 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 anyway then he 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.930
 how can I start the match 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 is a lot more creamy the medic is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 much drier much faster 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.730
 it is a little more texture 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.370
 with aqua cream from make up for ever 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.479
 the mac is supposed to be an eyeliner then 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.920
 I can not find enough 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.270
 pigmented for is an eyeliner 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.650
 every time i am super disappointed i 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.800
 tried in the lining I tried in 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.080
 misses he sees there every time I finish 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.280
 to go through with black we talk about 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.050
 blur it to make it all 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 eyelid but I find it not at all 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.670
 I find a little disappointing the 13th rank I 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 was expecting something crazy and I was 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.790
 a little bit disappointed so now I 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.350
 I use it as a friend 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.600
 take with my finger and I slice it 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 all there the eyelid for 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.030
 use it as a base in fact like 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.600
 it's pretty creamy it's pretty 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.280
 nice and the medic and well I you 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.930
 say how dry they are, we can 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.910
 put in base but that's because it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.080
 will bring out the most it's because he 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 will snag the most actually the powder 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 they are because they 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.870
 hang the most powder so so 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.090
 this is it depends a little on usaj 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.230
 that actually wanted to his at the swatch so 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 I put my glasses back really 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.260
 disgusting and so I wish I'll 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.239
 just do with my finger for each 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:51.890
 So that's the doctor here is my 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.890
 passage and then I'm going to mac 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.580
 but suddenly you see that this one 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.380
 still shines a lot more and who 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.690
 does more plum while the Swiss 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.630
 this one goes in a little bit more 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.920
 rape then no I do not see at all 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.000
 in the pot but that one is not been 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 there almost 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.930
 and you see the mcl yet i'm 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.880
 to go back several times 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.530
 contours are finally it's not very very 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.210
 opaque actually that's why I had 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.200
 found that a little disappointing because 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.960
 that even putting a lot does not make it 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.310
 a rendering of crazy so here they are 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.690
 still a little different so 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.060
 I told myself I'm not completely 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.790
 fooled and that I can use both 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.430
 no problem but good if you have to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.900
 to buy one you can very well 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.110
 they are not necessary both 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.690
 collectible as cream blush or as 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.050
 of aspirin if I did not have to choose 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.610
 that a beat events like I have 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.610
 trend is rather mowed right now 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.990
 I could beat the doctor and he Paschal 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.030
 does he do his job well and he can 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.239
 very well serve as eyeliner also it is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.680
 brighter and that's it duel price of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.720
 this one and since I was a little disappointed 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.900
 beat ga rather towards this one there is the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.240
 color armadillo that exist in plum that I 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.830
 have unfortunately not here I think 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.600
 that he's close enough too must be 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.130
 a little bit between the two actually it's a 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.169
 little like that but a little more prudish a 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.490
 little less violated maybe that's who 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.320
 give a name to miguel who told me 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.090
 that he was a little disappointing and 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.660
 so here and to show you then I 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.290
 I covered the infamous May 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.900
 it's I'm wearing the medic in base of a 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.700
 lighthouse plum right there and if you want 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.250
 see jelly used in the video 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.160
 well I'm talking about those born cup so I 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.480

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.650
 if you're interested and last thing 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.690
 I have a hairstyle attention where I did 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.680
 an essay I do not know if I do not like it 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.670
 it's successful I do not know if I tell them 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.130
 will do once in my life but I 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.960

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.530
 little videos match I have planned one 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.530
 second with the aqua cream 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.190

 colorado to the bronze standards that 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.630
