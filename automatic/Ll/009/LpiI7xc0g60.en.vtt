complete disbelief right now but wait
till<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.010> hear<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.340> last<00:03:15.640> ingredient<00:03:15.940> used

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
till you hear the last ingredient used

till you hear the last ingredient used
to<00:03:16.630> make<00:03:16.750> sucralose<00:03:17.459> formaldehyde<00:03:18.459> which<00:03:18.880> is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
to make sucralose formaldehyde which is

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.020 
to make sucralose formaldehyde which is
used<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:20.080> preserve<00:03:20.260> dead<00:03:20.830> body<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.550> preserve

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.360 
used to preserve dead body to preserve
dead<00:03:22.510> bodies<00:03:23.140> now<00:03:23.410> my<00:03:23.709> thinking<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:24.220> this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
dead bodies now my thinking is this

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.520 
dead bodies now my thinking is this
maybe<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.700> could<00:03:24.880> be<00:03:25.000> wrong<00:03:25.230> formaldehyde<00:03:26.230> is

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
maybe I could be wrong formaldehyde is

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.979 
maybe I could be wrong formaldehyde is
four<00:03:26.800> dead<00:03:26.980> bodies<00:03:27.010> not<00:03:27.850> for<00:03:28.150> live<00:03:28.360> bodies<00:03:28.840> we

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
four dead bodies not for live bodies we

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.590 
four dead bodies not for live bodies we
