a<00:02:07.490> little<00:02:08.030> difficult<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.599> acoustic<00:02:09.140> but

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
a little difficult to do on acoustic but

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.800

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
bend it up from the fifth fret and then

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.340 
bend it up from the fifth fret and then
we're<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> take<00:02:14.269> our<00:02:14.450> pinky<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> we're

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.360 

like<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.560> we're<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.860> play<00:02:26.129> those

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
two strings together the G and the B so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.619 
two strings together the G and the B so
I'm<00:02:29.129> going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.280> try<00:02:29.519> one<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:29.790> time<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
I'm going to try one more time see if I

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.840 
I'm going to try one more time see if I

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.520 

and<00:02:35.850> then<00:02:36.840> we're<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> bend<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> back

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and then we're going to bend it back

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.550 
and then we're going to bend it back
down<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.850> land<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> second<00:02:39.990> fret<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
down and land on the second fret of the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.330 
down and land on the second fret of the
g-string<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.780> second<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.220> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
g-string so that second part is going to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:55.170 
g-string so that second part is going to
be<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.890> then<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.760> then

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.700 

so<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.420> together<00:02:56.660> I'll<00:02:57.080> play<00:02:57.350> through<00:02:57.590> it
