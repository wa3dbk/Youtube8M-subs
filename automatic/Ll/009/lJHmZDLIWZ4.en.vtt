it um almost everything on this thing is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.720 
it um almost everything on this thing is
identical<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.920> Soundlink<00:00:26.430> one

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
identical to the Soundlink one

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.200 
identical to the Soundlink one
everything<00:00:27.510> from<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> battery<00:00:28.560> size<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
everything from the battery size to the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.700 
everything from the battery size to the
back<00:00:30.570> even<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.619> model<00:00:32.040> numbers<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.420> same

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
back even the model numbers are the same

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.319 
back even the model numbers are the same
but<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.010> only<00:00:35.190> thing<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.120> tell

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
but the only thing that you can tell

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
but the only thing that you can tell
that<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> Soundlink<00:00:37.230> too<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.489> now

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that is the Soundlink too is that now

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
that is the Soundlink too is that now
instead<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.079> their<00:00:40.559> hat<00:00:40.710> used<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> be

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
instead of like their hat used to be

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
instead of like their hat used to be
like<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:42.030> tag<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.200> now

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like the little tag right here it's now

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.950 
like the little tag right here it's now
in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> middle<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.480> folds<00:00:45.809> down

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in the middle so that just folds down

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.369 
in the middle so that just folds down
like<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> flips<00:00:47.940> over<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
like that and then it flips over as it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.220 
like that and then it flips over as it
would<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.329> used<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
would or as it as it used to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
would or as it as it used to
now<00:00:52.440> since<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> flap<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> little

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
now since that flap is a little

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930 
now since that flap is a little
different<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.559> folds<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
different it actually folds in like that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
different it actually folds in like that
and<00:00:57.270> lets<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.170> set<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> bows<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.850> can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and lets you set the bows down you can

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
and lets you set the bows down you can
see<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.590> rather<00:01:01.590> thinner<00:01:02.100> than<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> big

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
see it's rather thinner than the big

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.680 
see it's rather thinner than the big
jambox

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
jambox

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.050 
jambox
but<00:01:04.650> also<00:01:05.119> it's<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:07.040> secure<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.820> means

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
but also it's not as secure that means

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.480 
but also it's not as secure that means
if<00:01:09.270> you're<00:01:09.420> driving<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:10.020> its<00:01:10.770> you've<00:01:11.340> got

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you're driving around its you've got

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
if you're driving around its you've got
to<00:01:11.640> set<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.420> mean<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:12.960> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to set this thing down I mean it's it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.469 
to set this thing down I mean it's it's
a<00:01:13.290> very<00:01:13.320> nice<00:01:13.710> speaker<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.729> sound<00:01:14.970> quality<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a very nice speaker the sound quality is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.010 
a very nice speaker the sound quality is
very<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.119> you

both are Bluetooth speakers however I'm

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.660 
both are Bluetooth speakers however I'm
actually<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> only<00:01:49.490> connect<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.640> via

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
actually going to only connect it via

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.179 
actually going to only connect it via
this<00:01:51.540> cord<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.979> switch

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this cord so that way I can just switch

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
this cord so that way I can just switch
between<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:54.049> quickly<00:01:56.420> go<00:01:57.420> ahead<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> plug

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
between them quickly go ahead and plug

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
between them quickly go ahead and plug
this<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:59.060> turn<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> big<00:02:00.570> Jambox<00:02:01.490> go<00:02:02.490> ahead

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
this in turn on the big Jambox go ahead

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
this in turn on the big Jambox go ahead
and<00:02:02.969> place<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.780> music<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.740> give<00:02:05.040> me<00:02:05.100> one

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and place some music now give me one

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.910 
and place some music now give me one
second<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.240> actually<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.530> decimal

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
second I actually do have a decimal

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.029 
second I actually do have a decimal
reader<00:02:08.399> right<00:02:08.610> here

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
reader right here

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:40.360 
reader right here
so<00:02:10.729> crank<00:02:11.629> this<00:02:11.810> up

have to say the big Jambox is still my

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.920 
have to say the big Jambox is still my
favorite<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:30.860> because<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.700> its<00:04:31.910> design<00:04:32.180> and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
favorite just because of its design and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.010 
favorite just because of its design and
how<00:04:33.200> much<00:04:33.560> easier<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.430> set<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.120> just

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
how much easier it is to set it on just

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.840 
how much easier it is to set it on just
about<00:04:36.140> anything<00:04:36.560> compared<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.550> slimmer

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
about anything compared to the slimmer

about anything compared to the slimmer
design<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:39.200> Soundlink<00:04:39.800> where<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.610> tip

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
design of the Soundlink where it can tip

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.770 
design of the Soundlink where it can tip
over<00:04:41.210> or<00:04:41.780> tip<00:04:42.080> front<00:04:42.590> words<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.910> that's<00:04:44.510> the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
over or tip front words so that's the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.980 
over or tip front words so that's the
comparison<00:04:45.520> both<00:04:46.520> great<00:04:46.940> speakers<00:04:47.540> just
