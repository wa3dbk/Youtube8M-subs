00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.539
 this legend begins in a city of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.720
 USA where a child 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.199
 and his friend spent playing pokemon 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.199
 stadium 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.500
 and then it was done some time and the friend 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.590
 the child had to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630
 the next morning the boy called his 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.739
 friend to see if he wanted to play because no 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.370
 it's warm and he said not that he wanted 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.070
 play something else 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.770
 then the boy's friend took the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.190
 nintendo game boy game adapter 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 64 and the yellow pokemon cartridge to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 the house of the child and the child 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 they are a challenge for me to get 6 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.649
 peaks that will end the game with 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 they the friend later accepted later on 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.720
 child watched stunned with his friend and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.210
 stuck to the 6 pikes all over the world 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 he knows that there is only the picacho that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 give at the beginning of the game 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.440
 and then it became true now again 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.470
 and the boy's friend said there was no 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.570
 problem that if I wanted to stay 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 playing and then basic 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.300
 the boy kept playing with the cartridge 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.770
 of his friend then saw as the peaks 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.770
 they evolved to kings 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.020
 the 6 peaks left the television and 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.240
 they took the most horrible form that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.810
 could 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.659
 the boy tried to flee but the peaks 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.180
 they cornered him and proceeded to take him 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.080
 all the parts of his body leaving 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.310
 just the cd 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.380
 the next morning 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.890
 the child's parents watched as their 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.789
 son was no longer the nintendo 64 was 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 turned on and the TV worked badly 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.530
 the parents screamed when 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.649
 they saw blood dripping from the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.710
 TV forming on the floor 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.070
 the word bad 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.430
 the parents called the boy's friend and 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.489
 then proceeded to sue in attempt 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.219
 Nintendo said no child could 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.870
 disappear in that way and then when 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.569
 the boy's friend said he had 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.140
 trapped 6 peaks all stayed 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.829
 with his mouth open nintendo made him a 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.530
 homage to the child in the pokemon by creating 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.329
 a character called little fan for his 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.329
 fanaticism to the pickets
