going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.700> go<00:00:02.820> over<00:00:02.850> my<00:00:03.629> 35<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.589> guide<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.250> I

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
going to go over my 35 to guide what I

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.690 
going to go over my 35 to guide what I
think<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.930> best<00:00:07.140> setup<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.799> 352<00:00:08.220> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
think is the best setup for the 352 the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.419 
think is the best setup for the 352 the
best<00:00:08.880> like<00:00:09.120> instructions<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.290> perhaps<00:00:10.980> like

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
best like instructions and perhaps like

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.860 
best like instructions and perhaps like
some<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.300> are<00:00:12.480> like<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
some of what I would think are like the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.410 
some of what I would think are like the
best<00:00:13.019> players<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.679> use<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.099> 352<00:00:14.639> now<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.269> is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
high defensive work grades for example

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.529

Mel DD is medium high the same with
block<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> course<00:01:01.530> des<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.160> low<00:01:02.730> high

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
block and then of course des is low high

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
block and then of course des is low high
I<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> high<00:01:04.650> defense<00:01:04.979> workers

while payload be considered the fast guy
way<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> would<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.440> considered<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.890> strong

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
way it would be considered the strong

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
and strength is the best of both worlds

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.420 
and strength is the best of both worlds
but<00:03:48.960> this<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.320> kind<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> set<00:03:50.070> up<00:03:50.190> some

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
but this is kind of like the set up some

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.110 
but this is kind of like the set up some
tips<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.850> some<00:03:51.590> instructions<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:53.120> typically

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
tips on some instructions I typically

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.720 
tips on some instructions I typically
would<00:03:54.450> put<00:03:54.840> on<00:03:55.020> mice<00:03:55.320> mice<00:03:55.680> strikers<00:03:56.550> that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730

to stay forward and they'll give him
that<00:04:32.320> free<00:04:32.680> roam<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.910> can<00:04:34.060> kind<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.330> just

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
that free roam so you can kind of just

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.360 
that free roam so you can kind of just
go<00:04:34.660> over<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.050> balls<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.590> really<00:04:35.830> creates

go over the balls and really creates
them<00:04:36.490> over<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:37.990> know<00:04:38.110> some<00:04:38.260> overlapping

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
them over so you know some overlapping

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.440 
them over so you know some overlapping
stuff<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.490> custom<00:04:39.970> good<00:04:40.210> good

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
stuff like that really custom good good

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.430 
stuff like that really custom good good
play<00:04:40.660> there<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.440> then<00:04:42.160> for<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.610> CDMS<00:04:43.420> i<00:04:44.020> would

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
play there and then for my CDMS i would

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.960 
play there and then for my CDMS i would
say<00:04:44.740> i<00:04:44.950> would<00:04:44.980> tell<00:04:45.250> one<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.580> them<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:45.790> stay

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
say i would tell one of them to stay

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.540 
say i would tell one of them to stay
back<00:04:46.210> ivr<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.170> case<00:04:47.380> his<00:04:47.950> instructions

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
back ivr in this case his instructions

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.000 
back ivr in this case his instructions
would<00:04:48.670> be<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:49.060> him<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.270> stay<00:04:49.450> back<00:04:50.010> while

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.640 
would be to for him to stay back while
attacking<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.790> then<00:04:52.450> for<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.230> other<00:04:53.350> one<00:04:53.620> i

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
attacking and then for the other one i

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.590 
attacking and then for the other one i
leave<00:04:54.220> him<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.490> balance<00:04:54.880> because<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.510> know

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
leave him on balance because you know

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.390 
leave him on balance because you know
with<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:55.930> high<00:04:56.170> work<00:04:56.470> rate<00:04:56.500> summit<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.100> us<00:04:57.220> and

with the high work rate summit I us and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.640 
with the high work rate summit I us and
go<00:04:57.460> up<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.640> down<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:58.030> pitch<00:04:58.380> those<00:04:59.380> are<00:04:59.500> some

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
go up and down the pitch those are some

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.550 
go up and down the pitch those are some
tips<00:04:59.830> on<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.070> 352<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.880> really<00:05:01.240> think<00:05:01.420> that<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
key is to have got the center defensive

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.930 
key is to have got the center defensive
backs<00:05:05.080> with<00:05:05.290> high<00:05:05.440> defensive<00:05:05.890> work<00:05:06.070> rates<00:05:06.310> you
