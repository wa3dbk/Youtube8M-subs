00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.370
 here I have my loin steaks 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.779
 you do not die and now what I'm going to do 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:18.160
 before taking it to a sealed is 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.690
 seasoning 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.690
 I'm going to put pepper 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.710
 this is to taste already having the tenderloin 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.290
 What I'm going to do is go to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.370
 the pan that should already be at a 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:39.230
 hot high temperature to seal 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.710
 these two pieces of tenderloin I'll put my 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.710
 First 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:57.190
 I'll let them seal on each side 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 45 minutes have passed the first 5 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.850
 minutes and now back 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.850
 look how it is below 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.160
 in another pan I will put 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.160
 and a little oil 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530
 onion 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.119
 softening without taking coloring so 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.159
 I must be aware of moving them 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.280
 frequently so that 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.109
 do not go to burn and the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.619
 second part of the other five minutes 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:42.079
 at high heat now I'm going to take out the tenderloin 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.469
 from behind and I'm going to pass the onion to this 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.469
 part 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 the coloring that you just gave me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.299
 give a wine bath but nothing more about 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.829
 the colander is not something different from me 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.289
 I always like a little wine before 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:11.200
 but basically I only received no 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:15.150
 about the on the action 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 I'm going to put the thyme 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.640
 is my favorite if you want you can use 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.640
 something here or rosemary 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.480
 I'm going to wear stockings has come I paint 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.940
 I have 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.720
 there is no certain reserved 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.720
 academic 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.590
 what I'm going to do is let this 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.450
 cut in half this wine has to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.910
 elaborate free all the alcohol that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.690
 bring 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.850
 impregnate the onion and should reduce 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.810
 that something is going to form a bit more 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:04.810
 thick as a sauce type or something like that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 is what I 'm going to bathe the steak 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 Loin after 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.390
 here you can see that it starts to boil 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.420
 and you realize that already 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.020
 He evaporated its alcohol because no longer smells 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.020
 alcohol 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.170
 at the moment you want 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.170
 can remove thyme or grass 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.189
 aromatic they have put with leave 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.530
 23 minutes and already does its work already 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.970
 reduced pretty I'm going to add a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.970
 spoonful of wheat flour 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.459
 to help thicken a little thick 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.560
 quite pretty is starting to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.310
 dry what I'm going to do is lower the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.170
 fire and put it on bass I had it up high 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.709
 and bring the tenderloin steaks back to 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.709
 the pan 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.510
 the bathrooms with the little sauce that we 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.400
 remains 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.400
 so that it impregnates a little 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.340
 of the salsita 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.590
 I'll leave it here for 5 minutes on fire 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.010
 medium or medium-low any of the 25 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.800
 minutes and I would be completely ready 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.720
 to serve 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.270
 You can accompany it with baked potatoes or 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.690
 french fries some salad all 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:51.270
 It depends on what you like to eat 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:54.240
 of the diet you take 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.480
 with what you better take with that what 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 You can follow some asparagus 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:05.460
 soon steamed a delight 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.669

 of the finest slices in the network and so 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.419
 as it is super thin it is super expensive it is 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.249
 a bit expensive but it's worth it 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.359
