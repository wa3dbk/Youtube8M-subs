00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
along the rail also gives you a great
place<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.040> thumbs<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.970> duck

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
place to put your thumbs when your duck

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.460 
place to put your thumbs when your duck
diving<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> look<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.259> thumbs

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
diving if you look like your thumbs

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.350 
diving if you look like your thumbs
gonna<00:01:49.710> fit<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.700> when<00:01:51.210> you're

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
gonna fit right in there when you're

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.670 
gonna fit right in there when you're
pushing<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> board<00:01:51.930> underneath<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> water

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
pushing the board underneath the water

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.080 
pushing the board underneath the water
and<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:52.920> could<00:01:53.070> prevent<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.579> thumb<00:01:53.880> from

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and it's could prevent your thumb from

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
and it's could prevent your thumb from
getting<00:01:54.299> blown<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> side<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.950> the

underneath where if you didn't have this

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
underneath where if you didn't have this
your<00:01:59.820> finger<00:02:00.090> would<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
your finger would just go right out and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.260 
your finger would just go right out and
you<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.049> lose<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> board<00:02:01.619> duck<00:02:01.890> diving

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you would lose the board duck diving

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.139 
you would lose the board duck diving
this<00:02:03.270> board<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:04.070> paddle<00:02:05.070> length<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.850> really

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this board on paddle length it's really

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.270 
this board on paddle length it's really
important<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.409> width<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> board<00:02:08.069> it's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
important the width of the board it's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.619 
important the width of the board it's
got<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> good<00:02:08.640> width<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.450> bit

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
got a good width on it it's a little bit

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.650 
got a good width on it it's a little bit
over<00:02:09.869> 22<00:02:10.319> inches<00:02:10.619> wide<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.390> too

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
over 22 inches wide so it's not too

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.790 
over 22 inches wide so it's not too
gunny<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
gunny from the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
gunny from the
so<00:02:14.100> it's<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.310> gonna<00:02:14.460> feel<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so it's not gonna feel like a like a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.020 
so it's not gonna feel like a like a
needle<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.050> speed<00:02:16.380> needle<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.160> another

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
needle like a speed needle and another

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.250 
needle like a speed needle and another
thing<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:18.510> important<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:18.960> bigger

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
thing that's important for bigger

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.440 
thing that's important for bigger
surfers<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> nice<00:02:20.370> big<00:02:20.610> tail<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
surfers is to have a nice big tail so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.100 
surfers is to have a nice big tail so
you<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.110> got<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> Halfmoon<00:02:22.560> tail<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you see it's got a Halfmoon tail on it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.920 
you see it's got a Halfmoon tail on it
and<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> board<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.740> then<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.860> five<00:02:26.160> fin<00:02:26.430> set<00:02:26.760> up

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and the board and then a five fin set up

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.060 
and the board and then a five fin set up
out<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.110> back<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.560> board<00:02:28.830> could<00:02:29.010> be

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
out the back so this board could be

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.060 
out the back so this board could be
written<00:02:29.310> either<00:02:29.430> quad<00:02:29.820> or<00:02:30.150> tri<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.860> should

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
written either quad or tri and it should

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.410 
written either quad or tri and it should
be<00:02:32.190> written<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> bigger<00:02:32.910> set<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> fins

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
be written with a bigger set of fins

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.000 
be written with a bigger set of fins
unless<00:02:33.690> you're<00:02:33.900> lighter<00:02:34.140> surfer<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.710> using

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
unless you're lighter surfer and using

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430 
unless you're lighter surfer and using
this<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.240> first<00:02:36.480> boards<00:02:36.870> if

going to be a great board like we said

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.110 
going to be a great board like we said
to<00:02:57.450> transition<00:02:57.990> off<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.440> longboard<00:02:59.120> not

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to transition off of a longboard not

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.940 
to transition off of a longboard not
necessarily<00:03:00.720> forever<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.650> some<00:03:01.860> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the better wave days still gives you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.390 
the better wave days still gives you
plenty<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.320> length<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.740> paddling<00:03:05.100> powered

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
plenty of length and paddling powered

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.790 
plenty of length and paddling powered
it's<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.760> don't<00:03:06.120> suffer<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.720> wave<00:03:06.900> count<00:03:07.200> but

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
it's you don't suffer in wave count but

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.750 
it's you don't suffer in wave count but
you're<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.160> able<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.340> throw<00:03:08.610> this

you're going to be able to throw this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.820 
you're going to be able to throw this
thing<00:03:08.820> around<00:03:09.120> significantly<00:03:10.080> easier<00:03:10.380> than<00:03:10.800> a
