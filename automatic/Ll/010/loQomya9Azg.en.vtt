to talk about fixing or checking for

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.560 
to talk about fixing or checking for
leaks<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.370> the<00:00:11.370> clarinet<00:00:11.790> without<00:00:12.090> using<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
leaks in the clarinet without using a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.780 
leaks in the clarinet without using a
leak<00:00:12.750> light<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.710> if<00:00:13.980> your<00:00:14.130> clarinet<00:00:14.429> isn't

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
leak light so if your clarinet isn't

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.880 
leak light so if your clarinet isn't
playing<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:16.020> well<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.500> think<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> should

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
playing as well as you think it should

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.240 
playing as well as you think it should
be<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.400> feels<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.910> little<00:00:18.320> out<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.859> sorts

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
be or it feels a little out of sorts

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.480 
be or it feels a little out of sorts
here's<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> technique<00:00:21.779> very<00:00:22.500> quickly<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
here's the technique very quickly to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.740 
here's the technique very quickly to
just<00:00:23.730> check<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.210> leaks<00:00:24.390> you're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
just check for leaks you're going to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.210 
just check for leaks you're going to
take<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:25.019> mouthpiece<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.590> barrel<00:00:26.039> off

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
take your mouthpiece in your barrel off

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.439 
take your mouthpiece in your barrel off
and<00:00:27.050> then<00:00:28.050> you're<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> depress<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.449> D

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and then you're going to depress the D

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.010 
and then you're going to depress the D
key<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.850> you<00:00:32.850> undo<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
key right here as you undo it so you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.459 
key right here as you undo it so you
don't<00:00:34.399> bend<00:00:35.399> any<00:00:35.670> Keys<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:37.350> you're

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
don't bend any Keys and then you're

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
don't bend any Keys and then you're
going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> finger<00:00:37.980> low<00:00:38.250> C<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:38.910> upper

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
going to finger low C on your upper

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.680 
going to finger low C on your upper
joint<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:40.260> such<00:00:41.120> you're<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> put<00:00:42.510> your

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
joint as such you're going to put your

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
joint as such you're going to put your
right<00:00:42.870> hand<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> cover<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.789> hole<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
right hand here to cover this hole and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.200 
right hand here to cover this hole and
you're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.850> see<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> have

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you're going to see if you have

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.279 
you're going to see if you have
compression<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.079> when<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> blow<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:50.100> here

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
compression if when you blow into here

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
compression if when you blow into here
it<00:00:52.289> doesn't<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:53.280> resistance<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.300> hear

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it doesn't have resistance and you hear

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
it doesn't have resistance and you hear
something<00:00:54.899> coming<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> leak<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
something coming out you have a leak in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
something coming out you have a leak in
your<00:00:56.309> upper<00:00:56.730> joint<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.989> take<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
your upper joint and then you can take a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.799 
your upper joint and then you can take a
look<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.879> where<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.149> might<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.390> coming

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
look to see where that might be coming

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
look to see where that might be coming
from<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.440> might<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:01.949> someone<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
from that that might take someone to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
from that that might take someone to
help<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.870> both<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.350> hands<00:01:04.769> are

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
help you because both of your hands are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
help you because both of your hands are
kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> full<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.479> same<00:01:06.750> procedure

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
kind of full they're the same procedure

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.420 
kind of full they're the same procedure
for<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.640> lower<00:01:08.970> joint<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:10.740> order<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
for the lower joint is in order here and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.350 
for the lower joint is in order here and
once<00:01:14.430> again<00:01:14.610> you're<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.240> to

once again you're going to have to
figure<00:01:15.600> finger<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> note<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.950> covers<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
figure finger a note that covers all of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.780 
figure finger a note that covers all of
the<00:01:18.330> holes<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.320> low<00:01:19.590> e<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the holes so it's going to be low e you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.570 
the holes so it's going to be low e you
need<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.509> hand<00:01:21.750> low<00:01:22.049> e<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.950> okay

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
need to use right hand low e here okay

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
need to use right hand low e here okay
once<00:01:24.330> again<00:01:24.570> you'll<00:01:24.689> put<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:24.990> left<00:01:25.200> hand

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
down here and you'll do the same thing

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.999 
down here and you'll do the same thing
okay<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.930> feel<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
okay and if you don't feel it with the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
okay and if you don't feel it with the
compression<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.329> feel<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> air

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
compression in there if you feel the air

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
compression in there if you feel the air
actually<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.439> through<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.579> you've

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
actually going through you know you've

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually going through you know you've
got<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> leak<00:01:36.659> somewhere

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
got a little bit of a leak somewhere

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
got a little bit of a leak somewhere
then<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.439> try<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> find<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
then you can try to find out where that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
then you can try to find out where that
might<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:39.810> will<00:01:40.200> help<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.470> find<00:01:40.680> weak

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
might be it also will help you find weak

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039 
might be it also will help you find weak
Springs<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> blow<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.360> hard<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Springs if you blow really hard one of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
Springs if you blow really hard one of
the<00:01:43.170> keys<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.890> key<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> weakest<00:01:44.670> spring

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the keys the key with the weakest spring

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
the keys the key with the weakest spring
will<00:01:45.509> pop<00:01:45.750> open<00:01:45.990> first<00:01:48.530> okay<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.130> would

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
will pop open first okay and that would

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.999 
will pop open first okay and that would
be<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.240> clarinet<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
be this one on my clarinet and that is
