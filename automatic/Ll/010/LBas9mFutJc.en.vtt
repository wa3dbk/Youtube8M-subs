00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.309
 hey people here are again sam of must 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.790
 I want you here now my 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.730
 second unboxing video show and that 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.350
 it's about a bluetooth headset that 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.960
 I wished my little brother 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:32.400
 And that's what the whole thing looks like for ps3 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 it is a headset of 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.290
 biotech the model tx 0 1 yes it is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 arrived today I have not got it yet 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.450
 unpacked look what's in it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.410
 I assume that it is not very 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:55.300
 much is separated here are indeed the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.770
 features of this headset also listed 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.680
 in different languages ​​so on 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.570
 English Italian German Spanish 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.369
 french and portuguese and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.420
 course, the highlights under 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.060
 other ergonomic control flexible 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.940
 judgment external speakers led 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.880
 feedback mute or and 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.590
 rechargeable battery I would have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.290
 whole now just a little and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.070
 unpack painlessly and look what 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.050
 in it is 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:38.950
 Tadaa looks like the packaging and it is 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:41.890
 as suspected with a lot in it once 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.550
 the user manual 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.900
 a usb cable and that would have of course 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:56.680
 so at first glance it is not 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:59.410
 especially hard here is another 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.670
 speakers called for with than never 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.479
 itself the flauschige Bauschutts dingsbums 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 tuned 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:15.160
 it is the same way the whole looks from 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 I'll see if you could do that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 but now has to open like that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.510
 whole actually expires and defends you 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:28.709
 then in retrospect show how to do that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:32.739
 whole at the ps3 installed until the same 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.860
 so people, I'll show you how 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.420
 one headset said one of the best 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.730
 So you judge yourself completely 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:46.380
 normally a huge account and father 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.380
 of course for the ps3 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:01.310
 leipzig the ps3 so pure and then go 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:06.299
 You can then go to the register settings 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:10.590
 peripheral devices settings afterwards 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:15.569
 to emergency devices so bluetooth devices 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.650
 manage and then on new device 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.430
 to register 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.170
 I have of course already 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.940
 installed but I'll show you anyway 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.130
 how that works if you complete it 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.030
 From the beginning would make new heard 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.170
 to register 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.450
 like to start now here comes the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.900
 in quotes the difficulty 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:43.379
 she lives the heart and pushes 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.620
 Now on it until the led light up 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:54.450
 enormous headset alternating green and blue 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:59.400
 So it lights up the first time it works out 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.090
 with me somehow not contain so 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.130
 long pressed 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.959
 The factory is green and blue 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.739
 lit I show that it will be 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.139
 probably a bit now 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.250
 to be out of focus but as if it wants 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.230
 Of course, only blue 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.230
 that is of course before effect 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.380
 to 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 for the hundredth time 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:37.030
 that's what it looks like when it shines 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.139
 you often start clicking and then know 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.990
 now probably one with me 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.360
 error message come but you will then 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:51.220
 the corresponding headset is displayed 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:53.139
 will be found and how will be found 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.849
 this is definitely indicated and her 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:05.250
 be prompted the pass key 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:08.250
 to enter and this study said 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.810
 Bastian is in the manual 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.370
 So the people be there with me 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.800
 It was four times zero 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.800
 and this fits then goes on 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.879
 four times zero 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.930
 then on ok registration runs and then 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.640
 Registration is successful 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:40.250
 great and then you can do it the route 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:47.780
 already use but you go back then 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:50.300
 and occurs three times twice on circular and 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.800
 then you go on audi and devices 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:06:00.410
 attitudes and could then the 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.550
 sensitivity to us so set 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.590
 in that he is already set 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.200
 is that you see I have it now 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.270
 at 3 I find that relatively pleasant 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.010
 I did not have it on my ear I was not 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:18.100
 so would have a double talk and 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:21.080
 that will only me you can either up 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.000
 15 but then it would be too loud and 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.390
 over taxes so it goes up to the 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.410
 good to very good surface that he very much 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.990
 very uncomfortable 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:35.180
 that's why it's easy at three 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:38.840
 totally ok and jesus you go on 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.700
 ok, we input to input 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.990
 and output device that must be exactly exact 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.570
 be the same 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.400
 Then you click ok again and then 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.660
 you can be theoretical and start to 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.190
 play and use your headset what 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.800
 she could do too 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:07:01.340
 you can connect through your ps3 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.140
 either either disconnect or that 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.730
 connect the headset to the ps3 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.500
 but that falls a bit now 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:11.050
 awkward so just on the 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.550
 press power button four seconds on it 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.080
 and then it's either about to shape 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.120
 or I would turn off on everyone 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.460
 a lot of fun i hope i got it 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.940
 understandably explained if you are on each 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.930
 case should still have a few questions 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.850
 then she drives me either the 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.290
 comments or city ​​email me 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.400
 I will 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.130
 I'll answer you as soon as possible 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.380
 definitely liked the video 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.390
 you have to really have world 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.270
 a thumb tall happy if you mine 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:42.800
 channel and I'll just say it 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.800
 until the next time it
