00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.600 

all<00:00:01.350> right<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.770> gonna<00:00:01.860> be<00:00:02.040> looking<00:00:02.280> at

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
all right we're gonna be looking at

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.200 
all right we're gonna be looking at
steering<00:00:03.540> assemblies<00:00:04.549> so<00:00:05.549> there's<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.060> couple

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
steering assemblies so there's a couple

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.120 
steering assemblies so there's a couple
different<00:00:06.330> steering<00:00:06.750> racks<00:00:07.049> they<00:00:08.010> all

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
different steering racks they all

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190 
different steering racks they all
basically<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> same<00:00:08.910> principle<00:00:09.389> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
basically have the same principle this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.830 
basically have the same principle this
is<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.650> N<00:00:10.889> Load<00:00:11.070> rack<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.389> 8<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.750> 1/2

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
is a N Load rack right here so 8 and 1/2

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.770 
is a N Load rack right here so 8 and 1/2
inch<00:00:13.309> and<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.120> coupler<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
inch and it's got a little coupler on

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.660 
inch and it's got a little coupler on
the<00:00:15.870> end<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.650> little<00:00:16.920> coupler<00:00:17.190> room<00:00:17.369> here

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the end so this little coupler room here

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.300 
the end so this little coupler room here
is<00:00:18.090> where<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.140> attach<00:00:19.410> your<00:00:19.650> steering<00:00:19.980> so

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
is where you attach your steering so

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.150 
is where you attach your steering so
most<00:00:20.730> people<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.210> gonna<00:00:21.710> take<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.070> these

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
most people are gonna take one of these

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.710 
most people are gonna take one of these
u-joints<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> AC<00:00:25.109> 4<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.830> 5<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.970> 6<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> 0

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
u-joints this is a AC 4 to 5 to 6 is 0

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.500 
u-joints this is a AC 4 to 5 to 6 is 0
you<00:00:28.710> joint<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.670> basically<00:00:30.150> slide<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you joint and you basically slide it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.729 
you joint and you basically slide it
right<00:00:30.539> over<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.679> spine<00:00:32.219> coupler<00:00:33.620> fits<00:00:34.620> like

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
right over that spine coupler fits like

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.119 
right over that spine coupler fits like
that<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.940> that's<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> steer<00:00:37.020> okay<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that and that's how you steer okay the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
that and that's how you steer okay the
next<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.350> your

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
next thing you do is you take your

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.310 
next thing you do is you take your
steering<00:00:40.829> shaft<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.239> either<00:00:42.629> weld<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.140> or

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
steering shaft and you either weld it or

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
steering shaft and you either weld it or
insert<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> u<00:00:44.940> joint<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> come

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
insert it into this u joint so you come

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
insert it into this u joint so you come
up<00:00:46.079> your<00:00:46.260> steering<00:00:47.160> shaft<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.030> sand<00:00:48.300> rail

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
up your steering shaft on your sand rail

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
up your steering shaft on your sand rail
or<00:00:48.899> buggy<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.460> put

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
or buggy and then you're gonna put

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
or buggy and then you're gonna put
another<00:00:50.910> cup<00:00:51.210> another<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> join<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.440> one

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
another cup another you join in this one

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
another cup another you join in this one
here<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> 3/4<00:00:55.820> smooth<00:00:56.820> ride<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.870> 3/4<00:00:58.379> by

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
here is a 3/4 smooth ride it's a 3/4 by

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
here is a 3/4 smooth ride it's a 3/4 by
3/4<00:00:59.039> u<00:00:59.699> joint<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.420> typically<00:01:00.780> you're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
3/4 u joint so that's typically you're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.280 
3/4 u joint so that's typically you're
going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> 3/4<00:01:01.980> shaft<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.080> once

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
going to use a 3/4 shaft so then once

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.490 
going to use a 3/4 shaft so then once
you<00:01:04.580> get<00:01:05.580> close<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> shaft<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> end<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you get close the shaft to the end you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
you get close the shaft to the end you
install<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.729> u<00:01:08.880> joint<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.909> end<00:01:12.150> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
install the u joint on the other end so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.230 
install the u joint on the other end so
you<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> v1<00:01:13.020> over<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.909> right<00:01:14.909> here<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you have a v1 over here right here on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.609 
you have a v1 over here right here on
this<00:01:15.360> end<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.810> long<00:01:16.110> end<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.729> your

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
this end a long end and this is your

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
this end a long end and this is your
steering<00:01:19.619> shaft<00:01:20.000> hanger<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:21.570> get

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
steering shaft hanger so this will get

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.010 
steering shaft hanger so this will get
welded<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.000> your<00:01:24.000> crossbar<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.869> where

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
welded on to your crossbar for where

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.429 
welded on to your crossbar for where
your<00:01:25.140> steering<00:01:25.380> goes<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:27.229> steering<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
your steering goes and a steering a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
your steering goes and a steering a
short<00:01:29.430> shaft<00:01:29.670> through<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.960> attach

short shaft through this and then attach

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
short shaft through this and then attach
your<00:01:31.380> steering<00:01:31.650> will<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.250> end<00:01:32.520> or

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
your steering will out this end or

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
your steering will out this end or
standing<00:01:33.299> quick<00:01:33.479> disconnect

anyway thanks for taking a look that's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
anyway thanks for taking a look that's
the<00:01:36.450> basic<00:01:36.869> steering<00:01:37.229> setup<00:01:37.470> obviously

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the basic steering setup obviously

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
the basic steering setup obviously
there's<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:38.670> racks<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.840> but

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
there's different racks you can use but

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.140 
there's different racks you can use but
it's<00:01:40.560> still<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> same<00:01:40.979> setup<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's still the same setup now if you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's still the same setup now if you
experience<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> high<00:01:42.930> angle<00:01:43.259> situation<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
experience a high angle situation you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.929 
experience a high angle situation you
want<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.790> use<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.180> w<00:01:45.630> joints<00:01:46.020> ok

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
want to use one of these w joints ok

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.060 
want to use one of these w joints ok
they're<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.180> our<00:01:48.299> website<00:01:48.720> under<00:01:48.930> W<00:01:49.470> joints<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
they're on our website under W joints so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.679 
they're on our website under W joints so
these<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.549> gonna<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.119> 60<00:01:51.540> degrees

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
these are gonna go up to like 60 degrees

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.590 
these are gonna go up to like 60 degrees
or<00:01:51.930> something<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.680> some<00:01:53.460> most<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:54.270> time

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you'll be ok with a single u joint but

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
you'll be ok with a single u joint but
some<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> guys<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.000> running<00:01:57.259> like
