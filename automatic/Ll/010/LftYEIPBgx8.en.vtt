00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.160 
going to be a little sticky but that's
fine<00:02:19.700> we'll<00:02:20.120> make<00:02:20.299> it<00:02:20.329> work<00:02:20.660> don't<00:02:20.989> worry

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170

about it flour your work surface and
you're<00:02:26.959> just<00:02:27.260> gonna<00:02:27.500> literally<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.370> pull

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
you're just gonna literally have to pull

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.170 
you're just gonna literally have to pull
this<00:02:28.910> out<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:31.599> then<00:02:33.310> flour<00:02:34.310> your<00:02:34.519> hands<00:02:35.060> if

needed and need this for about a minute
or<00:02:38.329> so

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.060 

all<00:02:51.600> right<00:02:51.780> for<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.170> process<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.740> use<00:02:53.040> a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
all right for this process you can use a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.680 
all right for this process you can use a
rolling<00:02:53.340> pin<00:02:53.520> or<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.090> also<00:02:54.240> use<00:02:54.360> your

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
rolling pin or you can also use your

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.150 
rolling pin or you can also use your
hand<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.140> spread<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.470> around<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.950> will

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
hand just spread it around and we will

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.410 
hand just spread it around and we will
fold<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.700> four<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.390> five<00:03:00.840> times<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.910> now<00:03:03.060> I'm

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
fold this four to five times so now I'm

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.560 
fold this four to five times so now I'm
just<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.840> spread<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.380> filling<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:05.040> top

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:19.030 

and<00:03:09.860> then<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.190> start<00:03:11.459> folding

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.230 

and<00:03:19.159> then<00:03:19.790> turn<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.530 

and<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.960> again<00:03:25.230> roll<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.330> will

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
and then again roll it out and you will

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.750 
and then again roll it out and you will
repeat<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.470> mentioned<00:03:28.920> four<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.490> five

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
repeat this as I mentioned four to five

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.630 
repeat this as I mentioned four to five
times<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.990> layering<00:03:31.320> what<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.130> does<00:03:32.340> it

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
times this layering what it does it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.070 
times this layering what it does it
makes<00:03:32.880> those<00:03:33.120> nice<00:03:33.420> layers<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:35.580> also

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
makes those nice layers and it also

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.450 
makes those nice layers and it also
distributes<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.350> bacon<00:03:37.860> bits<00:03:38.010> evenly

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
distributes the bacon bits evenly

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.150 
distributes the bacon bits evenly
throughout<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.910> dough<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.860> you'd<00:03:41.010> like

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160

you want to use a cookie cutter you can

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.840 
you want to use a cookie cutter you can
see<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.410> layers<00:04:22.710> there<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.550> once<00:04:26.730> you

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
see all the layers there so once you

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.130 
see all the layers there so once you
have<00:04:26.880> them<00:04:27.120> all<00:04:27.330> cut<00:04:27.600> out<00:04:27.690> you're<00:04:27.930> going<00:04:28.050> to

put them on a baking sheet lined with

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.730 
put them on a baking sheet lined with
parchment<00:04:29.910> paper<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.990> could<00:04:31.140> also<00:04:31.320> cut<00:04:31.620> these

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
parchment paper you could also cut these

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.680 
parchment paper you could also cut these
in<00:04:31.950> small<00:04:32.220> triangles<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:32.910> would<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.240> perfect

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
in small triangles that would be perfect

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.080 
in small triangles that would be perfect
for<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.900> cocktail<00:04:34.140> party<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.920> then<00:04:35.760> don't

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
for a cocktail party and then don't

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.050 
for a cocktail party and then don't
forget<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.360> refold<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.650> scraps<00:04:38.040> this<00:04:38.790> way

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
forget to refold the scraps this way

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.680 
forget to refold the scraps this way
will<00:04:39.840> ensure<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.260> will<00:04:40.650> have<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.070> layers

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
will ensure that will have the layers

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.360 
will ensure that will have the layers
they're<00:04:42.690> just<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.140> just<00:04:43.320> repeat<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.950> folding

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370
