00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.580
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.500
 further product presentation yes we have 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.870
 yes today a day where the bait of 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.730
 Brand Jackson for you calls himself 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.010
 you get fish completely new on the market 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.040
 in four sizes starts at 8 cm goes 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.530
 then about 10 12 5 and 15 centimeters 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.270
 every size you get in each case 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.830
 ten colors I have the here now times 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.680
 most usual for you unpacked that we 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.270
 now here is a 12 5 centimeter variation 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 and here in the comparison times the ten 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.160
 centimeter you see the instant 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.530
 cooler is very very detailed 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.350
 processed by the coloring over here 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.720
 so details this hinged mouth the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.430
 3d eyes these bulbous fins here 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.960
 and this big tailfin, too 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.520
 again with the jackson resting on hangs 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.989
 Of course you can not go with it but you 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 Looks like that is very very valuable 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.730
 processed the market offers yes at present 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.870
 a wealth of rubber kÃ¶hler one asks 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.340
 of course legitimately 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.020
 we need more 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.880
 I think the jackson has one 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.950
 notion that not many rubbers 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.570
 Cooler meet if you compare 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.570
 Then fish with another rubber fish 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.999
 you already fresh from jackson 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.649
 it is much thicker 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.389
 of course, in reverse, also to 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.700
 Follow that cancellation phase significantly 

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:12.439
 takes longer and that's often the case 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.329
 where the bites take place that is called there 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.549
 definitely with a street length 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.069
 fish for the bait and bag the beautiful one 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.319
 I would also here the dickkopf 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.999
 not too hard to choose because of 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.159
 Strengths are in my opinion 

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:27.380
 in paragraph phase yes and through this 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.509
 bulbous body here too he has so 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.880
 Easily commute it from factual behavior or 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.409
 Generally also running behavior the larger ones 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.779
 you can also go through the water 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.329
 certainly also ideal for tenants 

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:40.130
 the smaller ones that way so i'll tell you 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.929
 a very classic zander kulabas 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 bait that we now have ten inches 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.799
 there is even one more night so 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240
 also a really good player and all the more 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.069
 greater afterwards are then evenly throughout 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 had different and pike yes in four sizes 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.310
 I mention ten colors what else 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.169
 interesting is I have them here now 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.849
 something divided for those 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:00.919
 worth so much among you 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.139
 put on it is the bait and v 

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:05.539
 of course there is also a reflection 

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:09.319
 Part v reflected again are with it 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.120
 Now here with the banks that's one 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.950
 for example, the same woman 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.019
 is reflective then we have here 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.459
 the silver shade has only details 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.620
 like this team I do not even know if 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.499
 you look so good on the video but the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.239
 team and the fins down this tv 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.969
 then reflect, there is the 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.219
 shrill colors like this pretty 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.780
 pink as it is the top again 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.180
 I think I see quite well and the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.700
 tailfin and woman reflect the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 motor oil on full length in any case 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.659
 a whole reflective kohler and 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.430
 also again the celebration part the 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.780
 for me that uv reflecting i 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.430
 So it's always crucial 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.469
 always a little better on it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 For example, if the comparison to the stuff 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.569
 and dad, there are others 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.120
 manufacturers the colors quiet times on 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.620
 that always means uv sent 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.359
 while the fanny is the same 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.549
 several bodies but I say so 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:02.299
 Of course this should be an ideal bait 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.620
 if you have a light water what 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.939
 not over it and maybe still 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.980
 Sunshine then I would rather to 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.989
 grab his color and this all 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.030
 are of course something for the dull 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.129
 waters is a very interesting one 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.049
 Coolers are also very good 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.060
 managed a few interesting things 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.310
 at the visor despite things completely 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.500
 Lifelike look over we have 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.909
 Now in shock and if you like the video 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.370
 Of course we would have liked it 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.689
 be glad if you write it to us easily 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.009
 also what in the comments if 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.780
 you have questions you always try 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.609
 to answer and best subscribed 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.229
 yes, we will watch our channel 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.340
 the next product presentation again 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.340
 See you next time
