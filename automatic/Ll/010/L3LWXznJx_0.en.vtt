00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.090 

one<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.630> main<00:00:00.840> problems<00:00:01.380> with<00:00:01.530> LED

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
one of the main problems with LED

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.039 
one of the main problems with LED
lighting<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.970> its<00:00:03.149> color<00:00:03.360> quality<00:00:03.870> can

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
lighting is that its color quality can

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.099 
lighting is that its color quality can
be<00:00:04.080> really<00:00:04.770> bad<00:00:04.950> for<00:00:05.330> example<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.810> a

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
be really bad for example this is a

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.200 
be really bad for example this is a
super<00:00:07.740> bright<00:00:07.950> flashlight<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.610> made<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> few

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
super bright flashlight I made a few

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.720 
super bright flashlight I made a few
videos<00:00:09.570> back<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.469> utilizes<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.519> those

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
videos back and it utilizes one of those

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
videos back and it utilizes one of those
cheap<00:00:12.210> cobb<00:00:12.840> LEDs<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.650> buy<00:00:13.889> from<00:00:14.130> eBay

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
cheap cobb LEDs you can buy from eBay

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.269 
cheap cobb LEDs you can buy from eBay
now<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> very<00:00:15.870> bright<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> light

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
now it is very bright but the light

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.510 
now it is very bright but the light
quality<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:18.240> pretty<00:00:18.810> bad<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:20.010> example<00:00:20.400> this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
quality is pretty bad for example this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
quality is pretty bad for example this
is<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> test<00:00:21.150> seen<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.960> shot<00:00:22.289> under<00:00:22.650> normal

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
is a test seen that shot under normal

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
is a test seen that shot under normal
daylight<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> window<00:00:24.420> off<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.869> my

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
daylight because as a window off to my

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
daylight because as a window off to my
left<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> looks<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> pretty<00:00:26.970> good

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
left and it looks you know pretty good

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960 
left and it looks you know pretty good
but<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.500> same<00:00:28.800> scene<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
but if we like the same scene with the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900 
but if we like the same scene with the
flashlight<00:00:30.720> bouncing<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> wall<00:00:31.910> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
flashlight bouncing it off a wall you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.430 
flashlight bouncing it off a wall you
can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> has<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> horrible<00:00:34.079> green

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
can see that it has a horrible green

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.000 
can see that it has a horrible green
cast<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:36.660> affects<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> skin<00:00:37.590> tones<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
cast and this affects the skin tones in

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
cast and this affects the skin tones in
particular<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.750> without

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
particular now this was without

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.290 
particular now this was without
adjusting<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> white<00:00:41.399> balance<00:00:41.820> settings<00:00:42.149> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
adjusting the white balance settings on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360 
adjusting the white balance settings on
the<00:00:42.390> camera<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.200> even<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.890> adjust<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the camera but even if we do adjust it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.779 
the camera but even if we do adjust it
to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> LED<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.629> green<00:00:45.899> tint<00:00:46.410> still<00:00:47.129> persists

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to the LED the green tint still persists

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
to the LED the green tint still persists
in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> skin<00:00:48.450> tones<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.230> look<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> bit

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
in the skin tones and they look a bit

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.819 
in the skin tones and they look a bit
pale<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.750> exemplifies<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pale and this really exemplifies the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.540 
pale and this really exemplifies the
effect<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.489> low<00:00:53.969> CRI<00:00:54.660> lighting<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:56.070> really

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
effect of low CRI lighting as it really

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
effect of low CRI lighting as it really
does<00:00:56.789> affect<00:00:56.969> skin<00:00:57.390> tones<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> particular<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
does affect skin tones in particular and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
does affect skin tones in particular and
it<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.430> people<00:00:59.489> look<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.480> ill

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it can make people look a bit ill

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
it can make people look a bit ill
essentially<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.699> poses<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.180> real

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
essentially and this poses a real

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.440 
essentially and this poses a real
problem<00:01:03.930> towards<00:01:04.619> DIYs<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.909> LEDs

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
problem towards DIYs because what LEDs

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469 
problem towards DIYs because what LEDs
can<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.260> our<00:01:07.770> projects<00:01:08.549> well

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
can we use for our projects well

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
can we use for our projects well
thankfully<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:10.799> manufacturer

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
thankfully there is one manufacturer

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.109 
thankfully there is one manufacturer
called<00:01:11.909> ug<00:01:12.479> LED<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.680> does<00:01:14.010> make<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.490> version

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
called ug LED that does make a version

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
called ug LED that does make a version
of<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.509> style<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> LED<00:01:16.580> but<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.729> high

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of this style of LED but with high

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.179 
of this style of LED but with high
quality<00:01:18.000> phosphor<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> light<00:01:19.710> given<00:01:20.100> off

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
quality phosphor so the light given off

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
quality phosphor so the light given off
is<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> extremely<00:01:21.210> high<00:01:21.659> quality<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is of extremely high quality and the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.060 
is of extremely high quality and the
result<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.509> emit<00:01:24.960> light<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
result is that they emit light that is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
result is that they emit light that is
almost<00:01:26.460> indistinguishable<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.570> real

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
almost indistinguishable from real

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
almost indistinguishable from real

set<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.110> test<00:01:31.380> scene<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> cardboard<00:01:32.340> box

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
set up a test scene in a cardboard box

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
set up a test scene in a cardboard box
and<00:01:33.090> covered<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.570> diffuser<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and covered it with a diffuser this is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
and covered it with a diffuser this is
outside<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> course<00:01:35.729> under<00:01:36.000> direct<00:01:36.450> sunlight

outside of course under direct sunlight

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960 
outside of course under direct sunlight
and<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.619> looks<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.009> good<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> colors<00:01:38.850> are

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and it looks pretty good the colors are

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 
and it looks pretty good the colors are
accurate<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> vibrant<00:01:40.579> now<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.880> try<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
accurate and vibrant now if we try it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.780 
accurate and vibrant now if we try it
indoors<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> ug<00:01:43.439> LED<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
indoors with the ug LED you can see that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
indoors with the ug LED you can see that
the<00:01:44.909> colors<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.390> pretty<00:01:45.630> much<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.500> now

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the colors are pretty much the same now

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
the colors are pretty much the same now
there<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.579> some<00:01:47.790> slight<00:01:48.000> variations<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there are some slight variations in the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
there are some slight variations in the
colors<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.710> they're<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.130> minor<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> they

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
colors but they're so minor that they

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
colors but they're so minor that they
wouldn't<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.299> noticed<00:01:51.509> outside<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> direct

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
wouldn't be noticed outside of a direct

wouldn't be noticed outside of a direct
comparison<00:01:53.360> now<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.540> LED<00:01:54.899> absolutely<00:01:55.890> blew

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
comparison now this LED absolutely blew

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.940 
comparison now this LED absolutely blew
my<00:01:56.430> socks<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.299> when<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.509> first<00:01:57.899> saw<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.259> because

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
my socks off when I first saw it because

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.990 
my socks off when I first saw it because
to<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> eye<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:01.259> does<00:02:01.530> resemble

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
to the eye it really does resemble

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
to the eye it really does resemble
genuine<00:02:03.000> sunlight<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:04.259> though<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> know

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
genuine sunlight even though you know

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
genuine sunlight even though you know
it's<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.700> had<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.420> around<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> house

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it's not and had to go around the house

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's not and had to go around the house
showing<00:02:07.200> everyone<00:02:07.560> how<00:02:07.890> good<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.700> LED<00:02:09.209> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
showing everyone how good this LED is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.690 
showing everyone how good this LED is
because<00:02:10.140> I've<00:02:10.259> never<00:02:10.379> seen<00:02:10.500> such<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> high

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because I've never seen such a high

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.350 
because I've never seen such a high
quality<00:02:11.760> light<00:02:12.660> output<00:02:13.080> from

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
quality light output from

quality light output from
anything<00:02:13.660> other<00:02:13.810> than<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.140> Sun<00:02:14.320> itself<00:02:14.680> and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
anything other than the Sun itself and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.610 
anything other than the Sun itself and
it<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.510> phenomenal

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it really is phenomenal

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.070 
it really is phenomenal
now<00:02:18.160> also<00:02:18.490> tested<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:18.970> light<00:02:19.210> output<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
now also tested the light output with a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 
now also tested the light output with a
spectrophotometer<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.430> reported<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.480> CRI

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
spectrophotometer and reported a CRI

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.430 
spectrophotometer and reported a CRI
value<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.740> whopping<00:02:24.280> ninety<00:02:24.940> six<00:02:25.510> which<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
value of a whopping ninety six which is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.370 
value of a whopping ninety six which is
almost<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.070> highest<00:02:27.490> value<00:02:27.910> possible<00:02:28.380> in

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
almost the highest value possible in

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.550 
almost the highest value possible in
comparison<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> cheap<00:02:30.430> LED<00:02:30.610> only<00:02:31.150> got<00:02:31.390> 69<00:02:31.930> so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
comparison the cheap LED only got 69 so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.680 
comparison the cheap LED only got 69 so
it's<00:02:33.100> no<00:02:33.310> wonder<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.760> looks<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.150> bad<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:34.540> that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it's no wonder it looks so bad in that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.380 
it's no wonder it looks so bad in that
comparison<00:02:35.110> earlier<00:02:35.820> I'm<00:02:36.820> speaking<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.240> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
comparison earlier I'm speaking of that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.660 
comparison earlier I'm speaking of that
comparison<00:02:37.720> let's<00:02:38.350> try<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.710> again<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
comparison let's try it again with the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.460 
comparison let's try it again with the
cheap<00:02:40.000> LED<00:02:40.380> versus<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.890> ug<00:02:42.550> LED<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:44.140> yes

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
cheap LED versus the ug LED and yes

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.800 
cheap LED versus the ug LED and yes
that's<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.310> ug<00:02:45.640> LED<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.180> right<00:02:46.330> not

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that's the ug LED on the right not

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.199 
that's the ug LED on the right not
sunlight<00:02:47.530> now<00:02:47.950> after<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.250> saw<00:02:48.430> these<00:02:48.610> results<00:02:49.090> I

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
sunlight now after I saw these results I

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.970 
sunlight now after I saw these results I
decided<00:02:49.660> there<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.020> then<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.590> I'm

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
decided there and then that I'm

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440 
decided there and then that I'm
definitely<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.880> make<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> video

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
definitely going to have to make a video

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.170 
definitely going to have to make a video
light<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.770> LED<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:54.910> easy

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
light with this LED because it's so easy

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.960 
light with this LED because it's so easy
to<00:02:55.739> maybe<00:02:56.739> daylight<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:57.550> it

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
to maybe daylight with it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.270 
to maybe daylight with it
now<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.780> quality<00:02:59.260> light<00:02:59.410> output<00:02:59.920> does<00:03:00.100> come

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
now this quality light output does come

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.800 
now this quality light output does come
as<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.459> bit<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.760> price<00:03:01.090> because<00:03:01.570> there<00:03:01.750> are

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
as a bit of a price because there are

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
as a bit of a price because there are
about<00:03:01.959> 10<00:03:02.320> times<00:03:02.530> more<00:03:02.770> expensive<00:03:03.370> than<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
about 10 times more expensive than the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.050 
about 10 times more expensive than the
cheap<00:03:04.150> ones<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.570> can<00:03:04.720> get<00:03:04.840> from<00:03:05.050> eBay<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.850> for

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
cheap ones you can get from eBay but for

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.030 
cheap ones you can get from eBay but for
me<00:03:07.180> that's<00:03:07.360> well<00:03:08.020> worth<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.560> because<00:03:08.709> if

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
me that's well worth it because if

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.410 
me that's well worth it because if
you're<00:03:09.160> going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> spend<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> time<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:10.030> make

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
you're going to spend the time to make

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.449 
you're going to spend the time to make
something<00:03:10.840> like<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.650> anything<00:03:12.160> other

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
something like this for anything other

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.570 
something like this for anything other
than<00:03:12.640> just<00:03:13.000> general<00:03:13.390> illumination<00:03:13.739> then<00:03:14.739> you

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
than just general illumination then you

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.340 
than just general illumination then you
want<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.880> use<00:03:16.420> something<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:16.959> going<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
want to use something that's going to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.259 
want to use something that's going to
give<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.650> good<00:03:17.890> quality<00:03:18.070> light<00:03:18.489> output<00:03:19.120> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
give you a good quality light output and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.960 
give you a good quality light output and
this<00:03:19.540> does<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.260> spades<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.910> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
this does that in spades now the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.440 
this does that in spades now the
manufacturer<00:03:22.690> ug<00:03:23.320> LED<00:03:23.650> does<00:03:23.920> sell<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.459> warm

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
manufacturer ug LED does sell a warm

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.240 
manufacturer ug LED does sell a warm
white<00:03:25.660> version<00:03:26.140> which<00:03:26.320> could<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.650> very<00:03:26.680> useful

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
white version which could be very useful

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.250 
white version which could be very useful
for<00:03:27.280> home<00:03:27.640> lighting<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.630> personally<00:03:28.959> quite

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
for home lighting but I personally quite

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.190 
for home lighting but I personally quite
liked<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:30.420> daylight<00:03:31.420> balanced<00:03:31.870> version

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
liked the daylight balanced version

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.410 
liked the daylight balanced version
because<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.560> has<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> warmth<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:34.269> of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
because it has a warmth to it because of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300 
because it has a warmth to it because of
the<00:03:34.540> accurate<00:03:34.870> color<00:03:35.080> which<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.920> something<00:03:36.130> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
the accurate color which is something I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.150 
the accurate color which is something I
was<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:36.730> expecting<00:03:36.970> at<00:03:37.330> all<00:03:37.480> now<00:03:38.440> another

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
was not expecting at all now another

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.430 
was not expecting at all now another
thing<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.209> ITR<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.720> LEDs<00:03:41.200> are

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
thing is that the ITR I LEDs are

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.560 
thing is that the ITR I LEDs are
surprisingly<00:03:42.040> quite<00:03:42.370> hard<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.670> find<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
surprisingly quite hard to find on the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.320 
surprisingly quite hard to find on the
general<00:03:43.930> market<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.580> brilliant<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.299> see

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
general market so it's brilliant to see

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.080 
general market so it's brilliant to see
