00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.919
 good josé arango with you again with the uu guidelines 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.299
 we had said it is past that the 3 of the modern has maybe only four 

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:22.839
 fundamental tools 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.489
 the first one was this basic price series traffic 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.179
 We are going to look at a little bit after seeing this beautiful photo 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.700
 what are the Japanese candles and what we are interested in 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.970
 and that summary way of course we are producing a seminar only 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.030
 about these peace tools 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.950
 but there is a whole 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.610
 world around the japanese candles a lot of history a lot of superstition 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 and a lot of trickery 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.470
 There are names like jara mis 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.820
 starry skies starless sky and so on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.650
 us in the seminar that we are dictating we are going to see 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.020
 very powerful tools that replace all this 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 but if we re-peg some aspects of the sails that are important 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.119
 specifically the wide range network that have percent 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.140
 larger than the other two times the average 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.110
 usually 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.910
 begin or end movements and tell us that some or other buyers and 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.820
 sellers 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.710
 they had control of the auction for a long time and they took the market 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.960
 balance 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 here we have wide range candles ending this movement this is what 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.730
 They are weighing a new upward movement 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.049
 Narrow-range sails are not as powerful as the previous ones 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.490
 and it tells us that buyers and sellers did not have too many 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 differences 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.390
 with respect to the price 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.719
 the tails sindic that buyers and sellers and they exchanged 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.939
 control of the market during the time the sale was built 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.930
 they are a marker of volatility or indecision 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.970
 the long-tailed tails tell us that after the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.550
 that buyers took control 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.880
 new sellers appeared ibarrola 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.079
 the price of the new with point 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.669
 very close to opening 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.799
 the sails then not only allow us to see that it was physically the prices of 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.219
 closing and opening 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.419
 but they contain in themselves a 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.080
 that tells us about the characteristics of leaks 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.050
 through them we can see the emotions of buyers and sellers 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.149
 and make a deeper reading of the markets 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.109
 one could practice 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.550
 to try not only to say 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.430
 what is the opening price the minimum closing price and so on in wood 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.229
 with that 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.809
 but to be a reading exercise of what happened inside 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.619
 of the auction 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.329
 look for example if we eat to start state was great that here we 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.370
 we could say that the average price at this level 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.029
 Right 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.139
 sorry 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.329
 the price well this level 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.019
 in weight to be sold tremendously opened to carrió sorry it began to be sold to 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.099
 sold to be sold in active this was for the floors anyway of 6 of 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.639
 May 2010 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.310
 continue to see it continued to be sent and when it came to these 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.959
 such terrible levels 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.180
 then the buyers appeared again 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.849
 and the asset came to this prisoner 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.120
 the next day that happened the next day the price returned practically to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.489
 same level where it had closed 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.050
 quickly began some buyers to raise the price 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.619
 but they could not hold back, the being started again at this point 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.409
 and finally they appeared again against 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.090
 the next day the asset died on this site 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.930
 and it was the comparators that were in control of the auction 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 during all the time 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.959
 they took the maximum price to this point 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.219
 and there was some offer at that time and closed here 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.720
 that is the correct way to read 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
 candlesticks
