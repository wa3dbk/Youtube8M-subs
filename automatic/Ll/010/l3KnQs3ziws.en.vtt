00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.639
 here should be welcome to another 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.949
 video of me ever said before 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.199
 I'm so sorry if the picture and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.570
 audio quality i am lousy i can 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 right now in front of video price 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 back and the light is exaggerated 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.050
 So it really only shit when I am 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 the laptop now also full of brightness 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.120
 have the light so reasonably okay 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.190
 and it's having it right now 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 the normal webcam camera from 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 my laptop and that is stupid 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.940
 Somehow, if I'm still with this 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.550
 record the headset in parallel like me 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 it always did otherwise 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.210
 somehow the audio track is like that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 the picture trail he then said of that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 Video here from the laptop always totally 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 delayed with that of my px 21 what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 I then record and then I have to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.680
 Always divide into pieces and you always 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.270
 try a bit in sync 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.329
 to cut it together and that's why I have 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.890
 namely me thought it just so on 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.869
 and yes, in any case, I am 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 just come back from there only once 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 It was just a cool evening in the evening 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.369
 so I say I have marcel 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.869
 first hopper air affected 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.430
 even started i just get it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.530
 off the train we go down directly 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.670
 But I do not care about that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 played and then you can really 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 first beating all the policemen 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.850
 took a run around and total 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 messed up like that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.439
 then wanted us in such an info because 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.939
 then closes expert just once 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.320
 the next brawl then the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.240
 then come to us before then comes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 we are still fast elsewhere and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.500
 Construction workers no impression in any case 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.970
 yes then we ran until then then 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.220
 yes are just so then on you could already 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 so the fans full of no idea of 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.770
 golf lloyd and so on all sorts 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 people and thus shows the red carpet and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.250
 so on next to me one 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 hour to wait at all the inlet 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 did not start that way and that's good 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 but it was reasonably warm and me 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 just had it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.879
 you have and have to be that way until you are 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.810
 so keep shitting and I had to 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.819
 realize that a little bit different 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.700
 So I have to say that 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.040
 It was a bit more disconnected 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.540
 but it was not so cool you can 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 when it's drinking outside a bit 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.580
 a little something and something and eat 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.319
 then we all went in and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.150
 I met in the box today 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.680
 think the picture of me I will 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.760
 now we have to use something 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.769
 the nama affected and yes then that has 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.180
 whole was started by yukon class 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.760
 moderated the goods really top 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.769
 made and was really fun pretty much 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.480
 funny but a few such a couple cool 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.560
 Scenes and inserts were there I know 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.110
 not who of you might have seen 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.090
 has for rostocks for example for the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.660
 Gunfight going on and it was really cool 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.849
 made 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.340
 yes and then you can do the whole 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.400
 nominations and then came the first of the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.280
 boss and god of course all three 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.950
 Prices dusted and the first 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.840
 Bavarian films just with and 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.239
 people what happened there 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.560
 I cut it a try purely must 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.560
 Just see it for yourself 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:49.730
 in serious danger 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:51.580
 I would like to see this price 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.030
 please to my friends 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:01.299
 he just pulls the courses and easy 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.299
 the pants down quickly with the type 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.690
 I have a very contrary 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:27.700
 I have the feeling colleague has with 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.380
 the whole a bit unpopular 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.750
 I have to say honestly to the audience 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.490
 because then have significantly fewer people 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.350
 clapped and thus their two prices 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.890
 also have gotten some 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.350
 people booked and so on but stop 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.910
 I do not think so seriously 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.440
 He does not have all that 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.350
 fucked up because he first times something 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.260
 he in itself was really blatant and right 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.170
 cool funny evening some categories 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.130
 For me personally, they do not stop like that 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.480
 appealing there were some things that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.130
 iucn me simply not as 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.410
 summarized in itself it was really a 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.900
 super horny super funny evening man 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.870
 has seen many faces and many 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.370
 well-known people also seen and yes everything 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.020
 again so to see the people in real life 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.340
 and hopefully something else 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.360
 and yes I have to say honestly 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.090
 Of course , I have the boss on the boss 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.070
 Most of us were happy and not what 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.320
 really super cool evening can 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.800
 So I always went back to find it real 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.630
 hot 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.000
 and there was, of course, now, unfortunately, 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.550
 really not much from the cd community 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.440
 there and the only cd video what synonymous 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.530
 was nominated by commander warrior 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.240
 live comments and yes there is everyone 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.620
 more case I hope that somehow 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.350
 next year a little bit 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.669
 more from the cod community so what 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.500
 is brought in because there is 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.210
 I really think there is a lot of potential 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.820
 us in our side of many others 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.620
 youtuber da that also mini for that 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.320
 because we give, of course 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.820
 a lot of work in and the whole thing 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.080
 should be rewarded even if 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.030
 it's a game from 18 or so and there 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.070
 is just a lot done, I think 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.960
 and that just has potential for something 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.400
 and that's why i hope next year 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.810
 In any case, what will be there 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.810
 and then I'll say it
