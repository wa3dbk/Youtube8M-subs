to<00:00:38.070> buy<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> I've<00:00:39.690> used<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.290> several

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
to buy so I've used this for several

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.740 
to buy so I've used this for several
things<00:00:40.829> mostly<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.820> mounting<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> monitor<00:00:42.600> on

but<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.050> problem<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.440> had<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
but one problem I had with this was this

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.000 
but one problem I had with this was this
chair<00:00:47.850> tip<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.420> kept<00:00:49.050> getting<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> hole<00:00:49.590> eaten

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
chair tip here kept getting a hole eaten
in<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> by<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> end<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.030> screw<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.050> even

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
in it by the end of this screw and even

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
in it by the end of this screw and even
when<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> nut<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.190> mentioned<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
when I put a nut as mentioned in the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.630 
when I put a nut as mentioned in the
video<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.079> frugal<00:00:55.379> clamp<00:00:55.620> video<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.399> put<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
video the frugal clamp video and I put a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
video the frugal clamp video and I put a
nut<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> bottom<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> absorb<00:00:57.809> some

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
nut in the bottom of this to absorb some

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
nut in the bottom of this to absorb some
of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.730> friction<00:00:59.730> from<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.809> still<00:01:01.140> would

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
of the friction from this it still would

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
of the friction from this it still would
punch<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> hole<00:01:02.219> only<00:01:02.489> after<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> few<00:01:03.059> uses<00:01:03.270> in

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
punch a hole only after a few uses in

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
punch a hole only after a few uses in
the<00:01:03.780> bottom<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.260> chair<00:01:04.559> tip<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> needed

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the bottom of this chair tip so I needed

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
the bottom of this chair tip so I needed
a<00:01:06.270> way<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> fix<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.460> even<00:01:08.460> though<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a way to fix that and even though I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
a way to fix that and even though I
didn't<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:08.909> come<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.330> anything<00:01:09.479> on

now<00:01:42.930> Brian<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.439> uses<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.340> by<00:01:44.759> itself

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
now Brian just uses this by by itself

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
now Brian just uses this by by itself
but<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> still<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.680> having<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.159> larger

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
but I still like having this larger

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.310 
but I still like having this larger
chair<00:01:47.759> tip<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> rubber<00:01:49.110> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
chair tip because the way the rubber is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289 
chair tip because the way the rubber is
set<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.369> gives<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> little<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.850> flex

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
set up it just gives a little more flex

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
set up it just gives a little more flex
here<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> end<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> conforms<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
here in the end and kind of conforms to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
here in the end and kind of conforms to
whatever<00:01:54.320> rounded<00:01:55.320> object<00:01:55.710> you're<00:01:55.829> around

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
whatever rounded object you're around

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
whatever rounded object you're around
like<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> tripod<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.840> instead<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
like a tripod like I think it instead of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
like a tripod like I think it instead of
having<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.860> point<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.700> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
having just one point here this kind of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
having just one point here this kind of
bends<00:02:00.060> around<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.659> gives<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.619> bit<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
bends around it gives it a little bit of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
bends around it gives it a little bit of
absorption<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:02.939> bit<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.149> padding<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
absorption a little bit of padding so I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.200 
absorption a little bit of padding so I
like<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.920> shove<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.000> on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
like that so now I just shove this on

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.459 
like that so now I just shove this on
the<00:02:06.329> end<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.630> even<00:02:06.810> need<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> gaffers

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
the end I don't even need the gaffers

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.180 
the end I don't even need the gaffers
tape<00:02:07.500> anymore

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
tape anymore

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
tape anymore
and<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.030> fits<00:02:09.209> perfectly<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and it fits perfectly so I think that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.210 
and it fits perfectly so I think that
was<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> great<00:02:10.679> solution

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
was a great solution

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.310 
was a great solution
from<00:02:13.000> Brian<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.810> wanted<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.140> pass

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
from Brian and I just wanted to pass

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.810 
from Brian and I just wanted to pass
that<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:15.400> important

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
that on to you think that's important

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.190 
that on to you think that's important
you've<00:02:15.910> got<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.180> frugal<00:02:16.510> clamp<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.960> use

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you've got the frugal clamp and you use

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.330 
you've got the frugal clamp and you use
it<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.470> might<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.800> know<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:17.980> this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it you might want to know about this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.370 
it you might want to know about this
another<00:02:19.240> thing<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.480> kind<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.750> came<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:20.050> with<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
another thing I kind of came up with and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.660 
another thing I kind of came up with and
you<00:02:20.440> might<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.680> noticed<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.370> frugal

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you might have noticed this in a frugal

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.940 
you might have noticed this in a frugal
crane<00:02:21.820> 2.0<00:02:22.390> video<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.770> want<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
crane 2.0 video is that if you want to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.000 
crane 2.0 video is that if you want to
extend<00:02:24.460> this<00:02:25.180> tripod<00:02:26.020> mount<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.380> top<00:02:26.410> here<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
extend this tripod mount on top here you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.370 
extend this tripod mount on top here you
can<00:02:27.070> get<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> coupler<00:02:27.670> nut<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.170> just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
can get a coupler nut like this is just

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.830 
can get a coupler nut like this is just
an<00:02:29.500> elongated<00:02:30.010> nut<00:02:30.280> basically<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.120> I've<00:02:31.600> put

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
an elongated nut basically and I've put

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.860 
an elongated nut basically and I've put
up<00:02:32.020> some<00:02:32.350> quarter-inch<00:02:33.130> thread<00:02:33.690> threaded<00:02:34.690> rod

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
up some quarter-inch thread threaded rod

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.540 
up some quarter-inch thread threaded rod
in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> end<00:02:35.380> here<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.800> headed<00:02:35.980> up<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.340> few

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
in the end here and headed up a few

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.060 
in the end here and headed up a few
threads<00:02:36.820> on<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.480> top<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.290> now<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.500> basically<00:02:38.920> am

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
threads on the top so now I basically am

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.340 
threads on the top so now I basically am
mimicking<00:02:39.490> this<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.570> now<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.050> just<00:02:41.230> give

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
mimicking this and now I can just give

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.440 
mimicking this and now I can just give
myself<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.740> little<00:02:41.770> bit<00:02:42.040> more<00:02:42.190> length<00:02:42.460> on<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
myself a little bit more length on the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.300 
myself a little bit more length on the
end<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.810> device<00:02:44.710> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
end of this device here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.710 
end of this device here
this<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.700> good<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:45.970> when<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.210> mount<00:02:46.630> my

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this is good for when I mount my

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.030 
this is good for when I mount my
monitors<00:02:47.260> probably<00:02:47.650> saw<00:02:47.740> in<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:47.860> previous

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
monitors probably saw in that previous

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.740 
monitors probably saw in that previous
video<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:48.850> anything<00:02:49.180> else<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.660> now

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
video but for anything else you can now

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.680 
video but for anything else you can now
kind<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.990> extend<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.680> top<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:52.090> thread<00:02:52.480> on

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
kind of extend the top of the thread on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.560 
kind of extend the top of the thread on
the<00:02:52.840> mini<00:02:53.710> ball<00:02:53.920> head<00:02:54.160> right<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.090> that's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the mini ball head right here so that's

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.720 
the mini ball head right here so that's
basically<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.080> those<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:56.560> some<00:02:56.800> frugal<00:02:57.490> clamp

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
basically it those are some frugal clamp

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.800 
basically it those are some frugal clamp
1.5<00:02:59.070> improvements<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.250> if<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.420> use<00:03:01.630> this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
1.5 improvements and if you use this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.510 
1.5 improvements and if you use this
device<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.650> might<00:03:02.890> be<00:03:03.010> able<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.250> use<00:03:03.370> these

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
device you might be able to use these

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.730 
device you might be able to use these
ideas<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.240> if<00:03:04.300> not<00:03:04.510> then<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.440> guess<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.710> can

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
ideas and if not then I guess you can

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.290 
ideas and if not then I guess you can
skip<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.220> video<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:06.700> if<00:03:06.790> you've<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.210> know

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
skip this video but if you've you know

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.940 
skip this video but if you've you know
done<00:03:07.570> something<00:03:08.080> like<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.350> maybe<00:03:08.860> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
done something like this maybe to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.410 
done something like this maybe to
improve<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.520> or<00:03:09.670> anything<00:03:09.970> else<00:03:10.150> let<00:03:10.390> me

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
improve this or anything else let me

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.800 
improve this or anything else let me
know

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
know

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.210 
know
but<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.230> thought<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.530> might<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:12.040> know

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
but I thought you might like to know
