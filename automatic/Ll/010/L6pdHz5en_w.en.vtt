00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 o3 being released today is a lot more 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.140
 and development of a brand new car 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.870
 Model is a car, you 're investing a lot. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.420
 more in weight loss or is it a car 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.889
 80 lbs lighter which allows you to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 you have less consumption of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 less emissions of pollutants is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 a car with one is already with the new line 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 headlamp with fully-charged LED 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.880
 fixed line additionally you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.330
 has inside the vehicle itself a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 line is clean a clear line in. 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.719
 the panel where you can 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 get around it which gives a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 much larger amplitude into the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 vehicle as well as the design itself and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.210
 the acceleration of the vehicle now has this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
 vehicle as well as counting on the exchange of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 dual clutch and seven gears that exchange 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.230
 and in a minute he even switches from 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 march more of it alone than each march 0.2 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 seconds or in a second he switches 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.520
 five times of walking is much more 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 inclusive formula 1 is a carrier 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.140
 which is fully adapted for the city 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 about the trip and today the possibility 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.470
 what we are doing is your vehicle in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.439
 two engine versions a version of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.049
 122 horses in the 180 horsepower version 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.689
 the 122 horsepower version have indexes of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 consumption around 14 15 km 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.950
 per liter which still brings an economy 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 even bigger shows really caldi is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.299
 is focused on reducing 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 emission of pollutants and the reduction of 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.840
 fuel consumption 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 the trend today the automotive market 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.290
 really is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.320
 you have cars with less 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.840
 engine size is higher and lower 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.939
 consumption with good performance 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.049
 example of this is the 3 today who 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.890
 has the same performance as the vehicle 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 above or above being 24 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 power of 20 horses less being 80 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.110
 lighter pounds 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 example of this are the cars have 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.509
 launched today as for example cars 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 of the line s 7s 6s eight are vehicles of 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.649
 eight cylinders only depending on the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.119
 use and the need for the engine 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 it starts to operate with four cylinders 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.259
 causing a huge reduction in consumption 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.880
 of fuel and bringing an autonomy 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.710
 driver is still much larger 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 this whole investment has been taking place and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.909
 has been increasing in Europe and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 the big 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.629
 it is a fruitful recognition that we have 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.769
 this technology may land here 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.050
 in Brazil is at the disposal of our 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.030
 consumer of the entire Brazilian people with 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.470
 that all this technology and this level 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.569
 comfort and reduction of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.940
 fuel 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.060
 we want more and more to bring the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.150
 consumer and the public should 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.190
 inside is daud and nothing better than a 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 structure consistent with the strength of 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.390
 brand audi the strength of the eurobike group 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.069
 in Brazil specifically here on the river 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.860
 south so we did it with 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.650
 very affection, with great ambitions 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.760
 to strengthen the presence of 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.000
 from audi 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 today looks at the eurobike group has 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.640
 state of rio grande do sul that the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.860
 politically in porto alegre a 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.239
 very great relevance is because we 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.200
 we have several brands here 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.030
 representatives 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.010
 then the great river of the south without 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 welcomed in a very loving way 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.970
 so we always keep investing 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.160
 of rio do sul and time of service in 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.660
 terms of structure to have a 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.540
 increasingly strong presence and a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.579
 retribution we are doing aa 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
 population elapsed this we 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.160
 we have a peak but we have other brands of 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.019
 trumpets volvo we have land we have 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.810
 jaguar then the conglomerate of brands 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.549
 nor to attend the public then 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.290
 strategically speaking of rio do sul 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.700
 is of relevant importance because the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.700
 work success work
