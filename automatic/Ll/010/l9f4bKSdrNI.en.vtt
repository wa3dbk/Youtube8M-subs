we're gonna do a blues progression using

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
we're gonna do a blues progression using
four<00:00:54.809> shapes<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> found<00:00:55.890> work<00:00:56.100> really

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
four shapes that I found work really

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.850 
four shapes that I found work really
well<00:00:56.850> over<00:00:57.120> blues<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.260> there's<00:00:58.410> their

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
well over blues because there's their

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.790 
well over blues because there's their
dominant<00:00:59.489> seventh<00:00:59.940> shapes<00:01:00.719> dominant<00:01:01.469> seventh

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
dominant seventh shapes dominant seventh

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 
dominant seventh shapes dominant seventh
is<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:03.239> bluesy<00:01:03.690> chord<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.259> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
is that bluesy chord that has that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.700 
is that bluesy chord that has that
seventh<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.810> okay<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.470> first

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
seventh in there okay and the first

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.039 
seventh in there okay and the first
shape<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.180> open<00:01:09.659> court

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
shape is the open court

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
shape is the open court
just<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.950> played<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.000> second<00:01:12.360> shape<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
just like I played the second shape is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
just like I played the second shape is
based<00:01:13.619> off<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.070> d7<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.299> slide<00:01:15.510> up

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
based off of a d7 that you just slide up

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.399 
based off of a d7 that you just slide up
two<00:01:15.840> frets<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> third<00:01:17.670> shape<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.930> based<00:01:19.200> off

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
two frets the third shape is based off

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.640 
two frets the third shape is based off
of<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.710> open<00:01:20.220> chord<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> b7<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
of an open chord of a b7 if that's a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.980 
of an open chord of a b7 if that's a
chord<00:01:22.890> you've<00:01:23.040> learned<00:01:23.310> before<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
chord you've learned before you just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
chord you've learned before you just
slide<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> seventh<00:01:26.580> fret<00:01:26.759> there

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
slide it up to the seventh fret there

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.190 
slide it up to the seventh fret there
and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:29.030> fourth<00:01:30.030> shape<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> based<00:01:30.990> off

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and then the fourth shape is based off

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.010 
and then the fourth shape is based off
of<00:01:31.229> an<00:01:31.500> a7<00:01:32.189> open<00:01:32.759> chord<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.780> slide

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
of an a7 open chord and you just slide

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.700 
of an a7 open chord and you just slide
it<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> ninth<00:01:35.700> fret<00:01:35.939> here

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it all the way up to the ninth fret here

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.500 
it all the way up to the ninth fret here
okay<00:01:37.710> those<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.130> four<00:01:38.970> shapes<00:01:39.300> that<00:01:39.390> I'm
