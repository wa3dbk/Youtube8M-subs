00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:11.340

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:14.670
 do you want for us as processes 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.460
 amd fx-6300 the place this this 390 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.480
 euro has six rates the we socks is on 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 3 plus 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 speed is 3.5 gigahertz five six 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 course and why is it super chill because 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 games for example the new games 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.779
 battlefield 4 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 he already recommends the coach through 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.809
 livestream and so just use a lot 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 Corps name is convenient to six or four 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.680
 costs may have 8 crust maybe 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 again a little overkill but in one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 few years it would be good so 6 kois 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 is as motherboard have the asrock 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.520
 970 pro 3 and really two point zero 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 this to 3 to 3 plus motherboard you 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
 just atx 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.510
 yes you can overclock with the thing it has 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 also no hdmi or blood does but usb 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 3 point 0 wlan usb 2 point 0 he 60 euros 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.399
 you can then overclock a little 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
 but not really bad or just that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.659
 shows that do not really do the self or 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.270
 to get to the hard drive the hard drive 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.260
 is a western digital blue caviar one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 terabyte 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 There were six 107,000 John Pak and 50 euros 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.320
 this is fast good a lot and he goes too 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.790
 ladies and gentlemen not really broken here 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 This is just another hard drive you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.780
 must have in your game pc 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 if you had a terabyte the ram is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 also green and white perfect in 8 gigabytes 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.299
 two number of the they must be your good for 4 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.740
 gigabyte this 70 euros 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.180
 1609 has that you can overclock to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 1866 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
 because he just eats something very beautiful 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.049
 then the amazon have greatjon 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.110
 online 270 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.430
 then we have the ms hi and then we have the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.149
 ms arion and 972 2 gigabytes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 gddr3 gaming edition this 155 euro 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.909
 he has the twin frozr travel website 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.460
 anyway reliable it is the ocean so it 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.560
 is overclocked or from the factory that is 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 anyway a twin frozr mouse are sitting on it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.090
 So the little clock or you can do yourself 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.770
 and you can do that little over the clock 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.230
 that he gets the same speed as 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.409
 the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.140
 and nine 270 x 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.000
 yes 2 gigabyte gddr5 just has pisa 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 eyed letters 0 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.610
 I 16 has HDMI DVI DVI kitsch yet 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.739
 and it's really just the map 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 this k I just battlefield him 4 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.620
 ceases to play ultra setting with 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.989
 think i wanted 50 to 60 fps through 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 After the power supply while price just 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.650
 another corsair builder 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.269
 this is 430 watts of ice 40 euros he is 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.920
 just really good he is going to time you 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.700
 I think it's going to be more than time you are 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.739
 quite a long time 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 he just went through well after a whole 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.420
 important part of the pilot that is 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.510
 nevertheless the housing the housing 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.859
 have opted for corsair carbide bacon 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.379
 0 2 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.180

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.170
 closet and get so pale boy in love 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.510

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.970
 you can also go with the spec 0 3 that is 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.470
 this one that helps see image 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.239
 who actually looks just who is 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.459
 actually there is exactly the same thing only 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.040
 it just has a more aggressive one 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.690
 outlets in hermine aggressive young dan 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.540
 you can get it if you get this closet 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.310
 buy the two 120mm fans at and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.819
 the can be 7 fans in total and that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.549
 all 120mm fans or able to 5 120mm 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.540
 fans and 240mm fans in one gets up to 200 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.299
 120 mm 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.430
 two hundred and twenty mm fans so yes 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.799

 I've forgotten the names of the names 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.650
 but that might be a bit of a shame 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.410
 but I am not only interested in a DVD drive 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.849

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.620
