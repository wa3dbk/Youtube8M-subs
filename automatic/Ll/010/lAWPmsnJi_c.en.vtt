00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I guess his different bottles of soda

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.059 
I guess his different bottles of soda
pop<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.060> his<00:01:33.390> conical<00:01:34.140> flask<00:01:34.500> away<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:34.950> know

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
pop and his conical flask away you know

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.510 
pop and his conical flask away you know
he<00:01:35.100> takes<00:01:35.940> his<00:01:36.300> his<00:01:37.170> sips<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.649> draught<00:01:38.039> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
he takes his his sips of draught and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
he takes his his sips of draught and
that<00:01:38.700> said<00:01:39.149> it's<00:01:39.270> slightly<00:01:39.420> crazy<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.470> yeah<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that said it's slightly crazy so yeah I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
that said it's slightly crazy so yeah I
think<00:01:41.459> it<00:01:41.640> looks<00:01:41.880> good<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> isn't<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.569> of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
think it looks good so this isn't one of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
think it looks good so this isn't one of
the<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.259> cool<00:01:43.500> characters<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:43.950> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the like like cool characters but this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.550 
the like like cool characters but this
isn't<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.209> series<00:01:45.539> two<00:01:45.720> returning<00:01:46.170> character

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
isn't a series two returning character

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
isn't a series two returning character
but<00:01:46.709> this<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> brand<00:01:47.280> new<00:01:47.580> character<00:01:47.880> for

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
but this is a brand new character for

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
but this is a brand new character for
Skylanders<00:01:48.869> Giants<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.770> let's<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.100> up

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
him so you can see what I was saying

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
him so you can see what I was saying
about<00:01:53.670> pop<00:01:54.000> fizz<00:01:54.179> in<00:01:54.360> terms<00:01:54.539> of<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:55.200> detailing

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
about pop fizz in terms of the detailing

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.790

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
on his mouth and on the back of the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.449 
on his mouth and on the back of the
character<00:01:59.160> is<00:01:59.220> really<00:01:59.490> nice<00:01:59.819> I<00:02:01.220> think<00:02:02.220> this

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
character is really nice I think this

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.650 
character is really nice I think this
probably<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.819> know<00:02:03.030> seems<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.509> more

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
probably you know seems to be more

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.510 
probably you know seems to be more
materials<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> litte<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.590> finesse<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
materials a litte bit more finesse to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.070 
materials a litte bit more finesse to

the painting as twister bob has made
more<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.679> more<00:02:10.800> these<00:02:10.920> characters<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.430> sort

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
more and more these characters they sort

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
more and more these characters they sort
of<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:11.910> better<00:02:12.180> at<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> process<00:02:12.959> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
of have got better at the process of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.199 
of have got better at the process of
sort<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.380> refinement<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.220> it'll<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.030> sting

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
sort of refinement so it'll be in sting

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.370 
sort of refinement so it'll be in sting
not<00:02:15.300> only<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> see<00:02:15.750> these<00:02:15.900> new<00:02:16.140> characters

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
not only to see these new characters

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.339 
not only to see these new characters
both<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.160> how<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.459> series<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.349> release

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
both to see how the series to release

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.680 
both to see how the series to release
characters<00:02:19.770> compared<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.250> their<00:02:20.430> original

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
characters compared to their original

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.240 
characters compared to their original
counterparts<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.349> that's<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> figure<00:02:22.890> also

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
counterparts so that's the figure also

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.360 
counterparts so that's the figure also
in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> box<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:25.380> card<00:02:25.920> similar<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
in the box you have the card similar to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.830 
in the box you have the card similar to
last<00:02:26.459> time<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.849> we<00:02:26.880> have<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.300> pop<00:02:27.630> this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
last time so we have we have pop this

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110 
last time so we have we have pop this
here<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.040> his<00:02:29.220> stats<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.940> his

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
here and you can see his stats so his

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.770 
here and you can see his stats so his
strength<00:02:30.540> his<00:02:31.110> speed<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.769> his<00:02:31.980> attack<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
strength his speed and his attack you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.930 
strength his speed and his attack you
know<00:02:33.870> relatively<00:02:34.230> low<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.650> 50s<00:02:34.769> at<00:02:35.220> 150

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
know relatively low in the 50s at 150

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.610 
know relatively low in the 50s at 150
but<00:02:36.480> where<00:02:36.570> he<00:02:36.690> really<00:02:36.900> seems<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> excel<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.500> in

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
but where he really seems to excel is in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.040 
but where he really seems to excel is in
the<00:02:37.710> luck<00:02:38.090> quotient<00:02:39.090> where<00:02:39.150> he's<00:02:39.300> up<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> 105

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the luck quotient where he's up to 105

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.890 
the luck quotient where he's up to 105
so<00:02:40.440> maybe<00:02:41.010> that's<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.310> signifier<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> how<00:02:42.540> pop

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
so maybe that's a signifier of how pop

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.560 
so maybe that's a signifier of how pop
fizz<00:02:43.230> will<00:02:43.740> play<00:02:44.040> in<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.490> actual<00:02:44.820> game<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.450> of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
maybe like seeing that slowly fill up as

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.130 
maybe like seeing that slowly fill up as
they<00:03:00.060> collect<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.510> different<00:03:00.750> characters

they collect the different characters

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.750 
they collect the different characters
from<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> game<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.100> there<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:02.340> that's<00:03:02.490> pop
