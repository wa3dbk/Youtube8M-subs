00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.909
 rest enough to be well in 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.009
 the day I left loose at the beginning of 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.070
 game and I'm not going to come out that way 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.570
 confident too and for good it is difficult 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.149
 also maintain the level every day 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.750
 thank god in the end he could keep 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.820
 but still the team has to throw 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.610
 to go forward to get the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.039
 lost victories because there is what 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.530

 getting victories over Uruguay and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.500
 jamaica much chance of that

 mexico can advance to the world 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.170
 let's hope this happens but you have to 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.720
