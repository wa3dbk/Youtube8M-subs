00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 at sportsfreunde I'm simon yours 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.420
 muscle maker have you ever heard of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.630
 The effeff belongs to the fat free 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.820
 Muscular mass index a value that expresses 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.769
 whether the performance of the appearance 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 a sportsman nature all possible or 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.699
 not possible 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 This ffm idea is easy too 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 calculate you can do it yourself 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.140
 Based on your body measurements just times 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 make body size body fat percentage and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.490
 the weight is enough so three 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 parameters are already sufficient to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.809
 to express if something natural possible 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.880
 is achievable or if the whole is just 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.380
 only with doping I work show 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 I just want that for you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.290
 still a few words to say that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.420
 Of course it sounds very nice now 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.329
 I can fascinate every athlete 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.219
 now check on these criteria 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.020
 or doping 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.789
 I 'm just doing that now 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 my body data i have one here 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 website found that even offers a fm 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 calculator though the whole thing so banal 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 and easy it is formula is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.750
 really not difficult I link you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 which is also below this video in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.080
 the infobox in there but this website 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.339
 I link for the lazy of you 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.600
 So you can do it again 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.210
 do it yourself 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.920
 My body weight is currently 84 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 kilo i have been there for ten days 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 no longer weighed me 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 Body size unchanged at 175 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 centimeters then unfortunately I could 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 do not change anything 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 my body fat percentage of close at 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.689
 About twelve percent of the job 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.860
 can you see it yourself again ? 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.470
 have a little something lately 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
 posted on facebook whether the whole 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.409
 realistic or not realistic 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 is because you measure the best with something 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 his fatca lipper here one side on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.270
 best also a three-point measurement or 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 but I do appreciate it now 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.119
 just once with twelve percent a 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.579
 and you can say the whole thing 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 realistic or not realistic 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.600
 so i have a result now 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 Get your body weight without fat 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 share is 73 92 kilograms 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.960
 the ffw fat-free mass index is 24.45 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.799
 then underneath is still targeted 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.780
 training allows an ffm worth up 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.970
 25 it is usually only with 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.130
 anabolic 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.410
 that's the way it is here, of course that is 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.260
 ask if it is really that easy 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.540
 that is possible based on a value too 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.670
 tell if someone natural a performance 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.770
 could actually achieve or whether it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 is not possible I tell you so 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 many values, many of these index so for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.520
 example of the bmi are from my 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.770
 far too simple and banal 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.840
 much too one-dimensional and short-sighted 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.250
 Viewing for example this wm 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.470
 is for athletes for strength athletes 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.810
 not at all applicable 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.120
 with this ffm ii the thing already looks 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.370
 quite different from I just think for 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.140
 us bodybuilder it is in the index of the very 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.630
 a climber feels that way 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.180
 someone to as extreme-defined 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 body fat percentage of maybe six 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.870
 percent has just looked like 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.610
 a starving hook for which it is under 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.020
 circumstances then not a thing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.060
 but is applicable for strength athletes 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.030
 can i tell you it is indeed 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.010
 a value that is set somewhere and there 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.110
 there is a very clear dividing line and 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.570
 which is 25 there is a bandage 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.310
 said we also take 26 but it 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.440
 gives a very clear dividing line and me 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.209
 have it neither a mass phase nor in 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.390
 the definition phase in 13 years 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.850
 managed to reach the value of 25 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.900
 or to break the best value 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.700
 I could ever reach 24 86 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.010
 that is a good value for sure too 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.750
 a great form of me but there 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.370
 you always what a span that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.989
 is and I do not believe that me either 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.830
 that someday create this value 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.390
 to break through 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.070
 Of course I think that too 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.690
 surely humans are genetically 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.610
 still have a much better propensity 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.530
 As I genetics is a thing that has 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.720
 you get it or you do not have it 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.180
 but heard on the whole 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.280
 except for people who love Anna 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.840
 so are short for whole 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 thin people who just look like 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.980
 a hunger hook there is of course clear 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.470
 that if now a fmf worth of 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.670
 It would be hard to believe it would reach over 25 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.530
 that to these people at all 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.450
 Muscle mass is just due 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.060
 the fact that the body fat content 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.739
 as low as that is possible for me 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.860
 Ultimately, it's just plain obvious 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.630
 make that this ffm three parameters 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.760
 Of course you can say yes 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.409
 these three parameters 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.819
 can not be everything what is there 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.920
 not playing purely are actual 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.600
 life issues is quite right 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.160
 One may also criticize this defense 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.199
 you can also look at it critically 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.389
 but just for natural bandage it has to 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.740
 just a very clear dividing line 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.570
 give and that was not arbitrary 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.100
 fixed but then you are 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.320
 sports scientists are there too 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.020
 Biologists and doctors agree that it's easy 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.360
 certain limits are therefore our body 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.340
 will not just build muscle 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.560
 purely for the reason that we want it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.300
 but musculature is luxury and this 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.710
 luxury there, the body just only 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.900
 if he also the meaning behind it 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.160
 understands and I think we are there 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.729
 topic which I have treated often enough 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.380
 have 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.750
 that's just my personal 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.039
 Opinion to ffm there can of course 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.510
 everyone else comes and says three 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.050
 parameters are far too short 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.789
 resorted 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.070
 how should it be enough to express 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.930
 if someone natural achieves an achievement 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.100
 has or has not achieved I think that 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.270
 is of course also a opinion that can 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.560
 you accept 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.030
 I would be glad if you all 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.250
 Just comment what you say about it 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.660
 Hold and maybe what ffm 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.639
 niewerth you have there I am 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.470
 curious what it all comes out at 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.479
 See you in the next video does it 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.479
 good greetings your simon
