the guy or whatever but it's not that
way<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.540> think<00:03:16.660> when<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.049> look<00:03:17.320> at<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.739> you

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
way I think when you look at it and you

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.170 
way I think when you look at it and you
take<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.130> back<00:03:18.310> it's<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.670> anybody's<00:03:19.150> fault

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
take it back it's not anybody's fault

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
take it back it's not anybody's fault
you<00:03:19.989> know

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
you know

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.229 
you know
some<00:03:20.530> I'm<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.550> sure<00:03:21.670> what<00:03:21.849> happened<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.150> front

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
some I'm not sure what happened in front

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.210 
some I'm not sure what happened in front
of<00:03:22.390> us<00:03:22.480> 88<00:03:22.900> or<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.110> two<00:03:23.290> spun<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.830> tires<00:03:23.860> I

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
of us 88 or the two spun the tires I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.130 
of us 88 or the two spun the tires I
think<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.819> was<00:03:24.940> I'm<00:03:25.209> not<00:03:25.360> sure<00:03:25.510> who<00:03:25.629> was<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.080> I

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
think it was I'm not sure who was but I

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.530 
think it was I'm not sure who was but I
was<00:03:26.260> just<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.530> know<00:03:27.060> staying<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.209> line<00:03:28.330> doing

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
was just you know staying in line doing

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.970 
was just you know staying in line doing
I<00:03:28.750> could<00:03:28.900> do<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> get<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.860> you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
I could do to get going you know so you

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.440 
I could do to get going you know so you
obviously<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.640> can't<00:03:30.849> pass<00:03:31.030> before<00:03:31.239> the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
obviously you can't pass before the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.080 
obviously you can't pass before the
start/finish<00:03:31.930> line<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.349> I<00:03:32.530> guess<00:03:33.430> Kyle<00:03:33.700> just

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
start/finish line and I guess Kyle just

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.210 
start/finish line and I guess Kyle just
decided<00:03:34.840> he<00:03:34.930> didn't<00:03:35.080> want<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.290> lift<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.739> you

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220
