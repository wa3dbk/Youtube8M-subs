00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi today i would like to introduce a new one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 heading will be a rubric in the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.620
 which will try to recreate me anyway 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 I will be inspired by the outfits of anyway 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 celebrities 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.949
 today we'll talk about melissa satta that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 what he wants to do is not try to imitate 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.640
 her or anything else 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 also because I would feel enough 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 as ridiculous as she really is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.699
 a lot nicer a little while ago I saw one 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 photos on his instagram profile in the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.929
 which matched a pair of trousers 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 floral not the way I maybe not 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.380
 I never would have done 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480
 in the sense that everyone when 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.989
 we think of floral pants we think 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 immediately to play down to combine them with 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.980
 other black garments or otherwise not 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.450
 that looks completely colorful 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 what she did instead is a little bit 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.770
 different we go immediately to see what it does 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 therefore the satta is wearing a pair of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 floral pants that then seeing in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 closer I am not even so much 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.440
 sure that they belong to the master blender 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 real or maybe just not colored 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 I know I could not understand it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.830
 I wear mine that I took from Zara and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 these are on a black background there were 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.680
 also according to white and have these 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.810
 flowers especially let's say board e 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.070
 then turquoise then also result 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.960
 quite difficult as skilled 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 match them if not to a total black 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.970
 obviously it's there if instead you match them to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 a pretty over-sized sweater me 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.509
 I think it was in the period when 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.320
 I tried not to highlight the tummy 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.150
 maybe gray so I put it too 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 this very simple gray sweatshirt with 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 the only peculiarity of these shots 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 it is very very long and very comfortable 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.100
 down instead in the state a t-shirt 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.900
 white too a hands up to white 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 that also appears from under the sweatshirt that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.049
 sum I'm not going to show me how shoes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.180
 the wears a couple of references I think not 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.759
 I'm sure it still felt like 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
 see those high white sneakers 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.060
 instead he didn't have so I chose a 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 pair of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.390
 very simple gray keep twins 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.970
 phonebook find the photo which i 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.340
 I am inspired and also its post 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.860
 on the blog instead if you want to see what I have 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.860
 combined I leave you the action photos 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.050
 by movements 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.580
 that being said, that's all 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.890
 if you have other nice ones by 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.349

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.099
