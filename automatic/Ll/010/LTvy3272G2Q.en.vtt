00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.890
 i 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.569
 hello how are you welcome to another video 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.900
 today following the trend of 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.360
 the metallized looks not feel 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.639
 what we told you in previous videos 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.619
 let's do something with gold but more 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.419
 smooth that the video with silver that I made 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.789
 previously so that they have another 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.739
 alternative already the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.329
 do now I'm with nothing on my face 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.939
 so I'm going to start from scratch first 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.599
 I will apply the concealer view 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.599
 bobby braun 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.510
 he highlighted a little 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.550
 as a base I will use the last one the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 launch of lancÃ´me that I loved 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.670
 that's called james and double ultra I do not know 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.220
 exactly how the second one is said 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 but why word tells them is the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.370
 I say this as it is written and the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.760
 color that I'm going to apply and do the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.710
 0-3 with the 190 brand brush 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 it seems very 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 easily and has a termination that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.850
 It is bright but ideal for people 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.979
 who have mixed skin this has to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.799
 it looks very natural almost as if one does not 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.200
 had base since that is the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 objective as translucent powder I'm going to 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.509
 use the high definition powder of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.570
 make up forever and I'm going to apply them in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.740
 this case with this Japanese plant 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 he said with 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.030
 I want this part to stay more 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.670
 bright and I have drier skin and 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.980
 so I'm not going to apply step now to 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.350
 the eyes I will use the shadow of mac 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.520
 wood weekend and I'm going to apply it with the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.550
 pixel of shadows 239 I go to the eyelid 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.550
 mobile 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.000
 with this mix the special to delineate 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.890
 Japanese I'm going to do is a delineated 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.530
 gluing the lashes down with the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.960
 same shadow that fades 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.020
 towards the lacrimal to delineate I'll 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.660
 use the branded icon teddy since 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.170
 it's also in a bronze tone more 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.230
 metallized already and I'm going to apply up 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.170
 pegadito to the eyelashes and a little bit 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.750
 inside and on the lower eyelid also 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 inside although this makeup I'm going to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.920
 put my mouth harder and I'm going to 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.600
 give a little touch a little more 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 based on the eyes for which they 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.350
 like a little more marked that I'm going to 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 do it by marking the depth a bit 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.300
 with this beautiful shadow of sant laurent 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.380
 which is an individual shadow and in the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.330
 number 18 a tone like dark eggplant 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 just here a little touch 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.410
 and blurred with the 22 12 max I'm also going 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.570
 to take advantage of delineating me down on the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.820
 corner with the same tone to give it a 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.980
 little bit more heat in the eyelashes I'm going 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.520
 to use the bold in million lasers of 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.520
 L'Oreal Paris 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.920
 and I'm going to put a small drop in the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.530
 down on the lips I'm going to use this 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.709
 lovely two threads of white 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.120
 which is what we talked about very recently 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.910
 in the blog so you can look for more 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.830
 the information there are 24 colors so that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.959
 can choose and I loved it so 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.250
 I want to show you in this case I'm 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.250
 using the 379 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.530
 and now I'm going to define more with the brush 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.390
 as a final touch I will use the 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.260
 mineral ice black of mac in color 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.450
 blue gray in which is more subtle than 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.280
 has one as its name says 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.560
 It has a very special luminosity and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.170
 I am also using the brush of 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.120
 Japanese blush that I hope you have 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.950
 liked this video as you have seen 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.200
 lately I 'm playing it a little 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.560
 more for putting more color in your mouth like this 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.970
 I hope you like these new 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.310
 modifications that we have made for 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.720
 look more looks of this native that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.720
 go very well and see you in another video
