00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.519

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.990
 lately very thin 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.409
 I do not know if it's being thrown at me 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.409
 here 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.689
 well then that too 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.689
 we'll see 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.969
 installing the screen today only friends 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.969
 of pixel 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.979
 not all white then now it seems 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.780
 lamborghini aventador fanned good the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.259
 thing I have to get there first you know 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.030
 the others extracted from congratulating the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.009
 same career they defeated that we did 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.899
 gloves but now it is a car more 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.000
 highest I have to defeat is the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.430
 third or fourth I think it 's the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 third that I think is not safe with gatti 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.440
 veyron sport and well what I see 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.850
 this advanced it I ask the front is 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.310
 Of course, the advance did not catch me 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.690
 more than I 'm not touching all with everything 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.190
 what I catch 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.780
 so we're going to see that the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.290
 wind 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.600
 no liquids 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.380
 first that I will not care first and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.380

 I know exactly what to climb you know 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.270
 the screen I hope it 's my 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.270
 screen and then it's not pixelated 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 on the roof that is like lifting all the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800
 car paint milks 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.370

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.790
 with delivery where I'm good at it 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.560
 you will notice but playing with the keyboard does not 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.469
 mine that sometimes I'm leaving with the command 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.750
 the call of duty is worth it and it was first 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.810

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.640
 that is not capable 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.640

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.170

 English a car whose car I do not know 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.479
 I do not have much agility for what 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.880

 my side 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.520
 let's see let's give a little 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.449
 back and see if the car comes towards 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.449

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.229
 when it escapes you 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.000
 then it passes by your side it advances you 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:10.460
 been failed and after knocking it down 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.460
 again a second chance 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.500
