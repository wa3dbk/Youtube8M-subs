to knit the next 4 stitches off of our
main<00:02:04.090> needle

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.010 

then<00:02:15.130> we'll<00:02:15.340> knit<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.940> four<00:02:16.180> stitches<00:02:16.420> off<00:02:16.780> of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
then we'll knit the four stitches off of

then we'll knit the four stitches off of
our<00:02:17.170> cable<00:02:17.560> needle

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.990 

now<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.390> creates<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.840> cable<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.410> sweeps

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
now this creates a cable that sweeps

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.240 
now this creates a cable that sweeps
going<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.290> wanted<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.710> cable<00:02:42.070> that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
going right if you wanted a cable that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.970 
going right if you wanted a cable that
goes<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.730> other<00:02:42.760> direction<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.830> have<00:02:44.920> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
goes the other direction we just have to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.490 
goes the other direction we just have to
make<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.160> simple<00:02:45.970> change<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.170> instead<00:02:53.440> of

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
make one simple change so instead of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.100 
make one simple change so instead of
doing<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.890> cable<00:02:54.370> eight<00:02:55.060> back<00:02:55.720> we'll<00:02:55.990> do<00:02:56.080> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
doing a cable eight back we'll do a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.320 
doing a cable eight back we'll do a
cable<00:02:56.410> eight<00:02:56.770> front<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.640> we'll<00:02:57.760> slip<00:02:58.060> those

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
cable eight front so we'll slip those

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.950 
cable eight front so we'll slip those
four<00:02:58.600> stitches<00:02:58.870> off<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:06.060> hold<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.390> cable

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
four stitches off and hold the cable

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.050 
four stitches off and hold the cable
needle<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:08.380> front<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:09.160> we'll<00:03:09.400> knit<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.850> four

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
needle in front then we'll knit the four

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
needle in front then we'll knit the four
stitches<00:03:10.300> from<00:03:10.810> our<00:03:11.110> main<00:03:11.590> needle

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.290 

and<00:03:19.170> then<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.160> four<00:03:20.370> stitches<00:03:20.790> from<00:03:21.060> our
