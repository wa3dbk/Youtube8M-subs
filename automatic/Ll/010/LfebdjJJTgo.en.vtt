cheap<00:00:16.199> induction<00:00:16.770> rollers<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.940> first<00:00:18.180> step

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
cheap induction rollers the first step

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
cheap induction rollers the first step
is<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> take<00:00:19.020> our<00:00:19.170> index<00:00:19.320> fingers<00:00:19.740> point<00:00:20.340> them

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
is to take our index fingers point them

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.460 
is to take our index fingers point them
up<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> second<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.289> bolts

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
up and then use the second that bolts

up and then use the second that bolts
from<00:00:22.529> your<00:00:22.680> second<00:00:22.920> fingers<00:00:23.160> lock<00:00:23.970> them

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
from your second fingers lock them

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.650 
from your second fingers lock them
together<00:00:24.769> point<00:00:25.769> them<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.070> hair<00:00:26.220> length

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660

and separate raids at perfect we use a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.240 
and separate raids at perfect we use a
cheat<00:00:35.610> clip<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.210> section<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> off<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.950> while

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
take a subsection get a comb right

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.450 
take a subsection get a comb right
through<00:01:55.020> notice<00:01:56.020> if<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.229> roller<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.830> not<00:01:57.220> hot

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
through notice if the roller is not hot

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.639 
through notice if the roller is not hot
the<00:01:57.850> heat<00:01:58.060> will<00:01:58.360> start<00:01:58.390> as<00:01:58.869> we<00:01:59.080> start<00:01:59.289> rolling

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
the heat will start as we start rolling

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.529 
the heat will start as we start rolling
the<00:01:59.860> hair<00:02:00.039> now<00:02:01.030> we're<00:02:01.149> going<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.330> continue

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
the hair now we're going to continue

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.270 
the hair now we're going to continue
doing<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> same<00:02:01.990> thing<00:02:02.440> all<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:02.979> back

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
doing the same thing all the way back

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.309 
doing the same thing all the way back
keeping<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.179> mind<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.810> longer<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.289> hair

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
keeping in mind that the longer the hair

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.320 
keeping in mind that the longer the hair
the<00:02:05.890> more<00:02:06.039> curl<00:02:06.369> we'll<00:02:06.520> get<00:02:06.729> with<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.060> smaller

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
the more curl we'll get with the smaller

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.630 
the more curl we'll get with the smaller
rollers<00:02:07.690> so<00:02:08.200> we<00:02:08.350> can<00:02:08.649> use<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.160> larger<00:02:09.489> rows

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
rollers so we can use the larger rows
