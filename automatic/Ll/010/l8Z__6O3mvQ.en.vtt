nice rubber it's a really good quality

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
nice rubber it's a really good quality
and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.830> feel<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.100> Corsairs<00:00:59.700> really<00:01:00.240> nailed

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and I feel like Corsairs really nailed

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.170 
and I feel like Corsairs really nailed
it<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.810> terms<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.800> material<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.940> also

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it in terms of this material it's also

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
it in terms of this material it's also
incredibly<00:01:03.420> non-slip<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> easy<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> pick<00:01:05.850> up

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
incredibly non-slip and easy to pick up

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.820 
incredibly non-slip and easy to pick up
so<00:01:06.660> there's<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.050> be<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.350> problems

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so there's not going to be any problems

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
so there's not going to be any problems
there<00:01:08.570> although<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:10.080> problem<00:01:10.410> that<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.680> often

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
there although one problem that I often

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.580 
there although one problem that I often
see<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.790> cliff<00:01:12.030> mouse<00:01:12.270> mats<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.290> they

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
see with cliff mouse mats is that they

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.040 
see with cliff mouse mats is that they
fray<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.640> rubber<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.570> cloth<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> top

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
fray the rubber and the cloth on top

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.640 
fray the rubber and the cloth on top
often<00:01:16.950> starts<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> pull<00:01:17.610> apart<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> fray<00:01:18.930> now

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
often starts to pull apart and fray now

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
often starts to pull apart and fray now
that<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> pretty<00:01:20.310> big<00:01:20.580> issue<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.970> cloth

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that is a pretty big issue with cloth

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.900 
that is a pretty big issue with cloth
mouse<00:01:21.600> mats<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> Corsair<00:01:23.100> has<00:01:23.130> really

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
mouse mats so a Corsair has really

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.520 
mouse mats so a Corsair has really
seemed<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> nail<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.690> quality<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.260> mouse

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410 
seemed to nail the quality of this mouse
mat<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.790> foresee<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
mat and I don't really foresee that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.719 
mat and I don't really foresee that
happening<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.290> mouse<00:01:28.590> mat<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
but let's be honest here the main reason

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.120 
but let's be honest here the main reason
why<00:01:35.759> anyone<00:01:36.390> buys<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:36.930> extended<00:01:37.470> mouse<00:01:37.649> mat<00:01:37.950> is

off their keyboard in their mouth and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.540 
off their keyboard in their mouth and
often<00:01:42.690> with<00:01:42.780> his<00:01:42.930> extended<00:01:43.350> mouse<00:01:43.619> mats<00:01:43.920> they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
decorations all over it it really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.820 
decorations all over it it really
detracts<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.810> real<00:01:52.140> reason<00:01:52.619> why<00:01:52.770> you
