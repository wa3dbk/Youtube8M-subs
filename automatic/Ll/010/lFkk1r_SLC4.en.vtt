00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
running their body temperature goes from

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.590 
running their body temperature goes from
10<00:00:55.600> 12<00:00:56.020> like<00:00:56.290> 103<00:00:57.130> 104<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:58.030> all<00:00:58.239> we're<00:00:58.450> trying

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
right here see how much heat is coming

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630 
right here see how much heat is coming
out<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.900> it<00:01:14.080> right<00:01:14.229> now<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.220> wind<00:01:15.430> jacket

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
out of it right now so the wind jacket

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.430 
out of it right now so the wind jacket
is<00:01:15.850> keeping<00:01:16.330> some<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.810> heat<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.350> then

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
is keeping some of that heat in and then

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.320 
is keeping some of that heat in and then
we<00:01:17.560> have<00:01:17.650> this<00:01:17.740> fleece<00:01:18.040> jacket<00:01:18.520> that's<00:01:18.880> key<00:01:19.210> to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
we have this fleece jacket that's key to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.320 
we have this fleece jacket that's key to
keeping<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.750> lot<00:01:19.870> more<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.440> um<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.030> that's

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
keeping a lot more of it in um so that's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570 
keeping a lot more of it in um so that's
because<00:01:22.810> it's<00:01:23.409> supposed<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.890> be<00:01:24.010> like<00:01:24.190> 40

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
because it's supposed to be like 40

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.230 
because it's supposed to be like 40
below<00:01:24.670> on<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.540> river<00:01:25.720> um<00:01:26.409> so<00:01:27.130> he's<00:01:27.970> looking

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
below on the river um so he's looking

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.360 
below on the river um so he's looking
pretty<00:01:28.270> good<00:01:28.710> he'll<00:01:29.710> be<00:01:29.860> hitting<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.130> wind

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
pretty good he'll be hitting the wind

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.190 
pretty good he'll be hitting the wind
right<00:01:30.610> here<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.540> see<00:01:31.690> that's<00:01:31.869> why<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.020> guess

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
right here so you see that's why I guess

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.289 
right here so you see that's why I guess
is<00:01:32.320> t-shirt<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.130> if<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> wind<00:01:33.880> comes<00:01:33.970> from

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
is t-shirt on and if the wind comes from

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.760 
is t-shirt on and if the wind comes from
the<00:01:34.390> side<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:35.080> see<00:01:35.110> is<00:01:35.320> pretty<00:01:35.619> well

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the side you can see is pretty well

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.430 
the side you can see is pretty well
protected<00:01:35.920> here<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.750> want<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.020> see<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.200> dog

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
protected here so you want to see a dog

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.260 
protected here so you want to see a dog
that<00:01:38.619> doesn't<00:01:38.860> have<00:01:39.430> his<00:01:39.549> head<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:40.000> coat

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270

so<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.689> he<00:01:46.719> here<00:01:47.170> she's<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.860> lot<00:01:48.070> thicker<00:01:48.310> coat

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
so is he here she's a lot thicker coat

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.980 
so is he here she's a lot thicker coat
ten<00:01:49.329> raimundos<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:51.850> her<00:01:52.149> she's<00:01:52.810> all

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
ten raimundos you can see her she's all

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.980 
ten raimundos you can see her she's all
hairy<00:01:53.289> in<00:01:53.590> here<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:55.180> all<00:01:55.420> she's<00:01:55.750> got<00:01:55.930> is

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
hairy in here and so all she's got is

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.230 
hairy in here and so all she's got is
just<00:01:56.289> windbreaker<00:01:56.710> I'm<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:57.939> see<00:01:58.090> she

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
just windbreaker I'm you can see she

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.240 
just windbreaker I'm you can see she
doesn't<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.630> any<00:01:58.810> heat<00:01:59.049> escaping<00:01:59.649> from<00:02:00.009> her

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
doesn't have any heat escaping from her

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.219 
doesn't have any heat escaping from her
body<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.640> Waylon<00:02:01.060> did<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:01.719> what<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.170> is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
