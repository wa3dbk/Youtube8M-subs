don't like is how simple it is to make

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
don't like is how simple it is to make
now<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> our<00:00:48.899> very<00:00:49.260> early<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> mods

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
now this is our very early in the mods

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
now this is our very early in the mods
development<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.879> i'm<00:00:50.969> sure<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.420> become

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
development so i'm sure it will become

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740 
development so i'm sure it will become
more<00:00:52.530> complex<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> goes<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.329> i'm<00:00:54.539> at

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
more complex as it goes on but i'm at

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.119 
more complex as it goes on but i'm at
the<00:00:54.870> moment<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> make<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the moment to make it you just need a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
the moment to make it you just need a
boat<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.789> wooden<00:00:57.120> planks<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.379> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
boat of wooden planks with the one on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830 
boat of wooden planks with the one on
top<00:00:58.710> against<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> represents<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> rotor

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
top against that represents the rotor

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
top against that represents the rotor
assembly<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> i'll<00:01:02.129> make<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.399> day<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:02.850> but

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
assembly of it i'll make it day here but

the graphics of this as you can see
there's<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> holographic<00:01:20.430> display<00:01:20.970> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
there's like a holographic display you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
there's like a holographic display you
know<00:01:21.810> has<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.170> has<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.770> texture<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
know has it has very good texture for it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
know has it has very good texture for it
and<00:01:23.960> one<00:01:24.960> cool<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
it by right-clicking you can actually
see<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.619> rotor<00:01:28.860> start<00:01:29.520> spinning<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
see the rotor start spinning and the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.920 
see the rotor start spinning and the
tail<00:01:30.960> rotor<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> spinning<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.869> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
tail rotor to is spinning so that's your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
tail rotor to is spinning so that's your
little<00:01:34.110> helicopter<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.700> control<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
little helicopter here to control it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.050 
little helicopter here to control it
it's<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.720> too<00:01:36.900> complex<00:01:37.320> space<00:01:38.100> bar<00:01:38.340> oh<00:01:38.549> that's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it's not too complex space bar oh that's

you'll grant him to hold down space to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.590 
you'll grant him to hold down space to
ascend<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.770> hit<00:02:02.009> left<00:02:02.600> left

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
ascend with that you can hit left left

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
ascend with that you can hit left left
and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:03.990> right<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and then right you can go back and you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.399 
and then right you can go back and you
need<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> hit<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.750> need<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.079> holding<00:02:07.320> down

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
need a hit you need to be holding down

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.529 
need a hit you need to be holding down
space<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.039> power<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
space to actually power so it is a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
space to actually power so it is a
pretty<00:02:10.020> similar<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> driving<00:02:10.739> an<00:02:10.890> actor

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pretty similar to driving an actor

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.720 
pretty similar to driving an actor
helicopter<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> third<00:02:12.000> person<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730

this<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.180> what<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.360> kind<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.599> look<00:02:13.720> like<00:02:13.750> as

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
this is what you kind of look like as

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.039 
this is what you kind of look like as
you<00:02:14.080> sweep<00:02:14.260> around<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:14.590> world<00:02:14.860> um<00:02:16.049> I'll

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
you sweep around your world um I'll

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.690 
you sweep around your world um I'll
quickly<00:02:17.319> uh<00:02:17.470> see<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.430> demonstrate

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
quickly uh see if I can demonstrate

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000 
quickly uh see if I can demonstrate
damage<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:19.659> this<00:02:20.019> thing<00:02:20.230> isn't<00:02:20.560> invincible

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
damage now this thing isn't invincible

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.430 
damage now this thing isn't invincible
you'll<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:21.849> damage<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.690> relatively

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you'll take damage and it is relatively

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.190 
you'll take damage and it is relatively
a<00:02:24.000> relatively<00:02:25.000> easy<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.480> take<00:02:25.629> damage<00:02:25.870> it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
a relatively easy to take damage it's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.160 
a relatively easy to take damage it's
very<00:02:26.379> fragile<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.069> um<00:02:27.780> quickly<00:02:28.780> see<00:02:28.989> if<00:02:29.019> I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
very fragile so um quickly see if I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.339 
very fragile so um quickly see if I
can't<00:02:29.440> drop<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> ground<00:02:30.840> okay<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.230> they

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
can't drop to the ground okay and they

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.600 
can't drop to the ground okay and they
can't<00:02:32.560> drop<00:02:32.709> work<00:02:32.920> enough<00:02:33.129> let's<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.489> see<00:02:33.580> if

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
can't drop work enough let's just see if

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.400 
can't drop work enough let's just see if
I<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.819> hit<00:02:33.910> something<00:02:34.239> oh<00:02:35.400> jeez<00:02:37.110> trees<00:02:38.110> trees

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
I can hit something oh jeez trees trees

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.890 
I can hit something oh jeez trees trees
are<00:02:38.620> good<00:02:40.019> yeah<00:02:41.129> yeah<00:02:42.299> alright<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.629> as<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
are good yeah yeah alright and as you

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.360 
are good yeah yeah alright and as you
can<00:02:43.989> see<00:02:44.019> by<00:02:44.319> hitting<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.769> took<00:02:44.920> thirty

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
can see by hitting that I took thirty

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.059 
can see by hitting that I took thirty
two<00:02:45.790> percent<00:02:46.060> damage<00:02:46.599> now<00:02:47.500> when<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.799> reach<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
two percent damage now when you reach a
