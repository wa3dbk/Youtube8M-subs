00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
toothpick and tweezers which if I'm

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.870 
toothpick and tweezers which if I'm
correct<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.330> buy<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> 4-pack<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.280> both<00:03:22.280> for

correct you can buy a 4-pack of both for
a<00:03:23.360> dollar<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:24.170> someone<00:03:24.620> on<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.430> site<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.970> it's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
a dollar or someone on the site and it's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.780 
a dollar or someone on the site and it's
really<00:03:26.390> nice<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.100> different<00:03:28.580> from<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
really nice this is different from the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.790 
really nice this is different from the
fisherman<00:03:29.330> because<00:03:29.630> instead<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.530> pliers

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
fisherman because instead of the pliers

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.110 
fisherman because instead of the pliers
the<00:03:31.160> fisherman<00:03:31.670> has<00:03:31.850> scissors<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:33.650> believe

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the fisherman has scissors and I believe

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120 
the fisherman has scissors and I believe
the<00:03:35.120> fisherman<00:03:35.510> also<00:03:35.780> has<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:35.989> hook<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the fisherman also has a hook on the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.949 
the fisherman also has a hook on the
bottom<00:03:37.370> right<00:03:37.640> over<00:03:37.790> here<00:03:38.000> but<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.239> comes<00:03:38.720> with

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
bottom right over here but it comes with

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.150 
bottom right over here but it comes with
this<00:03:39.110> nice<00:03:39.410> little<00:03:40.120> fish<00:03:41.120> Louisville<00:03:41.540> on<00:03:41.930> it

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
this nice little fish Louisville on it

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.360 
this nice little fish Louisville on it
um<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.580> think<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.500> skills<00:03:45.500> are<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.070> little<00:03:46.220> bit

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
um I think the skills are a little bit

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.750 
um I think the skills are a little bit
darker<00:03:46.730> than<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.600> other<00:03:47.780> ones<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.610> I'm<00:03:49.610> not

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
darker than the other ones and I'm not

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.070 
darker than the other ones and I'm not
sure<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.150> haven't<00:03:50.390> seen<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> lot<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.900> them

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
sure that I haven't seen a lot of them

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.820 
sure that I haven't seen a lot of them
but<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:53.000> know<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:53.690> nice<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.200> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
but you know it's a really nice one the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.850 
but you know it's a really nice one the
only<00:03:55.070> problem<00:03:55.700> with<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:56.540> as<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.350> said<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.590> think

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
only problem with it as I said I think

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.320
