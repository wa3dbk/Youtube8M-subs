00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
the safest and most effective and to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.810 
the safest and most effective and to
removal<00:00:51.870> both<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.590> terms<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.010> results<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.150 

and<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.879> answer<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.239> we<00:01:01.660> use<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.440> principle

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
and the answer is we use a principle

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.230 
and the answer is we use a principle
called<00:01:03.479> selective<00:01:04.479> photo<00:01:05.610> thermolysis<00:01:06.610> which

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
called selective photo thermolysis which

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.590 
called selective photo thermolysis which
is<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:08.080> fancy<00:01:08.290> medical<00:01:08.770> term<00:01:09.310> for<00:01:09.640> taking

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
is just a fancy medical term for taking

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.450 
is just a fancy medical term for taking
energy<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> form<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.710> laser<00:01:12.009> light

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
energy in the form of laser light

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.180 
energy in the form of laser light
sending<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.509> through<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.590> layers<00:01:14.799> of<00:01:15.009> the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
sending it through the layers of the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.940 
sending it through the layers of the
skin<00:01:15.549> without<00:01:15.729> burning<00:01:16.479> those<00:01:17.290> layers<00:01:17.649> of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
skin without burning those layers of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.609 
skin without burning those layers of

your<00:01:22.810> tattoo<00:01:23.259> lives<00:01:23.590> be<00:01:24.310> absorbed<00:01:24.909> by<00:01:25.180> your

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
your tattoo lives be absorbed by your

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.510 
your tattoo lives be absorbed by your
ink<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.869> then<00:01:26.229> be<00:01:26.409> broken<00:01:26.860> down<00:01:26.890> into<00:01:27.250> little

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
ink and then be broken down into little

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.850 
ink and then be broken down into little
teeny<00:01:27.850> weeny<00:01:28.149> pieces<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:29.140> your<00:01:29.350> body<00:01:29.530> can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
teeny weeny pieces that your body can

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.400 
teeny weeny pieces that your body can
then<00:01:30.070> no<00:01:30.520> break<00:01:30.759> apart<00:01:31.090> mobilized<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
then no break apart mobilized and the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.609 
then no break apart mobilized and the
trick<00:01:32.679> here<00:01:33.009> is<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.789> use<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.240> right<00:01:34.869> laser<00:01:35.170> and

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
trick here is to use the right laser and

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.010 
trick here is to use the right laser and
the<00:01:36.009> right<00:01:36.310> wavelength<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.479> right<00:01:37.690> spot

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the right wavelength and the right spot

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.109 
the right wavelength and the right spot
size<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.679> right<00:01:38.860> frequency<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
size and the right frequency and the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.960 
size and the right frequency and the
right<00:01:40.390> energy<00:01:40.660> so<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.800> laser<00:01:42.130> gets

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
right energy so that the laser gets

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.899 
right energy so that the laser gets
absorbed<00:01:43.470> only<00:01:44.470> by<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> particular<00:01:45.250> colors

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
absorbed only by the particular colors

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.510 
absorbed only by the particular colors
of<00:01:46.210> ink<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.840> wanted<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.649> not<00:01:47.710> by<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
of ink that you wanted to and not by the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.600 
of ink that you wanted to and not by the
normal<00:01:49.440> components<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:50.560> your<00:01:50.590> skin<00:01:51.190> and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
normal components of your skin and

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.180 
normal components of your skin and
thereby<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.149> eliminate<00:01:52.899> collateral<00:01:53.800> damage

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
thereby you eliminate collateral damage

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.859 
thereby you eliminate collateral damage
and<00:01:54.399> scarring<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.179> all<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.360> other<00:01:55.600> problems

that can occur so in order to do this
