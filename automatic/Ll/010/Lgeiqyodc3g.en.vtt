00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.130
 Welcome to Alpha Centauri 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.130
 do you know the homogeneity of the room 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.519
 There are a few of the really important laws of nature 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.049
 There's mobility about time 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.960
 so the time to be me 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.079
 Aloe life 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.710
 choppy pieces is there but that always looks like powerful flows when 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.199
 she flows 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.609
 and there is the homogeneity of space which guarantees the mobility of time 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.310
 Energy conservation with a calf 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.779
 I can in the time before to run backwards then would have to 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.570
 process 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.140
 if none of them did not just go down as well as completely back 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.130
 We all know that it does not work so one person and run 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.860
 posed 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 and these are broken and that does not bring up by all alone again 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.910
 on the table and sits down together 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.820
 but, in principle, in an ideal world, the homogeneity of time would be the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 Energy conservation is guaranteed 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.690
 past back «Götz until evenly 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.330
 and always right 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.650
 the mobility of space guarantees impulse conservation 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.370
 the momentum is not a number like the temperature of every bit 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100
 warmer the bit colder and so on 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.380
 his impulses his dishes of greatness 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.090
 the impulse is the product of mass sore 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.260
 speed 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.010
 the speed is a directional quantity 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.180
 So that's a so-called path 2a. Dr Impuls is therefore a directional one 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.230
 larger 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.080
 if the homogeneity of the room is fulfilled then it does not matter what happens then 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.470
 the momentum in the system must be maintained 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.620
 that is, in other words, if from a rocket behind what was called out 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 Maseret of fuel narrow speed so push off then the must 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 Rocket mass of the rocket times the speed of the rocket 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 facilities 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.350
 the thought of the old opera so if that is the case, then the moon must ran 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.410
 and we are already in the middle of problems 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.600
 we come here way 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 our 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.459
 the proviso that those who have to receive the impulse so here's way »means 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:53.689
 Options in the Earth's way 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.170
 how can you travel in space 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 bridge big really long distances 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.049
 where, after all, I am always under these natural laws 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.270
 have often skipped over it what's up and what's not and wants today 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.710
 I tell him my story 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.669
 from a method the Tate 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 which violates such important laws of nature and with which we may 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:12.980
 actually someday 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.899
 but to the stars can be called 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.989
 you have to spend a lot of energy 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.149
 it's about light 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.399
 it's about 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.259
 Sailing can 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.119
 with the help of light 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.119
 how can you sail on light 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.529
 so light 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.159
 is a 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.930
 very special juice 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.849
 Fettich brought something 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.139
 Of course, everything is not 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.539
 Light is not a factual matter 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.509
 but not 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.109
 not that energy 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.610
 Light a wave 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.829
 and paint particles 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.869
 the couple was everything at the moment I that they need what we need right now is that 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.989
 when light hits matter there is a pressure 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.429
 and this pressure the chambers associations around, for example, a spaceship 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.069
 within the solar system 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.749
 Massa was 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.230
 Let's do it from the beginning so we want to fly mobile we have to 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.379
 So reach certain speed and there are whole works with help 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.590
 of the Impulse Althaus as the child has to get it out with it 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.499
 continues 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.999
 and certainly you do not need anything to be repelled of 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:27.540
 There are always questions like that 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.290
 before that, Dan Diker missiles launch into space 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.959
 no matter no matter no matter in fact there is none as good as none 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.500
 Pilots who are, however, the cargo space is relatively relatively lower so divide Bobic 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.139
 centimeter 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.249
 the water is not the way it is customary 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.939
 Speed ​​in one direction yes wide fabric out of the device 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.299
 then the rocket moves 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.139
 in the other direction and say you think for example you could yes 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:49.929
 perhaps 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:54.069
 he with particularly intense light so mission garden so-called reader Mr 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.639
 are very very intense you could not harm 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.659
 For example, you save energy on board a rocket 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.619
 Smash him out with Arno, a reactor had to go to some 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.290
 Ignite fuels such as material to produce antimatter 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.300
 To exclude three offenders, you can 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.290
 With the help of this reader beam the energy you need on board 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.970
 practically from Earth to bring the spaceship and there you could 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.250
 then cause the corresponding detonations for example that would be in 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.770
 In a sense, the energy is transferred via drag with the help of light into a spaceship 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.120
 on 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.389
 Percent that of course is difficult 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.300
 What should it shine for patterns exactly 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.330
 in the rocket are landed values ​​in water shortage 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.210
 Alba must come exactly where the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.600
 where then in the rocket, in fact, the light is also used to 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 example 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.520
 Percent and fusion reactor nuclear fusion thread or matter 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.400
 Antimatter to 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.659
 that's almost impossible 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.780
 because this ray of light 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.850
 He goes on and on and on but you want as much as possible 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.350
 Intensity in the rocket have it so forgot that is already me to that 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.550
 works Bauer 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.439
 but maybe that works 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.719
 radiate a very different use of laser because the reader beam the modem 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.599
 So he prefers to be seen in front of me 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.469
 Above all, Chelsea's smells radiantly intense in the beam of light that has 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.930
 a very clear direction 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.950
 yes, yes 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.920
 Still important to Nina are always ahead 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.730
 So the case then really from the earth, for example to the spaceship and if s 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.320
 On this spaceship a big light sees the culprit so an aluminum 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.710
 Coal for example a big one 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.939
 then year would 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.089
 a reflective aluminum foil there is a very interesting effect 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.089
 the light hits this aluminum foil 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.479
 accelerates these slides 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.259
 is reflected by the then again and transmits to this 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.030
 Way now that the insanely imposing that he is still 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.340
 the double of the impulse of this white shines that of course great 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.360
 Sven has fantastic machine as can imagine where runs will have 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:56.139
 the interrogated 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.790
 Imagine they wanted to beam an intense reader 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.479
 use a spaceship to accelerate 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.819
 that means of course 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:06.240
 forced 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.440
 because the spaceship big so all the lights need to go anywhere then today 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.249
 they put a lot of pressure 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.590
 must be brought to this important so that the light sails in turn 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.539
 how we take the spaceship, so to speak 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.180
 an enormous pressure "means an enormous intensity and they get this 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.800
 Universe does not give anything if you want to travel in space 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.110
 then they either have to 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.000
 but collect such things that do not work in fuel because they 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.779
 at least one medium too much 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.699
 little material gives approx 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.409
 Bremermann harmless only make it over when they knew it with me 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.610
 start laughing because 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.710
 the concepts of the attic so insane do I have to do away now moments are included 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.409
 light 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.280
 So Ungermann sends that to you 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.430
 b Drive with the help of light and push the spaceship 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.479
 slowly 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:51.539
 on velvet deck 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.369
 but the problem is, of course, that of course, the spaceship cook 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:58.099
 one in standards pressure and you can do so right now and then you get 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.240
 For example, out if you want to actually accelerate something percent 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.340
 then you need for months the total energy needs of the earth 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.529
 currently just has concentrated in which city 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.039
 that will probably never happen at international conferences 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.759
 enforcing his had to do something completely different
