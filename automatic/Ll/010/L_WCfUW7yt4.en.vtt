00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
thought there wouldn't be heavily in the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.830 
thought there wouldn't be heavily in the
trap<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.820> then<00:04:45.210> he<00:04:45.330> thought<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.690> there

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
trap and then he thought that there

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.920 
trap and then he thought that there
would<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:47.070> as<00:04:47.220> he<00:04:47.310> got<00:04:47.460> nearer<00:04:47.820> he<00:04:48.390> was<00:04:48.600> sure

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
would and as he got nearer he was sure

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.110 
would and as he got nearer he was sure
that<00:04:48.960> there<00:04:49.440> would<00:04:49.620> because<00:04:50.610> he<00:04:50.700> could<00:04:50.880> hear

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
that there would because he could hear

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.630 
that there would because he could hear
it<00:04:51.270> heifer<00:04:51.600> lambing<00:04:52.050> about<00:04:52.290> like<00:04:52.530> anything

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.030 

and<00:04:56.640> he<00:04:56.760> wanted<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.120> run<00:04:57.270> away<00:04:57.419> but<00:04:58.040> somehow

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
and he wanted to run away but somehow

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.730 
and he wanted to run away but somehow
having<00:04:59.460> got<00:04:59.640> so<00:05:00.030> near<00:05:00.419> he<00:05:01.110> felt<00:05:01.350> that<00:05:01.410> he<00:05:01.560> must

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
having got so near he felt that he must

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.120 
having got so near he felt that he must
just<00:05:02.220> see<00:05:02.610> what<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> Heffalump<00:05:03.360> was<00:05:03.690> like<00:05:03.980> so<00:05:04.980> he
