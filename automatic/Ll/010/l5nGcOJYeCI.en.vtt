00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:57.479 
have one
give<00:05:52.399> me<00:05:52.489> all<00:05:52.580> right<00:05:52.789> all<00:05:53.349> right<00:05:54.349> all<00:05:55.339> right

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:57.489 
give me all right all right all right

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:00.159 
give me all right all right all right
let's<00:05:58.489> do<00:05:58.580> know<00:05:58.759> about<00:05:58.849> the<00:05:58.999> first<00:05:59.149> time<00:05:59.330> we

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
let's do know about the first time we

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.059 
let's do know about the first time we
can<00:06:00.319> go<00:06:00.439> hands<00:06:00.889> to<00:06:01.879> listen<00:06:02.149> and<00:06:02.239> extend<00:06:02.659> it<00:06:02.809> out

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.879 

so<00:06:07.069> being<00:06:07.279> we<00:06:07.489> use<00:06:07.879> a<00:06:07.909> ball

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
so being we use a ball

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.199 
so being we use a ball
swift<00:06:10.179> 34<00:06:12.099> so<00:06:13.099> this<00:06:13.249> is<00:06:13.369> what<00:06:13.489> completes

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:14.209 
swift 34 so this is what completes

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:17.499 
swift 34 so this is what completes
obliques<00:06:15.199> abs<00:06:15.699> keep<00:06:16.699> it<00:06:16.819> inside<00:06:17.089> so<00:06:17.300> it's

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
obliques abs keep it inside so it's

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:25.419 
obliques abs keep it inside so it's
outside<00:06:23.019> the<00:06:24.019> freeway<00:06:24.439> when<00:06:24.709> I'm<00:06:24.860> doing<00:06:25.189> them

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:25.429 
outside the freeway when I'm doing them

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.419 
outside the freeway when I'm doing them
I<00:06:25.729> keep<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.839> tighter<00:06:27.619> farm

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:28.429
