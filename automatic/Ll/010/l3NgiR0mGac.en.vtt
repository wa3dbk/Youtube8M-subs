not getting all the colors and tones and
stuff<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.619> would<00:02:05.710> normally<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:06.009> them

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
either mouthpiece and of course it's a

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.440 
either mouthpiece and of course it's a
lot<00:02:09.729> deeper<00:02:10.479> than<00:02:11.140> when<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.100> play<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.640> rim

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
lot deeper than when I play on the rim

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.080 
lot deeper than when I play on the rim
is<00:02:13.600> not<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:13.900> wide<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.410> believe<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.220> quite

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

significantly<00:02:16.959> deeper
