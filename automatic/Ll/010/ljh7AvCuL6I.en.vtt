00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.122
 Tyria 

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.761
 The Dragons have always been here, 

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:37.266
 sleeping in the depths of the earth, deep in the ocean. 

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.041
 Waiting for the time to emerge. 

00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:54.117
 A hundred years ago Orr's sunken empire returned to the surface under the command of the dragon. 

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:01.993
 A dragon whose name is written in the legends of the dwarves. 

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.131
 A dragon known as Zhaitan. 

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:16.172
 The army without soul arose from the waters, hungry for destruction. 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.149
 Our ancestors fought against the tide, but the power of Zhaitan was very great. 

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:34.457
 We have learned from these defeats. We learn that no nation can fight alone and win. 

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:42.160
 The five races must unite against their enemies, and not surrender. 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:55.240
 Heroes gather in glory, discovering new spells, new technologies that will save our world. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.860
 It is time for legends to become real. 

00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:17.150
 Now is the time! Fight for your destiny. Forge your legend! 

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:48.150
