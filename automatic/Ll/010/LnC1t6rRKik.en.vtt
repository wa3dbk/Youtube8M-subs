the new iMac so a 27-inch iMac with a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.119 
the new iMac so a 27-inch iMac with a
second<00:00:35.790> 27-inch<00:00:36.559> cinema<00:00:37.559> display<00:00:37.860> will<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
second 27-inch cinema display will be a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000 
second 27-inch cinema display will be a
6<00:00:38.430> setup<00:00:39.260> expensive<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.920> would

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
6 setup expensive but I think that would

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
6 setup expensive but I think that would
be<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> insane<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.690> I'm

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
be kind of insane to have that so I'm

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.090 
be kind of insane to have that so I'm
looking<00:00:43.110> forward<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.680> anyone<00:00:43.950> gets

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
looking forward to see if anyone gets

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
looking forward to see if anyone gets
that<00:00:44.280> set<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:46.399> with<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.410> effectively

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that set up so with this the effectively

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.850 
that set up so with this the effectively
the<00:00:49.620> 24<00:00:50.129> inch<00:00:50.340> model<00:00:50.700> gets<00:00:50.879> dropped<00:00:51.149> down<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the 24 inch model gets dropped down to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
the 24 inch model gets dropped down to
$7.99<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.840> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:55.050> too

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
$7.99 so I think that's kind of way too

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.139 
$7.99 so I think that's kind of way too
pricey<00:00:55.530> still<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> 24<00:00:56.730> inch<00:00:56.850> model

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
pricey still for the 24 inch model

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.430 
pricey still for the 24 inch model
especially<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.840> release<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> was

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
especially with this release I was

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
especially with this release I was
really<00:00:58.710> kind<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> hoping<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.579> drop

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
really kind of hoping that would drop

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740 
really kind of hoping that would drop
down<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.539> maybe<00:01:00.949> $6.99<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.520> even<00:01:02.850> need<00:01:03.090> $5.99

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
down to maybe $6.99 we even need $5.99

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.420 
down to maybe $6.99 we even need $5.99
but<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> looks<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.650> we're<00:01:04.830> getting<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> 7<00:01:05.280> in

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
but it looks like we're getting a 7 in

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.240 
but it looks like we're getting a 7 in
$7.99<00:01:06.330> price<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> discount

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
$7.99 price a little bit of discount

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
$7.99 price a little bit of discount
with<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> student<00:01:08.939> discount<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
with a student discount but I think the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
with a student discount but I think the
24<00:01:10.470> inch<00:01:10.619> model<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.790> pricey<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
24 inch model is a little bit pricey and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.810 
24 inch model is a little bit pricey and
I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> 27-inch<00:01:14.130> model<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> better

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I think the 27-inch model is a better

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.899 
I think the 27-inch model is a better
Buy<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.930> far<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> goes<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.040> nothing<00:01:17.759> new

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
Buy as far as that goes so nothing new

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
Buy as far as that goes so nothing new
as<00:01:18.090> far<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.420> specs<00:01:18.780> from<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> old<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
as far as specs from the old one just a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
as far as specs from the old one just a
bigger<00:01:19.890> size<00:01:20.189> bigger<00:01:20.610> resolution<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
bigger size bigger resolution so it's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
bigger size bigger resolution so it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to see how this is gonna work it seems

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
to see how this is gonna work it seems

if this is gonna really hold a place I
especially<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> Magic<00:01:35.460> Mouse<00:01:35.640> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
especially if you have a Magic Mouse but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
especially if you have a Magic Mouse but
I<00:01:36.030> ordered<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> review<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> for<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I ordered one just to review it for you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.420 
I ordered one just to review it for you
guys

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
guys

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.399 
guys
and<00:01:38.880> we'll<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> goes<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:39.990> far<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and we'll see how it goes as far as a

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.770 
and we'll see how it goes as far as a
couple<00:01:40.799> days<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> goes

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
couple days of use and see what it goes

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.770 
couple days of use and see what it goes
so<00:01:42.930> basically<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.470> bait<00:01:44.420> bringing<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so basically this is bait bringing the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.389 
so basically this is bait bringing the
touchpad<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> MacBook<00:01:46.950> Pros<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
touchpad from the MacBook Pros and the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.630 
touchpad from the MacBook Pros and the
MacBooks<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.689> desktop<00:01:49.049> form<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> Mac<00:01:50.369> Mac

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
MacBooks to desktop form so I Mac Mac

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060 
MacBooks to desktop form so I Mac Mac
Pro<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.420> gonna<00:01:51.659> allow<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> use<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
Pro it's gonna allow you to use that so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
Pro it's gonna allow you to use that so
this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.220> wireless<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.119> cool<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.509> not

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then let's get into the Mac Pro's so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.800 
and then let's get into the Mac Pro's so
this<00:02:15.900> was<00:02:16.170> actually<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:17.090> long<00:02:18.090> wait<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.720> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
this was actually a long wait I think it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.810 
this was actually a long wait I think it
was<00:02:18.900> over<00:02:19.250> hundreds<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.370> hundreds<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.640> days

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
was over hundreds and hundreds of days

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.400 
was over hundreds and hundreds of days

before since they last updated it and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.460 
before since they last updated it and
long<00:02:22.950> overdue<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.460> these<00:02:23.700> ship<00:02:24.030> August<00:02:24.600> we're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
gonna get a couple different

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.790 
gonna get a couple different
configurations<00:02:27.240> quad-core<00:02:27.930> six<00:02:28.380> core<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.770> core

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
configurations quad-core six core a core

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.100 
configurations quad-core six core a core
or<00:02:29.190> twelve<00:02:29.520> core<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.270> twelve<00:02:30.570> core<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.930> gonna

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
or twelve core the twelve core is gonna

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.440 
or twelve core the twelve core is gonna
start<00:02:31.380> at<00:02:31.530> five<00:02:31.830> grand<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:33.030> not<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
start at five grand so it's not going to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
start at five grand so it's not going to
be<00:02:33.540> cheap<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.140> thing<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.500> gonna<00:02:34.620> be

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
be cheap but this thing is gonna be

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.700 
be cheap but this thing is gonna be
insane<00:02:35.370> as<00:02:36.270> far<00:02:36.540> as<00:02:36.570> processing<00:02:37.350> power<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
insane as far as processing power so

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.170 
insane as far as processing power so
I'll<00:02:37.920> give<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.100> guys<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> rundown<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
I'll give you guys a rundown of the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.800 
I'll give you guys a rundown of the
features<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.610> gonna<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:41.850> actually

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
features so this is gonna be actually

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 
features so this is gonna be actually
since<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> hyper<00:02:43.950> threading<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.700> OS

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
since with the hyper threading the OS

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.540 
since with the hyper threading the OS
will<00:02:45.240> see<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.750> twelve<00:02:45.990> core<00:02:46.200> has<00:02:46.320> 24<00:02:47.130> threads

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
will see the twelve core has 24 threads

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.229 
will see the twelve core has 24 threads
are<00:02:47.820> 24<00:02:48.480> cores<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:49.980> thing<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.340> gonna<00:02:50.550> tear

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
are 24 cores so this thing is gonna tear

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.170 
are 24 cores so this thing is gonna tear
it<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:52.800> gonna<00:02:52.890> be<00:02:53.070> expensive<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:53.640> I'm

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
thinking of over how powerful it's gonna

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.010 
thinking of over how powerful it's gonna
be<00:02:57.920> kind<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.980> drooling<00:02:59.310> over<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.750> love<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> pick

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
said we get some new processors now what

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.410 
said we get some new processors now what
I'm<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.190> excited<00:03:17.370> about<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.060> actually<00:03:18.209> the

256 2 megabyte ATI card in there so we

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.009 
256 2 megabyte ATI card in there so we
finally<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> fifty<00:03:33.030> seven<00:03:33.330> seventy<00:03:33.720> stock

may not know if you guys are PC guys but

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.960 
may not know if you guys are PC guys but
that's<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:41.010> much<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> best<00:03:41.580> thing<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
that's pretty much the best thing in the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.910 
that's pretty much the best thing in the
book<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.299> not<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> top-of-the-line

book it's not the top-of-the-line
graphics<00:03:43.920> card<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.280> for<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.670> money<00:03:44.910> that's

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
graphics card but for the money that's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.990 
graphics card but for the money that's
really<00:03:46.230> where<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.620> at<00:03:46.709> as<00:03:47.100> far<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.370> video

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
really where it's at as far as video

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.930 
really where it's at as far as video
cards<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:48.570> with<00:03:48.690> ATI<00:03:49.200> brings<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.430> Eyefinity

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
cards now with ATI brings the Eyefinity

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.340 
cards now with ATI brings the Eyefinity
technology<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.660> we'll<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:51.930> get<00:03:52.290> a

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
technology so we'll actually get a

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.370 
technology so we'll actually get a
support<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.010> six<00:03:53.519> monitors<00:03:54.140> right<00:03:55.140> off<00:03:55.350> of

support up to six monitors right off of
the<00:03:55.560> video<00:03:55.830> card<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.549> that's<00:03:57.150> one<00:03:57.360> thing<00:03:57.540> that

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the video card so that's one thing that

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.289 
the video card so that's one thing that
I'm<00:03:57.780> really<00:03:57.959> excited<00:03:58.080> about<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.769> really<00:03:59.299> for

I'm really excited about and really for
someone<00:04:00.660> wanting<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.110> all-in-one<00:04:01.560> solution

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769

whether you're doing a rendering now you

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.000 
whether you're doing a rendering now you
can<00:04:03.540> do<00:04:03.690> some<00:04:03.900> high-end<00:04:04.290> gaming<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.830> that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
can do some high-end gaming with that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.070 
can do some high-end gaming with that
because<00:04:05.190> that's<00:04:05.400> really<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.670> gaming<00:04:06.060> card<00:04:06.330> so

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
because that's really a gaming card so

thing's<00:04:10.230> gonna<00:04:10.410> tear<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.799> up<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.519> get<00:04:11.700> faster

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
thing's gonna tear it up you get faster

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.009 
thing's gonna tear it up you get faster
memory<00:04:13.160> faster<00:04:14.160> speed<00:04:14.400> with<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:15.329> six<00:04:15.570> core<00:04:15.780> or

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
memory faster speed with the six core or

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.349 
memory faster speed with the six core or
the<00:04:16.049> 12<00:04:16.500> core<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:18.000> thing<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.239> going

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
the 12 core so like this thing is going

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.550 
the 12 core so like this thing is going
to<00:04:18.479> be<00:04:18.660> insane

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
to be insane

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.760 
to be insane
I<00:04:19.590> would<00:04:20.370> love<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.609> test<00:04:20.940> one<00:04:21.209> out<00:04:21.359> but<00:04:22.289> for<00:04:22.650> now

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
I would love to test one out but for now

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.550 
I would love to test one out but for now
we'll<00:04:22.919> see<00:04:23.099> some<00:04:23.310> reviews<00:04:23.490> on<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.440> I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
we'll see some reviews on it and like I

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.030 
we'll see some reviews on it and like I
said<00:04:25.770> for<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.070> money<00:04:26.460> it's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
said for the money it's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.460 
said for the money it's
gonna<00:04:27.220> be<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> killer<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:28.090> workhorse<00:04:29.080> machine

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
gonna be a killer of workhorse machine

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.990 
gonna be a killer of workhorse machine
compared<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.040> old<00:04:30.220> models<00:04:30.580> it's<00:04:30.700> going<00:04:30.940> to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
compared to the old models it's going to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000 
compared to the old models it's going to
be<00:04:31.060> expensive<00:04:31.300> like<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:31.630> said<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:32.860> gonna

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
be expensive like I said but it's gonna

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.460 
be expensive like I said but it's gonna
be<00:04:33.190> nuts<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:34.150> you<00:04:34.210> have<00:04:34.480> they<00:04:35.170> didn't<00:04:35.350> change

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
be nuts so you have they didn't change

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.800 
be nuts so you have they didn't change
the<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.070> external<00:04:36.550> look<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:37.240> get<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.540> same

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
the the external look we get the same

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.230 
the the external look we get the same
amount<00:04:38.110> of<00:04:38.610> enclosure<00:04:39.610> as<00:04:39.820> far<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.060> storage

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
amount of enclosure as far as storage

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.910 
amount of enclosure as far as storage
goes<00:04:40.600> they<00:04:41.140> are<00:04:41.170> going<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.530> allow<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.770> to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
goes they are going to allow you to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.640 
goes they are going to allow you to
configure<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.520> with<00:04:42.580> SSDs<00:04:43.330> from<00:04:43.750> maximum<00:04:44.350> sure

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
configure it with SSDs from maximum sure

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.770 
configure it with SSDs from maximum sure
I<00:04:44.890> don't<00:04:45.430> even<00:04:45.520> want<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.940> imagine<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.540> price

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
I don't even want to imagine the price

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.230 
I don't even want to imagine the price
of<00:04:47.110> configuring<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:47.890> with<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.160> 512<00:04:48.940> gig<00:04:49.150> SSD

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
of configuring that with a 512 gig SSD

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.280 
of configuring that with a 512 gig SSD
for<00:04:52.240> those<00:04:52.480> in<00:04:52.660> there<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:52.930> that's<00:04:53.020> probably

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
for those in there so that's probably

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.740 
for those in there so that's probably
gonna<00:04:53.470> be<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.740> 10<00:04:54.040> grand<00:04:54.250> but<00:04:54.700> as<00:04:55.090> always

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
gonna be like 10 grand but as always

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.260 
gonna be like 10 grand but as always
with<00:04:55.930> these<00:04:56.170> Mac<00:04:56.560> Pro's<00:04:56.860> are<00:04:57.100> really<00:04:57.490> easy<00:04:57.940> to

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
with these Mac Pro's are really easy to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.850 
with these Mac Pro's are really easy to
change<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.720> components<00:04:59.290> out<00:04:59.410> so<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.770> would

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
change the components out so I would

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.920 
change the components out so I would
recommend<00:05:00.430> not<00:05:00.490> ordering<00:05:01.090> SSDs<00:05:01.630> through

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
recommend not ordering SSDs through

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.380 
recommend not ordering SSDs through
Apple<00:05:02.290> I<00:05:02.680> would<00:05:03.280> order<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.520> stock<00:05:03.880> as<00:05:04.090> far<00:05:04.300> as

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
Apple I would order it stock as far as

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.030 
Apple I would order it stock as far as
the<00:05:04.480> hard<00:05:04.660> drive<00:05:04.840> configuration<00:05:05.620> goes<00:05:05.800> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
the hard drive configuration goes and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.350 
the hard drive configuration goes and
then<00:05:06.130> doing<00:05:06.370> everything<00:05:06.610> off<00:05:06.850> your<00:05:07.060> stuff<00:05:07.240> you

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
then doing everything off your stuff you

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360 
then doing everything off your stuff you
can<00:05:07.510> pick<00:05:07.660> up<00:05:07.750> some<00:05:07.810> nice<00:05:08.250> terabyte<00:05:09.250> hard

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
can pick up some nice terabyte hard

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.980 
can pick up some nice terabyte hard
drives<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:09.790> 2<00:05:10.000> terabyte<00:05:10.420> hard<00:05:10.570> drives<00:05:10.840> and

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
drives and 2 terabyte hard drives and

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.200 
drives and 2 terabyte hard drives and
then<00:05:11.110> some<00:05:11.230> SSDs<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.040> really<00:05:12.700> pop<00:05:12.910> them<00:05:13.090> in

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
then some SSDs and really pop them in

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.550 
then some SSDs and really pop them in
there<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.450> save<00:05:13.630> yourself<00:05:13.990> quite<00:05:14.260> a<00:05:14.290> bit<00:05:14.470> of

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
there and save yourself quite a bit of

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.470 
there and save yourself quite a bit of
money<00:05:14.680> same<00:05:15.010> thing<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> memory<00:05:15.760> but

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
money same thing with the memory but

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.240 
money same thing with the memory but
we'll<00:05:16.600> see<00:05:16.780> as<00:05:16.930> far<00:05:17.140> as<00:05:17.290> that<00:05:17.440> goes<00:05:17.500> once<00:05:18.070> they

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
we'll see as far as that goes once they

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.820 
we'll see as far as that goes once they
get<00:05:18.400> updated<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.300> guess<00:05:20.110> if<00:05:20.230> these<00:05:20.350> ship<00:05:20.620> in

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830

get updated so I guess if these ship in
August<00:05:21.250> we'll<00:05:22.240> get<00:05:22.480> some<00:05:22.660> more<00:05:22.750> information
