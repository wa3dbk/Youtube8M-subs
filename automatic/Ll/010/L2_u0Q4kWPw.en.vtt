00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
thing to look like when I was first in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.039 
thing to look like when I was first in
the<00:01:13.140> design<00:01:13.560> phase<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.790> tank<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the design phase of this tank is I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.340 
the design phase of this tank is I
wanted<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.759> fish<00:01:18.060> pop<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.810> only

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
wanted it to make the fish pop I only

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.710 
wanted it to make the fish pop I only
wanted<00:01:19.950> focus<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> fish<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> wanted

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
wanted focus on the fish I wanted

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
wanted focus on the fish I wanted
everything<00:01:21.990> else<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.500> secondary<00:01:23.100> um<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
everything else to be secondary um I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.590 
everything else to be secondary um I
still<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.560> her<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.220> nice-looking

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
still want her to be really nice-looking

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
still want her to be really nice-looking
but<00:01:27.600> focus<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> fish<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.880> how<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
but focus is on the fish so how would I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.620 
but focus is on the fish so how would I
do<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
do that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890 
do that
well<00:01:31.579> let's<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.939> over<00:01:33.150> laying<00:01:33.570> real

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
well let's just go over laying real

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
well let's just go over laying real
quick<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> lighting<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> would

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
quick and not the lighting you would

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.149 
quick and not the lighting you would
think<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.780> lighting<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.350> course<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
think of the lighting of course the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
think of the lighting of course the
source<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.729> coming<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.420> top<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.930> here

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
source is coming from the top right here

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.100 
source is coming from the top right here
but<00:01:41.570> physics<00:01:42.570> okay<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.920> basic<00:01:44.399> physics

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
but physics okay really basic physics

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
but physics okay really basic physics
lights<00:01:46.110> reflected<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.890> crazy<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
lights reflected like crazy and that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.410 
lights reflected like crazy and that
will<00:01:47.970> light<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.210> tank<00:01:48.509> too<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:50.149> if<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
will light up your tank too so if you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
will light up your tank too so if you
have<00:01:51.689> white<00:01:52.560> rocks<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.700> brown<00:01:54.060> rocks

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
have white rocks in here or brown rocks

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
have white rocks in here or brown rocks
it's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> reflect<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> lot<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> light

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it's going to reflect a lot of light

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.870 
it's going to reflect a lot of light
white<00:01:56.909> rocks<00:01:57.180> reflect<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.899> light<00:01:58.200> or

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
white rocks reflect all light or

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.570 
white rocks reflect all light or
theoretically<00:01:59.880> pure<00:02:00.240> wipers<00:02:00.659> legs<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.020> white

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
theoretically pure wipers legs all white

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.050 
theoretically pure wipers legs all white
do<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.110> real<00:02:03.260> world<00:02:03.550> black<00:02:04.550> absorbs

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
do that in the real world black absorbs

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.230 
do that in the real world black absorbs
most<00:02:05.690> it's<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.260> all<00:02:06.500> light<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.550> obviously

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
most it's not all light this obviously

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.730 
most it's not all light this obviously
is<00:02:08.420> not<00:02:08.600> absorbing<00:02:08.990> all<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.290> light<00:02:09.440> or<00:02:09.619> else

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
is not absorbing all the light or else

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.070 
is not absorbing all the light or else
you<00:02:09.860> wouldn't<00:02:10.160> see<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.600> like<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.630> black<00:02:11.900> hole

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
you wouldn't see it like a black hole

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.680 
you wouldn't see it like a black hole
but<00:02:13.120> yeah<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.340> how<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.370> did<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.850> was<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> decided

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
but yeah so how I did this was I decided

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.470 
but yeah so how I did this was I decided
to<00:02:17.810> go<00:02:17.990> with<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> black<00:02:18.620> background<00:02:19.090> there<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
to go with a black background there that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
to go with a black background there that
way<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.690> wouldn't<00:02:21.020> reflect<00:02:21.380> any<00:02:21.770> light<00:02:21.860> off<00:02:22.250> of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
way I wouldn't reflect any light off of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.740 
way I wouldn't reflect any light off of
the<00:02:22.520> background<00:02:22.970> making<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.360> tanks<00:02:23.660> an

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the background making the tanks an

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.640 
the background making the tanks an
extremely<00:02:24.200> bright

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
extremely bright

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.370 
extremely bright
so<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.580> light<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.000> being<00:02:26.330> absorbed<00:02:26.450> with<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
so all light is being absorbed with the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.750 
so all light is being absorbed with the
background<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.540> decided<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.660> go<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.140> subtle

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
background I decided to go for subtle

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.330 
background I decided to go for subtle
rocks<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.150> my<00:02:32.330> son<00:02:32.540> rock<00:02:32.840> scape<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.410> decided<00:02:34.130> to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
rocks for my son rock scape I decided to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.070 
rocks for my son rock scape I decided to
go<00:02:34.490> for<00:02:34.700> slate<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.360> don't<00:02:35.660> know<00:02:35.720> where<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.960> get

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
go for slate I don't know where to get

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.550 
go for slate I don't know where to get
this<00:02:36.320> in<00:02:36.560> your<00:02:36.850> local<00:02:37.850> area<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:39.050> know<00:02:39.410> it's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
this in your local area I just know it's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740 
this in your local area I just know it's
largely<00:02:39.950> pieces<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.360> got<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.570> from<00:02:41.660> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
largely pieces and I got it from a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.110 
largely pieces and I got it from a
landscaping<00:02:42.230> company<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.790> reason<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
landscaping company and the reason I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.490 
landscaping company and the reason I
went<00:02:44.300> with<00:02:44.390> these<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.840> because<00:02:45.110> they're<00:02:45.290> black

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
went with these is because they're black

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.710 
went with these is because they're black
but<00:02:46.370> they<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.000> cool<00:02:47.150> patterns<00:02:47.540> on

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
but they have really cool patterns on

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.000 
but they have really cool patterns on
them<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.959> sort<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.170> makes<00:02:48.380> them<00:02:48.530> pop<00:02:48.800> out

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
them it's sort of makes them pop out

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.030 
them it's sort of makes them pop out
secondary<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.940> fish<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.080> it's<00:02:51.770> sort<00:02:51.980> of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
secondary to the fish so it's sort of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.400 
secondary to the fish so it's sort of
like<00:02:52.190> art<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.270> like<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.930> got<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.170> put<00:02:54.320> it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
like art you know like you got to put it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.020 
like art you know like you got to put it
together<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.770> everything<00:02:55.310> looks<00:02:55.520> just<00:02:55.880> right

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
together so everything looks just right

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.699 
together so everything looks just right
got<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.720> play<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.230> little<00:02:57.350> bit<00:02:57.470> that's

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
got to play with it a little bit that's

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.160 
got to play with it a little bit that's
what<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.920> did

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
what I did

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.070 
what I did
so<00:03:00.370> these<00:03:01.370> rocks<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.880> also<00:03:02.060> absorbing<00:03:02.870> all

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
so these rocks are also absorbing all

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.949 
so these rocks are also absorbing all
light<00:03:03.380> or<00:03:03.650> most<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.640> they're<00:03:04.850> not

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
light or most of it so they're not

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.420 
light or most of it so they're not
glowing<00:03:05.959> they're<00:03:06.290> not<00:03:06.440> popping<00:03:06.800> out<00:03:07.130> they're

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
glowing they're not popping out they're

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.970 
glowing they're not popping out they're
not<00:03:07.459> getting<00:03:07.880> your<00:03:08.000> attention<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.860> decided<00:03:09.860> to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
not getting your attention I decided to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.800 
not getting your attention I decided to
go<00:03:10.130> with<00:03:10.160> white<00:03:10.700> sand<00:03:11.060> because<00:03:11.420> it's<00:03:11.600> very

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
go with white sand because it's very

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.500 
go with white sand because it's very
buff<00:03:12.080> it's<00:03:12.320> at<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> very<00:03:12.560> bottom<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:14.330> may

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
buff it's at the very bottom and it may

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.960 
buff it's at the very bottom and it may
be<00:03:14.570> reflecting<00:03:15.230> most<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.800> not<00:03:15.830> all<00:03:16.010> light<00:03:16.459> but

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
be reflecting most if not all light but

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.790 
be reflecting most if not all light but
it<00:03:17.600> reflects<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.140> back<00:03:18.170> up<00:03:18.620> onto<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.130> fish<00:03:20.800> how

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
it reflects it back up onto the fish how

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.250 
it reflects it back up onto the fish how
it<00:03:21.890> works<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.720> it's<00:03:23.720> got<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.930> really<00:03:24.110> nice

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
it works and it's got a really nice

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.320 
it works and it's got a really nice
contrast<00:03:24.830> with<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.310> black<00:03:25.489> rock<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.209> think

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
contrast with the black rock so I think

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.120 
contrast with the black rock so I think
that<00:03:26.540> looks<00:03:26.690> nice<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.260> when<00:03:27.739> I'm<00:03:27.860> shooting

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
that looks nice and when I'm shooting

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.940 
that looks nice and when I'm shooting
photos<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:29.120> allows<00:03:30.110> some<00:03:30.380> reflection<00:03:30.860> of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
photos it allows some reflection of

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.860 
photos it allows some reflection of
light<00:03:31.100> back<00:03:31.280> up<00:03:31.489> under<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.910> fish<00:03:32.120> which<00:03:32.630> makes

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
light back up under the fish which makes

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.900 
light back up under the fish which makes
it<00:03:33.019> look<00:03:33.110> very<00:03:33.320> nice<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.580> don't<00:03:34.760> really

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
it look very nice and you don't really

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.030 
it look very nice and you don't really
see<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.450> because<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.050> don't<00:03:36.110> take<00:03:36.410> photos<00:03:36.650> near

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
see it because I don't take photos near

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.990 
see it because I don't take photos near
the<00:03:37.190> sand<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.570> yeah<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.220> how<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.640> set<00:03:40.970> up

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
the sand it so yeah that is how I set up

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.330 
the sand it so yeah that is how I set up
my<00:03:41.090> tank<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.410> reason<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:42.890> works<00:03:43.100> like

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
my tank and the reason it works like

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.600 
my tank and the reason it works like
that

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
that

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.170 
that
is<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.340> only<00:03:46.670> thing

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
is just because the only thing

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.870 
is just because the only thing
reflecting<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.290> ton<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.560> light<00:03:48.860> my<00:03:49.070> tank<00:03:49.370> is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
reflecting a ton of light my tank is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.700 
reflecting a ton of light my tank is
San<00:03:50.090> Bay<00:03:50.360> which<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.780> don't<00:03:51.020> see<00:03:51.110> very<00:03:51.290> often

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
San Bay which you don't see very often

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.530 
San Bay which you don't see very often
and<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.640> course<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.210> fish<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:54.200> want<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> fish

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and of course the fish you want the fish

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.760 
and of course the fish you want the fish
standing<00:03:56.540> out<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:56.810> much<00:03:56.990> as<00:03:57.140> possible<00:03:57.350> if<00:03:57.740> you

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
standing out as much as possible if you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.040 
standing out as much as possible if you
want<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.070> tank<00:03:58.280> like<00:03:58.490> this<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.030> that's<00:03:59.630> exactly

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
want a tank like this and that's exactly

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.450 
want a tank like this and that's exactly
how<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.440> did<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:02.440> yeah<00:04:03.440> that's<00:04:03.890> pretty<00:04:04.040> much

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
how I did it so yeah that's pretty much

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.550 
how I did it so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:04:04.610> that's<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.450> basics<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.320> really

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
it that's the basics of it I really

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.710 
it that's the basics of it I really
don't<00:04:06.740> want<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.920> go<00:04:07.010> any<00:04:07.160> deeper<00:04:07.370> because<00:04:08.360> that

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
don't want to go any deeper because that

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.400 
don't want to go any deeper because that
wouldn't<00:04:09.170> benefit<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:09.950> guys<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.310> all<00:04:10.400> um<00:04:11.410> but

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
wouldn't benefit you guys at all um but

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.890 
wouldn't benefit you guys at all um but
I<00:04:12.440> do<00:04:12.560> want<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:12.980> discuss<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.270> more<00:04:14.300> thing<00:04:14.720> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
I do want to discuss one more thing and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.520 
I do want to discuss one more thing and
that<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.230> lighting<00:04:15.710> on<00:04:15.890> fish<00:04:16.130> behavior<00:04:17.230> on<00:04:18.230> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
that is lighting on fish behavior on the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.780 
that is lighting on fish behavior on the
proponent<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.580> low<00:04:19.790> life<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.860> think<00:04:21.860> too<00:04:22.610> many

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
proponent to low life I think too many

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.180 
proponent to low life I think too many
people<00:04:23.270> over<00:04:23.690> saturate<00:04:24.230> their<00:04:24.410> tanks<00:04:24.770> with<00:04:24.950> a

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
people over saturate their tanks with a

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.460 
people over saturate their tanks with a
ton<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.580> light<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.660> may<00:04:26.780> stress<00:04:27.140> out<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
ton of light and it may stress out the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.420 
ton of light and it may stress out the
fish<00:04:27.760> um<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:30.020> may<00:04:30.170> notice<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.530> my<00:04:30.740> tank<00:04:31.190> has

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
fish um you may notice that my tank has

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.160 
fish um you may notice that my tank has
a<00:04:31.460> light<00:04:31.880> beam<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:32.300> down<00:04:32.570> here<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.020> have<00:04:33.110> a

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
a light beam going down here so I have a

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.250 
a light beam going down here so I have a
dark<00:04:33.470> spot<00:04:33.590> right<00:04:33.980> up<00:04:34.130> here<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.750> some

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
dark spot right up here I have some

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.870 
dark spot right up here I have some
sub-dominant<00:04:36.710> fish<00:04:37.100> in<00:04:37.250> my<00:04:37.370> tank<00:04:37.610> that

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
sub-dominant fish in my tank that

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.660 
sub-dominant fish in my tank that
sometimes<00:04:38.300> get<00:04:38.540> picked<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.440> they<00:04:40.430> really

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
sometimes get picked on and they really

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.760 
sometimes get picked on and they really
like<00:04:40.910> hiding<00:04:41.300> up<00:04:41.450> here<00:04:41.480> this<00:04:41.870> mulato<00:04:42.290> is<00:04:42.680> a

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
like hiding up here this mulato is a

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.160 
like hiding up here this mulato is a
very<00:04:43.070> shy<00:04:43.370> species<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.210> he<00:04:44.810> would<00:04:44.960> not<00:04:45.110> have

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
very shy species and he would not have

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.810 
very shy species and he would not have
the<00:04:45.470> color<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.890> he<00:04:45.980> has<00:04:46.160> in<00:04:46.370> my<00:04:46.490> all-metal

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
the color that he has in my all-metal

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.270 
the color that he has in my all-metal
tank<00:04:47.090> if<00:04:47.300> there<00:04:47.450> was<00:04:47.570> not<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.110> light<00:04:48.440> or<00:04:49.250> that

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
tank if there was not that light or that

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.460 
tank if there was not that light or that
absence<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:50.000> light<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.480> corner<00:04:50.780> there<00:04:50.810> he

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
absence of light in that corner there he

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.950 
absence of light in that corner there he
hangs<00:04:51.680> out<00:04:51.860> up<00:04:52.010> there<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.400> little<00:04:52.730> bit<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
hangs out up there a little bit the the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.530 
hangs out up there a little bit the the
Jake<00:04:54.860> back<00:04:55.100> there<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.520> cake<00:04:55.820> McClure<00:04:56.210> or

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
Jake back there that cake McClure or

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.930 
Jake back there that cake McClure or
whatever<00:04:56.810> he<00:04:56.900> happens<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.350> be<00:04:57.460> he<00:04:58.460> hangs<00:04:58.730> out

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
whatever he happens to be he hangs out

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.390 
whatever he happens to be he hangs out
in<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.210> back<00:04:59.450> with<00:05:00.380> no<00:05:00.410> light<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.370> think

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
in the back with no light and I think

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.340 
in the back with no light and I think
what<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:02.120> does<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.750> when<00:05:02.930> they're<00:05:03.110> stressed

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
what that does is when they're stressed

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.170 
what that does is when they're stressed
they<00:05:03.590> go<00:05:03.740> back<00:05:03.950> there<00:05:04.250> they<00:05:04.550> sit<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:05.090> they

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
they go back there they sit and they

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.410 
they go back there they sit and they
calm<00:05:05.570> down<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.400> they're<00:05:07.400> less<00:05:07.640> likely<00:05:07.880> to

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
calm down and they're less likely to

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.230 
calm down and they're less likely to
develop<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.230> disease<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:10.220> know<00:05:10.340> parasites<00:05:10.970> or

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
develop a disease you know parasites or

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.080 
develop a disease you know parasites or
anything<00:05:11.450> like<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.200> I<00:05:13.070> think<00:05:13.850> it's<00:05:13.970> very

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
anything like that so I think it's very

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.640 
anything like that so I think it's very
important<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.600> have<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.080> think<00:05:15.110> that<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.530> got

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
important to have and I think that I got

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.850 
important to have and I think that I got
lucky<00:05:15.890> with<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.280> 48<00:05:16.700> inch<00:05:16.820> fixture<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.860> it's

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
lucky with the 48 inch fixture and it's

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.430 
lucky with the 48 inch fixture and it's
really<00:05:19.130> helping<00:05:19.370> me<00:05:19.460> out<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.930> overall

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
really helping me out in the overall

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.730 
really helping me out in the overall
lighting<00:05:21.740> as<00:05:22.010> well<00:05:22.580> having<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.480> dark<00:05:23.780> rock

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
lighting as well having a dark rock

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.650 
lighting as well having a dark rock
scape<00:05:25.070> allows<00:05:25.760> you<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.030> have<00:05:26.150> low<00:05:26.360> lighting

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
scape allows you to have low lighting

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.750 
scape allows you to have low lighting
that<00:05:27.170> still<00:05:27.500> makes<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.920> fish<00:05:28.070> pop<00:05:28.370> without

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
that still makes the fish pop without

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.400 
that still makes the fish pop without
having<00:05:29.150> extremely<00:05:29.690> intense<00:05:30.350> light<00:05:31.510> so<00:05:32.510> this

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
having extremely intense light so this

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.800 
having extremely intense light so this
also<00:05:33.710> lowers<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.280> stress<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.730> fish<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:35.210> lot

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
also lowers the stress of the fish a lot

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.690 
also lowers the stress of the fish a lot
of<00:05:35.900> people<00:05:36.140> are<00:05:36.290> obsessed<00:05:36.440> with<00:05:36.830> having<00:05:37.130> you

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
of people are obsessed with having you

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.360 
of people are obsessed with having you
know<00:05:37.820> natural-looking<00:05:38.810> biotope<00:05:39.560> natural

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
know natural-looking biotope natural

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.860 
know natural-looking biotope natural
full<00:05:40.640> spectrum<00:05:41.150> lighting<00:05:41.420> for<00:05:41.750> these

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
full spectrum lighting for these

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.300 
full spectrum lighting for these
cichlids<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.380> then<00:05:42.560> they<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.830> freaking

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
and watch and dive you you can't tell me

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.410 
and watch and dive you you can't tell me
that<00:05:53.520> there's<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.880> lot<00:05:54.090> of<00:05:54.210> light<00:05:54.330> that

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
that there's a lot of light that

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.330 
that there's a lot of light that
penetrates<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:55.050> know<00:05:55.200> 20<00:05:55.650> meters<00:05:55.980> below<00:05:56.190> the

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
penetrates you know 20 meters below the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.580 
penetrates you know 20 meters below the
surface<00:05:56.610> about<00:05:56.910> water<00:05:57.210> it's<00:05:57.930> very<00:05:57.990> dark

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
surface about water it's very dark

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.270 
surface about water it's very dark
it's<00:05:58.830> very<00:05:59.100> dim<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.700> very<00:05:59.910> cloudy<00:06:00.210> so<00:06:01.280> when

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
it's very dim it's very cloudy so when

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.340 
it's very dim it's very cloudy so when
you<00:06:02.370> have<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.550> crystal-clear<00:06:03.390> tank<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.900> this

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
you have a crystal-clear tank like this

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.160 
you have a crystal-clear tank like this
a<00:06:05.510> lot<00:06:06.510> of<00:06:06.600> lights<00:06:06.750> going<00:06:06.900> to<00:06:06.960> penetrate

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
a lot of lights going to penetrate

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.260 
a lot of lights going to penetrate
through<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:07.830> if<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.340> over<00:06:08.610> saturate<00:06:09.060> it's

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
through and if you over saturate it's

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.760 
through and if you over saturate it's
not<00:06:09.510> going<00:06:09.720> to<00:06:09.780> be<00:06:09.840> like<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.990> natural<00:06:10.170> biotope

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
not going to be like a natural biotope

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.310 
not going to be like a natural biotope
and<00:06:11.010> they<00:06:11.910> may<00:06:12.090> get<00:06:12.240> stressed<00:06:12.540> out<00:06:12.720> so<00:06:13.140> I<00:06:13.170> think

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
and they may get stressed out so I think

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.140 
and they may get stressed out so I think
dim<00:06:13.800> lighting<00:06:14.070> is<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.490> way<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.670> go

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
dim lighting is the way to go

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.750 
dim lighting is the way to go
keeps<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.200> stress<00:06:16.410> low<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:17.040> don't<00:06:17.490> see<00:06:17.640> much

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
keeps the stress low I don't see much

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.120 
keeps the stress low I don't see much
chasing<00:06:18.270> you<00:06:18.810> can<00:06:18.960> watch<00:06:19.140> my<00:06:19.290> 15<00:06:19.650> minute<00:06:19.920> video

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
chasing you can watch my 15 minute video

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.540 
chasing you can watch my 15 minute video
of<00:06:20.190> my<00:06:20.550> fish<00:06:21.920> there's<00:06:22.920> really<00:06:23.160> nothing

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
of my fish there's really nothing

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.040 
of my fish there's really nothing
abnormal<00:06:23.700> going<00:06:24.240> on<00:06:24.360> there<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:24.690> I<00:06:24.750> think<00:06:24.810> I

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
abnormal going on there and I think I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.480 
abnormal going on there and I think I
credit<00:06:25.230> that<00:06:25.350> to<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.770> lighting<00:06:26.070> because<00:06:26.250> I

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
credit that to the lighting because I

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.120 
credit that to the lighting because I
had<00:06:26.940> a<00:06:26.970> lot<00:06:27.180> more<00:06:27.240> aggression<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.930> my<00:06:28.050> 75<00:06:28.620> with

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
had a lot more aggression to my 75 with

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.260 
had a lot more aggression to my 75 with
about<00:06:29.550> 15<00:06:30.180> species<00:06:30.660> in<00:06:31.050> there<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:32.280> had<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.760> 48

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
about 15 species in there and I had a 48

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.380 
about 15 species in there and I had a 48
to<00:06:33.420> 48<00:06:33.930> inch<00:06:34.110> strips<00:06:34.470> that<00:06:34.860> we're<00:06:35.070> just

to 48 inch strips that we're just

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.580 
to 48 inch strips that we're just
lighting<00:06:36.390> up<00:06:36.480> the<00:06:36.570> tank<00:06:36.750> let<00:06:36.930> crazy<00:06:37.170> it's<00:06:37.470> my

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
lighting up the tank let crazy it's my

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.500 
lighting up the tank let crazy it's my
first<00:06:37.890> african<00:06:38.340> cichlid<00:06:38.640> video<00:06:38.880> you<00:06:38.970> guys<00:06:39.270> can

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
first african cichlid video you guys can

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.870 
first african cichlid video you guys can
see<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.870> if<00:06:40.860> you<00:06:40.980> look<00:06:41.130> back<00:06:41.280> in<00:06:41.460> my<00:06:41.550> channel

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
see it if you look back in my channel

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.400 
see it if you look back in my channel
towards<00:06:42.090> January<00:06:43.910> but<00:06:44.910> yeah<00:06:45.150> that<00:06:45.930> should<00:06:46.260> be

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
towards January but yeah that should be

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.360 
towards January but yeah that should be
it

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
it

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.540 
it
another<00:06:48.300> very<00:06:48.570> important<00:06:49.110> thing<00:06:49.170> is<00:06:49.590> that<00:06:49.650> you

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
another very important thing is that you

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.550 
another very important thing is that you
pull<00:06:50.850> the<00:06:51.090> light<00:06:51.300> towards<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.260> front<00:06:52.470> of<00:06:52.500> the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
pull the light towards the front of the

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.130 
pull the light towards the front of the
tank<00:06:52.830> as<00:06:53.010> far<00:06:53.370> as<00:06:53.550> possible<00:06:53.790> and<00:06:54.300> what<00:06:54.960> that

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
tank as far as possible and what that

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.320 
tank as far as possible and what that
does<00:06:55.410> is<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:55.800> light<00:06:56.250> shines<00:06:56.820> down<00:06:57.030> on<00:06:57.210> the

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
does is the light shines down on the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.900 
does is the light shines down on the
fish<00:06:57.600> doesn't<00:06:58.590> shine<00:06:59.070> back<00:06:59.400> on<00:06:59.730> the

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
fish doesn't shine back on the

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.760 
fish doesn't shine back on the
background<00:07:00.360> because<00:07:00.720> you<00:07:00.870> still<00:07:01.170> can<00:07:01.440> wash

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
background because you still can wash

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.040 
background because you still can wash
out<00:07:02.100> or<00:07:02.340> gray<00:07:02.670> out<00:07:02.880> a<00:07:03.120> black<00:07:03.360> background<00:07:03.870> and

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
out or gray out a black background and

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.150 
out or gray out a black background and
black<00:07:04.470> rocks<00:07:04.860> with<00:07:05.190> too<00:07:05.430> much<00:07:05.580> light<00:07:05.990> so<00:07:07.160> yeah

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
black rocks with too much light so yeah

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.700 
black rocks with too much light so yeah
that's<00:07:08.700> pretty<00:07:08.790> much<00:07:09.030> it<00:07:09.180> so<00:07:10.700> TLDR

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
that's pretty much it so TLDR

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.630 
that's pretty much it so TLDR
or<00:07:13.710> a<00:07:13.770> summary<00:07:14.400> of<00:07:14.640> it<00:07:15.530> black<00:07:16.530> rocks<00:07:16.860> black

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.640 
or a summary of it black rocks black

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.390 
or a summary of it black rocks black
background<00:07:18.180> light<00:07:18.960> pull<00:07:19.230> the<00:07:19.380> front<00:07:19.590> dim

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
background light pull the front dim

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.270 
background light pull the front dim
light<00:07:20.700> if<00:07:20.910> you<00:07:21.660> have<00:07:22.050> a<00:07:22.080> six-foot<00:07:22.440> tank<00:07:22.830> you

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
light if you have a six-foot tank you

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.340 
light if you have a six-foot tank you
can<00:07:23.430> have<00:07:23.610> these<00:07:23.790> corners<00:07:24.210> right<00:07:24.360> here<00:07:24.420> I<00:07:24.840> find

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.350 
can have these corners right here I find

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.410 
can have these corners right here I find
it<00:07:25.470> helps<00:07:25.680> with<00:07:25.800> aggression<00:07:26.280> and<00:07:26.460> recovery

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
it helps with aggression and recovery

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.290 
it helps with aggression and recovery
from<00:07:27.930> stress<00:07:28.880> that<00:07:29.880> is<00:07:30.210> pretty<00:07:30.570> much<00:07:30.720> it<00:07:31.190> a

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
from stress that is pretty much it a

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.910 
from stress that is pretty much it a
little<00:07:33.300> update<00:07:33.720> I<00:07:33.900> got<00:07:34.110> three<00:07:34.440> really<00:07:34.680> cool
