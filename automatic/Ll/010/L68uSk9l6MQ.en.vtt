there's<00:00:01.639> okay<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.620> now<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:05.400> gonna<00:00:05.520> show<00:00:05.759> you

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
there's okay so now I'm gonna show you

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.880 
there's okay so now I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.210> cut<00:00:06.899> out<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.200> different<00:00:07.529> fabric

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
how to cut out the different fabric

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.610 
how to cut out the different fabric
using<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.340> patterns<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:08.820> made<00:00:08.970> before<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
using the patterns we made before and I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.930 
using the patterns we made before and I
made<00:00:10.800> some<00:00:11.010> more<00:00:11.130> adjustments<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.759> them

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
made some more adjustments to them

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.580 
made some more adjustments to them
especially<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.690> tail<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> made<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> little

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
especially the tail I made a little

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.129 
especially the tail I made a little
wider<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.190> added<00:00:14.460> some<00:00:14.700> more<00:00:15.179> curves<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.900> some

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
wider and added some more curves to some

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
wider and added some more curves to some
of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> parts<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.730> basically<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.240> just

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
of the parts and here basically you just

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.150 
of the parts and here basically you just
take<00:00:18.690> your<00:00:18.810> pattern<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.500> pin<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> onto<00:00:20.670> fabric

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
take your pattern and pin it onto fabric

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.859 
take your pattern and pin it onto fabric
normally<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> take<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> pattern<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> add<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
normally you take the pattern and add a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.470 
normally you take the pattern and add a
3/8<00:00:25.410> boundary<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.070> outside<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:27.330> on

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
3/8 boundary to the outside just on

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.060 
3/8 boundary to the outside just on
paper<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.930> make<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.199> pattern<00:00:28.500> itself<00:00:28.769> bigger

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
paper and make the pattern itself bigger

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.099 
paper and make the pattern itself bigger
but<00:00:29.789> since<00:00:30.060> there's<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.300> many<00:00:30.390> pieces<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
but since there's so many pieces to this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.420 
but since there's so many pieces to this
and<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.619> big<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.279> been<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and it's really big it would have been a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.250 
and it's really big it would have been a
lot<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> work<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.989> I've<00:00:34.079> done

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
lot of work to do that so what I've done

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
lot of work to do that so what I've done
is<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.440> taking<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.430> 3/8<00:00:35.940> piece<00:00:36.270> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
is just taking a little 3/8 piece of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
is just taking a little 3/8 piece of
paper<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> mark<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.890> use

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
paper with the mark here and just use

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
paper with the mark here and just use
soap<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> mark<00:00:39.030> different<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.629> patch

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
soap to mark different little patch

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.840 
soap to mark different little patch
marks<00:00:40.530> around<00:00:40.649> 3/8<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.730> these

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
marks around 3/8 around all these

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.720 
marks around 3/8 around all these
different<00:00:42.239> pieces<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.800> now<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.550> going

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
different pieces and now I'm just going

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.709 
different pieces and now I'm just going
to<00:00:44.760> cut<00:00:44.969> them<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:47.719> basically

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to cut them up from that and basically

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.330 
to cut them up from that and basically
the<00:00:49.350> reason<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> add<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the reason you need to add this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
the reason you need to add this
three-eighths<00:00:51.000> borders<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.140> have

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
three-eighths borders so you can have

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.130 
three-eighths borders so you can have
some<00:00:52.620> fabric<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> work<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.760> you're

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
some fabric to work with when you're

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
some fabric to work with when you're
using<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.289> sewing<00:00:55.620> machine<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.219> that's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
using your sewing machine and that's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.470 
using your sewing machine and that's
called<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.480> seam<00:00:57.750> allowance<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.699> you<00:00:59.699> can

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
called your seam allowance and you can

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.930 
called your seam allowance and you can
make<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.870> big<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.289> small<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> want

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
make it as big or as small as you want

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.329 
make it as big or as small as you want
obviously<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.719> smaller<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.159> more

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
obviously the smaller you get the more

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
obviously the smaller you get the more
difficult<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.850> gonna<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> work<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.950> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
difficult it's gonna be to work with but

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560 
difficult it's gonna be to work with but
you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.490> finer<00:01:08.729> details<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.420> at

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you can get some finer details like at

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
you can get some finer details like at
the<00:01:09.659> points<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> tips<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.770> tail<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.250> bangs

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the points and tips of tail and bangs

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
the points and tips of tail and bangs
you<00:01:12.210> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.720> close<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.500> don't

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you want to get really close and don't

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
you want to get really close and don't
have<00:01:13.920> almost<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.549> seam<00:01:14.820> allowance<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
have almost no seam allowance and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.590 
have almost no seam allowance and
basically<00:01:16.229> sew<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.650> close<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.390> edge<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
basically sew as close to the edge of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
basically sew as close to the edge of
the<00:01:18.659> fabric<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> really

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the fabric as you can to get the really

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
the fabric as you can to get the really
fine<00:01:20.100> details<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.380> then<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:24.030> method<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
fine details and then this method of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.760 
fine details and then this method of
just<00:01:24.960> adding<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> boundary<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.610> onto<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
just adding the boundary right onto the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
just adding the boundary right onto the
fabric<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.860> used<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.430> Rainbow<00:01:29.790> Dash<00:01:30.000> hair

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
fabric I used with my Rainbow Dash hair

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
fabric I used with my Rainbow Dash hair
because<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.380> complicated

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
because that's also really complicated

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.240 
because that's also really complicated
and<00:01:32.159> had<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> big<00:01:33.119> pieces<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.540> this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
and had a lot of big pieces like this

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
and had a lot of big pieces like this
and<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.939> worked<00:01:36.090> pretty<00:01:36.270> well<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.900> just

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and it worked pretty well so I'm just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.240 
and it worked pretty well so I'm just
gonna<00:01:37.140> replicate<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.009> vinyl

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
gonna replicate it you with vinyl

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.899 
gonna replicate it you with vinyl
scratch<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> when<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:41.610> cutting<00:01:41.729> out

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
scratch and when you're cutting out

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490 
scratch and when you're cutting out
fabric<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> use<00:01:42.540> special<00:01:42.810> scissors<00:01:43.170> like

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
fabric you use special scissors like

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
fabric you use special scissors like
this<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:44.939> for

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this and that's just basically for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.130 
this and that's just basically for
cutting<00:01:45.689> fabric<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:47.149> luckily<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.750> had<00:01:48.930> one

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
cutting fabric and luckily we had one

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
cutting fabric and luckily we had one
one<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> few<00:01:49.590> things<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.890> didn't<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
one of the few things we didn't have to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.690 
one of the few things we didn't have to
bother<00:01:50.630> starting<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:52.020> different

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
bother starting all these different

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
bother starting all these different
rushing<00:01:53.700> projects<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.369> see

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
rushing projects and then as you can see

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.289 
rushing projects and then as you can see
all<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> stuff<00:02:00.149> takes<00:02:00.540> time<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
all this kind of stuff takes time just I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.380 
all this kind of stuff takes time just I
used<00:02:04.020> about<00:02:04.170> another<00:02:04.500> hour<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.950> redesign

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
used about another hour to redesign

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
used about another hour to redesign
these<00:02:06.390> things<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:06.960> more<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:08.340> I've

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
these things just a little more and I've

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.330 
these things just a little more and I've
been<00:02:09.030> spending<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.800> two<00:02:10.800> hours<00:02:11.099> just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
been spending about two hours just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.570 
been spending about two hours just
getting<00:02:11.849> everything<00:02:12.090> set

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
getting everything set

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
getting everything set
peer<00:02:12.850> pitting<00:02:13.590> marking<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.740> soap<00:02:16.260> cutting

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
peer pitting marking of the soap cutting

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.860 
peer pitting marking of the soap cutting
out<00:02:17.670> I've<00:02:18.670> got<00:02:18.880> quite<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.090> few<00:02:19.300> pieces<00:02:19.480> done

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
out I've got quite a few pieces done

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.380 
out I've got quite a few pieces done
already<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.850> cut<00:02:22.060> them<00:02:22.240> out<00:02:22.330> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
already and then as I cut them out I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.730 
already and then as I cut them out I
just<00:02:22.720> put<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:22.990> into<00:02:23.170> place<00:02:23.410> where<00:02:23.590> they

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
just put them into place where they

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.300 
just put them into place where they
belong

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
belong

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.280 
belong
I've<00:02:25.090> everything<00:02:25.540> labeled<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:25.990> don't<00:02:26.170> get

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
I've everything labeled so I don't get

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 
I've everything labeled so I don't get
it<00:02:26.410> mixed<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.800> with<00:02:26.920> anything<00:02:27.190> else<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.900> this

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
it mixed up with anything else like this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.190 
it mixed up with anything else like this
one<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.560> uh<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:31.120> side<00:02:31.330> hair<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:31.930> called

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
one is uh the side hair and it's called

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.910 
one is uh the side hair and it's called
the<00:02:32.290> top<00:02:32.500> middle<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.580> here's<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> side<00:02:34.510> here

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the top middle so here's the side here

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.440 
the top middle so here's the side here
top<00:02:35.920> middle<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.460> right<00:02:36.670> here<00:02:37.030> and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
top middle would go right here and

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.510 
top middle would go right here and
everything<00:02:38.140> kind<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.470> lines<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> matches

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
everything kind of lines up the matches

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.620 
everything kind of lines up the matches
up<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:42.790> there<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.090> can<00:02:43.120> see<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:43.510> these

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
up and from there you can see all these

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
up and from there you can see all these
things<00:02:43.690> starting<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.470> take<00:02:44.680> shape<00:02:44.710> like

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
things starting to take shape like

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.770 
things starting to take shape like
here's<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.460> tail<00:02:45.670> here's<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> top<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
here's the tail here's the top of the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.620 
here's the tail here's the top of the
hair<00:02:46.960> here's<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.800> side<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:49.420> from

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
hair here's the side here then from

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.750 
hair here's the side here then from
there<00:02:49.870> basically<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:51.100> just<00:02:51.130> take<00:02:51.340> two<00:02:51.670> of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
there basically you just take two of

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.190 
there basically you just take two of
these<00:02:51.820> things<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.300> pin<00:02:52.480> them<00:02:52.600> together<00:02:52.810> and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
these things and pin them together and

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.410 
these things and pin them together and
then<00:02:53.290> start<00:02:53.500> sewing<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.220> that's<00:02:55.090> where<00:02:55.300> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
then start sewing and that's where the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.850 
then start sewing and that's where the
real<00:02:55.540> fun<00:02:55.750> begins<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.380> things<00:02:56.530> actually

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
real fun begins and things actually

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.990 
real fun begins and things actually
start<00:02:57.010> taking<00:02:57.720> actual<00:02:58.720> shape<00:02:59.130> so<00:03:00.130> I'm<00:03:00.820> just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
start taking actual shape so I'm just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
start taking actual shape so I'm just
gonna<00:03:01.090> spend<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.420> little<00:03:01.510> more<00:03:01.720> time<00:03:01.959> here

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
gonna spend a little more time here

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.770 
gonna spend a little more time here
cutting<00:03:02.890> everything<00:03:03.100> out<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.880> then

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
cutting everything out and then

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.900 
cutting everything out and then
obviously<00:03:05.500> I'll<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> same<00:03:06.400> process<00:03:06.880> for

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
obviously I'll do the same process for

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.400 
obviously I'll do the same process for
all<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> pieces<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.780> body<00:03:07.959> using<00:03:08.230> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
all the pieces of the body using the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.350 
all the pieces of the body using the
white<00:03:08.620> fabric<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.510> then<00:03:11.310> from<00:03:12.310> there<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.790> think

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
white fabric and then from there I think

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.810 
white fabric and then from there I think
I'll<00:03:13.480> start<00:03:13.690> our<00:03:13.900> next<00:03:14.050> video<00:03:14.640> showing<00:03:15.640> about

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
I'll start our next video showing about

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.640 
I'll start our next video showing about
how<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> pin<00:03:16.390> things<00:03:16.630> together<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.290> sewing

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
how to pin things together for sewing

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.810 
how to pin things together for sewing
and<00:03:17.769> how<00:03:17.890> everything<00:03:18.280> gets<00:03:18.489> oriented

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
and how everything gets oriented

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.940 
and how everything gets oriented
together<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.510> how<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.660> actual<00:03:20.080> sewing

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
together and how the actual sewing

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.390 
together and how the actual sewing
process<00:03:21.519> works<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.560> there's<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.950> next<00:03:24.190> step

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
process works so there's the next step

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.340 
process works so there's the next step
in<00:03:24.640> making<00:03:25.090> plushies<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.900> kind<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.140> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
in making plushies it's kind of the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.199 
in making plushies it's kind of the
mundane<00:03:27.130> stuff<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.730> getting<00:03:28.000> everything

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
mundane stuff just getting everything

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.600 
mundane stuff just getting everything
ready<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.780> once<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.800> get<00:03:29.980> everything<00:03:30.100> cut

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
ready but once you get everything cut

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.970 
ready but once you get everything cut
out<00:03:30.760> then<00:03:31.570> things<00:03:31.930> start<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.380> really<00:03:32.560> get

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
out then things start to really get

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.960 
out then things start to really get
going<00:03:33.310> quickly<00:03:33.550> so<00:03:34.980> that's<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.280> for<00:03:36.489> now

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
going quickly so that's it for now

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:47.510 
going quickly so that's it for now
check<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:38.110> our<00:03:38.200> next<00:03:38.410> video<00:03:38.590> real<00:03:39.340> soon

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.580 

okay<00:03:49.130> welcome<00:03:50.130> back<00:03:50.340> everyone

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
we're moving on to the next stage of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.440 
we're moving on to the next stage of
making<00:03:54.450> our<00:03:54.720> plushies<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:56.030> then<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.180> next

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
making our plushies and then the next

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.480

wasn't here there wouldn't be enough
fabric<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.140> pull<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.590> tight<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.150> if<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.240> don't

pull your fabric tight you get very very
low<00:04:46.020> definition<00:04:46.650> on<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.860> stitching<00:04:47.340> I've<00:04:47.940> had

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
low definition on the stitching I've had

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.900 
low definition on the stitching I've had
mistakes<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.290> few<00:04:49.440> times<00:04:49.710> where<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.760> get

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
mistakes a few times where like you get

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.580 
mistakes a few times where like you get
some<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.300> fabric<00:04:51.540> poking<00:04:52.170> up<00:04:52.290> between

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
some of the fabric poking up between

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.020 
some of the fabric poking up between
here<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:52.770> you'd<00:04:53.010> see<00:04:53.160> like<00:04:53.190> lots<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.640> specks<00:04:53.910> of

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
here so you'd see like lots of specks of

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.030 
here so you'd see like lots of specks of
white<00:04:54.090> hidden<00:04:54.450> between<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.780> black<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.590> then

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
white hidden between the black and then

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.090 
white hidden between the black and then
it<00:04:56.370> doesn't<00:04:56.700> look<00:04:56.730> very<00:04:56.850> good<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:58.100> that's

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
it doesn't look very good and that's

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.770 
it doesn't look very good and that's
mainly<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.700> main<00:04:59.850> detriment<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.510> can<00:05:00.630> see

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
mainly the main detriment you can see

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.890 
mainly the main detriment you can see
it's<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.020> same<00:05:01.050> thing<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.740> excess<00:05:02.640> fabric

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
it's the same thing here excess fabric

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900 
it's the same thing here excess fabric
this<00:05:03.900> also<00:05:04.380> same<00:05:05.310> thing<00:05:05.460> with<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> face

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
this also same thing with the face

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.680 
this also same thing with the face

the head out or on that and get your
desired<00:05:18.150> shape<00:05:18.480> earlier<00:05:19.380> on<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.650> tried<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.980> cut

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
desired shape earlier on we tried to cut

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.650 
desired shape earlier on we tried to cut
the<00:05:20.310> head<00:05:20.490> out<00:05:20.640> first<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.180> then<00:05:21.240> put<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.630> eye

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
the head out first and then put the eye

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.750 
the head out first and then put the eye
on<00:05:21.930> but<00:05:22.080> it's<00:05:22.230> extremely<00:05:22.980> difficult<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.520> get

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
on but it's extremely difficult to get

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.270 
on but it's extremely difficult to get
it<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.030> right<00:05:24.150> position<00:05:24.950> without<00:05:25.950> being

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
it in the right position without being

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.580 
it in the right position without being
able<00:05:26.370> without<00:05:26.790> having<00:05:27.360> something<00:05:27.630> out<00:05:28.350> of

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
able without having something out of

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.320 
able without having something out of
position<00:05:29.040> and<00:05:29.160> then<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.490> have<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.730> scrap<00:05:30.210> the

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
position and then you have to scrap the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.820 
position and then you have to scrap the
whole<00:05:30.420> thing<00:05:31.700> you<00:05:32.700> know<00:05:32.820> this<00:05:33.120> embroidery<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
whole thing you know this embroidery the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.280 
whole thing you know this embroidery the
cutie<00:05:35.100> marks<00:05:35.340> probably<00:05:35.790> take<00:05:35.880> about<00:05:36.290> 20

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
cutie marks probably take about 20

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.170 
cutie marks probably take about 20
minutes<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.770> eyes<00:05:37.860> take<00:05:38.430> about<00:05:38.670> close<00:05:38.970> to

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
minutes and the eyes take about close to

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.500 
minutes and the eyes take about close to
a<00:05:39.210> half<00:05:39.330> hour<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.780> 35<00:05:40.200> minutes<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:42.210> it's<00:05:42.330> quite

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
a half hour to 35 minutes so it's quite

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.020 
a half hour to 35 minutes so it's quite
time-consuming<00:05:43.200> process<00:05:43.890> as<00:05:44.160> well<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.520> you

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
time-consuming process as well and you

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.370 
time-consuming process as well and you
can't<00:05:45.240> speed<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:45.540> up<00:05:45.720> any<00:05:45.930> because<00:05:46.080> it's<00:05:46.230> all

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
can't speed it up any because it's all

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.130 
can't speed it up any because it's all
machine<00:05:46.770> made<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:48.300> here's<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.630> next<00:05:48.870> one<00:05:49.020> in

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
machine made and here's the next one in

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.250 
machine made and here's the next one in
line<00:05:49.170> this<00:05:49.440> will<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.800> second<00:05:50.160> eye

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
line this will be the second eye

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.870 
line this will be the second eye
basically<00:05:52.260> what<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.620> do<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.370> patterns<00:05:53.730> are

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
basically what I do is the patterns are

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.340 
basically what I do is the patterns are
set<00:05:54.060> up<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.300> be<00:05:55.460> displayed<00:05:56.460> in<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:57.050> grid<00:05:58.050> fashion

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
set up to be displayed in a grid fashion

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.090 
set up to be displayed in a grid fashion
and<00:05:58.740> this<00:05:59.040> one's<00:05:59.310> I<00:05:59.790> believe<00:06:00.240> two<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.690> three

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
and this one's I believe two and three

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.650 
and this one's I believe two and three
orders<00:06:01.280> by<00:06:01.460> three<00:06:01.760> and<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:01.910> half<00:06:02.090> inches<00:06:02.420> tall

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
orders by three and a half inches tall

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.780 
orders by three and a half inches tall
so<00:06:03.410> I<00:06:03.470> make<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:03.680> little<00:06:03.860> marker<00:06:04.250> here<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:04.670> that

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:04.790 
so I make a little marker here so that

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.190 
so I make a little marker here so that
can<00:06:04.940> get<00:06:05.090> lined<00:06:05.300> up<00:06:05.480> on<00:06:05.600> the<00:06:05.630> machine<00:06:05.840> real

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
can get lined up on the machine real

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.220 
can get lined up on the machine real
easily<00:06:06.970> just<00:06:07.970> and<00:06:08.150> then<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.780> just<00:06:08.960> gives<00:06:09.110> me

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
easily just and then that just gives me

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.750 
easily just and then that just gives me
an<00:06:09.320> idea<00:06:09.470> about<00:06:09.740> where<00:06:10.040> the<00:06:10.070> eye<00:06:10.220> is<00:06:10.340> gonna<00:06:10.520> be

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
an idea about where the eye is gonna be

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.600 
an idea about where the eye is gonna be
on<00:06:10.910> this<00:06:11.060> fabric<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.800> then<00:06:13.040> basically<00:06:13.370> what

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
on this fabric and then basically what

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.520 
on this fabric and then basically what
you<00:06:13.700> do<00:06:13.910> is<00:06:14.300> we<00:06:14.480> have<00:06:14.570> two<00:06:14.750> pieces<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.260> the<00:06:15.380> hoop

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
you do is we have two pieces to the hoop

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.040 
you do is we have two pieces to the hoop
here<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:16.850> know<00:06:16.970> some<00:06:17.150> sort<00:06:17.360> of<00:06:17.480> backing<00:06:17.930> on<00:06:18.020> it

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
here you know some sort of backing on it

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.690 
here you know some sort of backing on it
to<00:06:18.290> give<00:06:18.410> it<00:06:18.440> some<00:06:18.680> extra<00:06:18.770> strength<00:06:19.250> they<00:06:19.490> put

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
to give it some extra strength they put

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.630 
to give it some extra strength they put
that<00:06:19.850> on<00:06:19.910> there<00:06:20.890> then<00:06:21.890> you'd<00:06:22.040> lay<00:06:22.220> your<00:06:22.400> other

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
that on there then you'd lay your other

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.260 
that on there then you'd lay your other
fabric<00:06:22.880> over<00:06:23.360> on<00:06:23.450> top<00:06:23.600> of<00:06:23.780> that<00:06:24.190> and<00:06:25.190> this<00:06:26.090> is

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
fabric over on top of that and this is

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.270 
fabric over on top of that and this is
just<00:06:26.450> for<00:06:26.600> demonstration<00:06:26.660> I'll<00:06:27.350> do<00:06:27.530> this<00:06:27.680> for

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
just for demonstration I'll do this for

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.210 
just for demonstration I'll do this for
real<00:06:28.430> later<00:06:28.730> on<00:06:28.970> and<00:06:29.960> basically<00:06:30.470> just<00:06:30.950> place

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
real later on and basically just place

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.320 
real later on and basically just place
that<00:06:31.430> over<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.640> top<00:06:31.930> press<00:06:32.930> it<00:06:33.110> down<00:06:33.230> firmly

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
that over the top press it down firmly

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.640 
that over the top press it down firmly
stretch<00:06:35.330> out<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.660> fabric<00:06:35.870> to<00:06:36.200> make<00:06:36.350> sure<00:06:36.530> it

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
stretch out the fabric to make sure it

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.020 
stretch out the fabric to make sure it
gets<00:06:36.770> nice<00:06:37.010> and<00:06:37.040> tight<00:06:37.370> like<00:06:37.400> we<00:06:37.640> discussed

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
gets nice and tight like we discussed

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.680 
gets nice and tight like we discussed
earlier<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:39.160> then<00:06:40.160> from<00:06:40.400> there<00:06:40.610> head<00:06:41.390> on<00:06:41.510> to

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
earlier and then from there head on to

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.370 
earlier and then from there head on to
the<00:06:41.720> machine<00:06:41.980> and<00:06:43.450> let<00:06:44.450> it<00:06:44.570> do<00:06:44.720> its<00:06:44.750> work

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
the machine and let it do its work

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.710 
the machine and let it do its work
you<00:06:45.650> have<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:45.920> do<00:06:46.070> things<00:06:46.340> like<00:06:46.540> lining<00:06:47.540> it<00:06:47.630> up

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
you have to do things like lining it up

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.590 
you have to do things like lining it up
to<00:06:48.080> match<00:06:48.260> this<00:06:49.130> little<00:06:49.520> marker<00:06:50.180> here<00:06:50.360> that<00:06:50.510> we

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
to match this little marker here that we

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.820 
to match this little marker here that we
have<00:06:50.810> and<00:06:51.740> eventually<00:06:53.320> 35<00:06:54.320> minutes<00:06:54.620> later

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
have and eventually 35 minutes later

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.980 
have and eventually 35 minutes later
you'll<00:06:55.790> get<00:06:55.910> your<00:06:56.150> eye<00:06:56.920> so<00:06:58.600> I'm<00:06:59.600> gonna<00:06:59.720> put

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
you'll get your eye so I'm gonna put

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.560 
you'll get your eye so I'm gonna put
this<00:07:00.140> together<00:07:00.560> for<00:07:00.740> real<00:07:01.100> and<00:07:01.520> we'll<00:07:02.360> see

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
this together for real and we'll see

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.850 
this together for real and we'll see
what<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:02.840> Machine<00:07:03.110> looks<00:07:03.140> like<00:07:03.500> when<00:07:03.650> it<00:07:03.740> gets

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
what the Machine looks like when it gets

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.250 
what the Machine looks like when it gets
working
