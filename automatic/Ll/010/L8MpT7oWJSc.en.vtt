00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.039 
this weekend will have 48 hours I think
of<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.049> baking<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:48.049> Monday

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
of a little more baking and then Monday

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
of a little more baking and then Monday
brings<00:01:49.590> relief<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.850> after<00:01:51.390> monday

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
brings relief and actually after monday

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
brings relief and actually after monday
next<00:01:52.470> week<00:01:52.710> should<00:01:53.520> produce<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.119> serious

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
next week should produce a serious

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
next week should produce a serious
cooling<00:01:55.380> trend<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> temperatures<00:01:56.340> by

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
cooling trend and temperatures by

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
cooling trend and temperatures by
mid-week<00:01:57.299> probably<00:01:57.990> dip<00:01:58.259> below<00:01:58.530> average<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mid-week probably dip below average so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
mid-week probably dip below average so
it's<00:01:59.490> very<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.570> interesting<00:02:01.110> after<00:02:01.380> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
