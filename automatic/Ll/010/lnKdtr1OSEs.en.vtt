00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 Rasmus and only 7 acres of the vineyard 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 Vladimir and Olga 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 grow from childhood 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 Vladimir Vasilyevich comes from Rostov 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 Orsk city 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.820
 where we have royal steppes and large 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.969
 great vineyards here from that time I 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.489
 loved the grapes and saw him 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.129
 grown as they are courted by a wife 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 Olga did not immediately support normal 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.450
 people plant potatoes tomatoes cucumbers you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
 here I occupy all the space somehow 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.430
 bushes of grapes but i don't believe it at all 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 really the project is not easy 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.629
 growing grapes and testing 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.949
 The newest varieties of domestic and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.500
 foreign breeders 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.140
 systematically began to engage in 2007 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 15-20 new ones added each year 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.880
 seedlings and now they have on site 140 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 bushes here we are here solo 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 grape growers testers in dace not 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 Boasting we can from one kidney 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 sapling will grow is very large 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.400
 labor is worth what labor is worth 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.619
 it can be seen on the site all exactly neatly 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 tracks under the tile varieties are painted 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.939
 work from spring to autumn 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.070
 but the result is worth it there are two ways 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.350
 grape garter Vladimir chose 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.670
 faithful with him each breast gets 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 more sunshine 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.220
 vine is whether it is too 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 can reach in the valley a few 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.329
 tens of meters means porn 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 so we put in its path 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.090
 corresponding trellis to her 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.130
 developed by 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.700
 as we want them as she wants 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 that is, we tame her to that Ursa 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.530
 the condition in which it should grow 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.009
 experts know in our region for 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.719
 maturation needs up to 2800 solar 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 hours in exactly this dimension 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.689
 grower consider the solar time in 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.060
 for hours 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.310
 and the sun is the main factor for growing 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.000
 varieties of vines that we grow here 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.460
 they are divided from 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.590
 the morning of early doran is not average more 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.380
 late varieties we do not grow because 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.080
 what they need more more solar 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 days that we lack but have enough 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.820
 patience skill skills and of course love 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 the vine 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.610
 grapes are what man feels 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.570
 attitude towards himself he reacts to everything and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.650
 on the soil and reacts to the climate 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.530
 outdoor air conditions and mean on 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.550
 various changes on water and on 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.070
 relations 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.350
 it is necessary to grow a little more still to keep the vine 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.480
 winter is generally present 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.270
 art Olga is now also carried away 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 has created a pizza grape site communicates with 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.070
 those who expressed a desire to do 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.780
 viticulture before we communicate that I help 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.060
 if they have any questions there 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.040
 they are asking 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.680
 here I share information on the site 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.850
 on ours and classmates we are there very 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.980
 I have a lot of friends, and here you are 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.160
 what was there big collections like us 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.049
 but I think probably not if Vladimir 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.400
 responsible for the process of growing the pelvis 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.340
 harvest is taken Olga 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.330
 the grape is supplied to the whole big family 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.640
 valerianov and still participate 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.000
 trade fairs making raisins 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.850
 juices benefit product cleanest doctors 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.950
 my ecological way i chemistry we 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.980
 practically not using only the most 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.410
 the beginning is just like a loach here earlier 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.540
 earlier in spring and already in June we are no longer 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.030
 apply chemicals i use only 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.420
 eco products you now feel 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.680
 how was your spouse wise 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.590
 I admit my mistake should have been earlier 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.390
 start and planted a little more vladimir 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.910
 Vasilyev says science does not stand still 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.340
 I want to constantly try new varieties 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.500
 and then came the law on private winemaking 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 this is a new interesting task to grow 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.750
 technical grapes 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.269
 we planted 10 varieties of new grape 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 with whom we are thinking of getting wine stuff 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.430
 for wine production we have now 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.849
 universal grape varieties which 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.410
 could be used for both food and 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.290
 wine production and now we already 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.840
 move on 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.820
 it is completely wine grapes 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.010
 since we are Russian for duck 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.780
 Legally allows it to do and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.940
 I will call friends 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.940
 love your heart mood 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.880
 otherwise why would 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.800
