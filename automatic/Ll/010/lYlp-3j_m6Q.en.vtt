 video blog went on last 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.230
 Monday, December 9th update released 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.660
 204 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 we have a little finalized the system of friends 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 now you see on which server your 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.160
 each regardless of whether or not to fight about 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 invitation to battle unavailable to the addressee 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 by rank 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.809
 now do not send generally stay with 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.180
 friends in touch has become more convenient and easier 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 hello everyone cheers last week came out 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 long-awaited new physics that you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.710
 of course already tried along with 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 by physics we brought out some more important 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 updates new physics has become important 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 step in the development of the game not only by itself 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.190
 to myself 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 some depended some more serious 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 updates that we could not display 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 earlier but now we can along with 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.820
 physics this week came new 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.679
 anti-cheat system 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 detailed work on it i struggle with 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.500
 cheaters at all we told 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.300
 special subject edition 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.440
 vlog new anti-cheat allowed 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.700
 close most potential 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.429
 vulnerabilities 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.899
 cheaters but also do not sit idle and 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.190
 coming up with new and new ways 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.380
 circumvent protection 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.810
 now it will be given straight 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 harder and harder one more unnoticed and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.810
 but the most important update 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.940
 optimization of traffic exchange between 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.679
 server and client traffic 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.030
 the exchange will be reduced accordingly 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.630
 data will occur somewhat 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.369
 faster 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.349
 the main point is a noticeable decrease 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 server load and so also 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.869
 increase the stability of their work except 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 addition we will update soon 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.979
 several sets of weapons in the garage 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.080
 words about it from our analyst 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 Eugene Gilmanova as we promised 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.530
 a set of weapons will be periodically 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.300
 We will be updated to choose the most 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.489
 unpopular and replace them with new ones 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.039
 some kits consist immediately of 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:01.050
 several hulls and guns so for example 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.360
 in the starter kit for beginners 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.340
 there are three corps and three guns 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.660
 discount for such kits can 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.270
 reach 80 percent 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.830
 in the new year with new e-sports in the field 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 professional tank battles 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.270
 large-scale reforms are underway 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.920
 the whole system is processed 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.490
 will become e-sports in tanks online 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.070
 find out right now starting in 2014 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.810
 clans will be divided into four see 4 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.510
 league for players with low ranks and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.430
 weapons m 2 3 for high ranked 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 tank crews with top guns and hulls 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.760
 the transition from the fourth division in 3 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.480
 happens automatically upon reaching 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.820
 high ranks 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 all players clans create clans 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.600
 these two leagues free in the second league 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 professional e-sports begins 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.020
 here are experienced and strong clans of them 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.360
 number limited to thirty two 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.310
 the strongest passes above the weakest 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.290
 go to the third league last 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.300

 overcome the ferret force jumps on 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.330
 the roof of the mammoth and leads the year right from under 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.010
 nose 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.020
 question of the week last time two can 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.910

 rails a little late with a shot a 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.070
 fast jump jumper dropped on him 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.180
 Mine meet the winners today 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.180
