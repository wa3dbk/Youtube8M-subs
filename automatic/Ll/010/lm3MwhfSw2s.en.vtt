 welcome to this new column 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.660
 of amina dead the football consultant who 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 will be interested today in younes 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700
 kabul united this player who is all full 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 talent that has just signed with the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 girondins de bordeaux is only 18 years old 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.170
 has just signed with the Girondins of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 burgundy in pro nice reward after 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.939
 many years of effort and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 work and serious 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.670
 today this player we come back that there 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.859
 that it is a very very good template of 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 the more he knows how to use them in when 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.870
 challengers nothing they engage but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.879
 physical intensity so he plays well 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.649
 he plays his game well he is really 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 equal to itself 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.570
 now it's a player who has 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 a lot of who knows how to keep the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.170
 balloon that protects the balloon and the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.180
 quality to keep the ball 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 present on the intervals yes he likes 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 pick up well and be placed between 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
 lines is also but it's not that to be 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.489
 present in the intervals that's 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 anyone I'm going to say could the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.379
 do the most intelligent know how 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.990
 open how to break the lines of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.610
 the opponent how to put the position 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 of his perfect body to play the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 balloon that's very very important of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 tiny details that for some 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.030
 may sound silly but are very 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030
 very 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.710
 very well we'll say they can 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.220
 add more I have not found any 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.289
 the world excuse me now he knows 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.000
 how to leave the small perimeter to 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.039
 open the lines as I said he has 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.490
 a good strike 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.330
 he likes to do transversals 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 change 2.2 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.720
 two that we changed on both sides 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.520
 like to engage with the challenges 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.500
 as never said now he evolves 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.380
 with the managers dan bourdeau me I the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.050
 am because I watch the matches of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.590
 gÃ©randale tv girondins de bordeaux 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.890
 sorry on girondinstv and it's a 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.600
 worthwhile player 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.580
 it's now I'm watching 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.340
 the reserve is playing and I can see they 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 wanted with a system of 4 2 3 1 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.569
 if I'm wrong at 8 4 2 3 1 and he plays 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.730
 as far as crazy wingman on the left side 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.940
 I think it's not got the position 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.150
 which fits him better now 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.760
 the argument that goes that will tell me again 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.500
 to face what I say is yes 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.000
 but he percussive qualities 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 I hear that he has qualities 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.220
 techniques but percussion yes that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.920
 could be and could evolve as much 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.450
 that number 10 maybe I'm going to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.370
 angry with the reserve coach 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.940
 but that's just a simple opinion and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.010
 this is only a humble opinion here it is 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.360
 could evolve as much as number 10 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.310
 to be an accelerator in 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.720
 offensive midfield in the last 35 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 m he could also find himself 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.569
 in a winger's position after a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.750
 change of placement during a 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.780
 action a combination yes at the base 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 it's not years and I'll tell you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.269
 something towards ati or if he has any 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.840
 percussion qualities 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:14.200
 is that so far seen or play 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.850
 as winger this is for me this 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.829
 Winger position is because he goes there 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:24.100
 better and it could be a 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:26.350
 secondary solution or even 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.739
 even we could fight without passing 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.630
 what 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.870
 he is a player who could evolve 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.609
 as many as number eight numbers 10 euros 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.739
 ie number 8 is the relay 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.430
 he reminds me a lot 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.350
 Clement loft here I hope too 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.700
 I had proposed to our federation 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.570
 Royal Moroccan Football 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.570
 2 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.380
 play with a system of 4 3 2 1 with 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.810
 all that entails 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.390
 technicians will sell us 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.850
 understand and I could I could 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.810
 say that this player 3 integrate it into the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.240
 future in this system that's it then I do not 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.960
 control nothing at all I know I do not 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.820
 can not do anything 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.770
 he could also walk in others 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.050
 systems like 4-2-3-1 there or there as 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.420
 Bordeaux or even the 4-3-3 as he can 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.859
 play relay hemorrhoids here 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.290
 today in the liver we see it in 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.670
 a position of homes elsewhere 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.290
 wingmen it's not me who says it's 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.130
 arsene wenger there is less and less 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.930
 in modern football 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.370
 and when there is only happiness but 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.460
 it does not mean that it does not take anything away 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.320
 to the qualities of nesc abdouni who has everything 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.880
 to win and he has nothing to lose 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.850
 the next step is what these win 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.140
 with those who pass it is possible with 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.400
 much more rigor 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.950
 i just remember bordeaux he was 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.510
 deceived on a player it was sertic who 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.130
 was not really and who was 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.210
 turned into a relay runner and that's where he 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.210
 was able to express himself best 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.520
 so I think younes kaboul y it's 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.080
 the same thing 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 here I hope that this chronicle you 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.020
 liked it if you were with the consultant 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.020
 amina football dead thank you and see you soon
