00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
here and what it's going to do is allow

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
here and what it's going to do is allow
me<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.960> find<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.500> spots<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.189> exactly

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
me to find these spots and know exactly

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
me to find these spots and know exactly
where<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> start<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.330> here's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> thing

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
where to start because here's the thing

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
where to start because here's the thing
the<00:01:10.409> first<00:01:10.619> fish<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> day<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.580> often<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the first fish of the day is often the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
the first fish of the day is often the
most<00:01:12.270> important<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.020> here's<00:01:13.200> why

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
most important one and here's why

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.070 
most important one and here's why
once<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.850> deep<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.540> fish<00:01:15.869> are

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
once we know how deep these fish are

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
once we know how deep these fish are
what<00:01:16.650> type<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> structure<00:01:17.369> they're<00:01:17.549> sitting

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
what type of structure they're sitting

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330 
what type of structure they're sitting
on<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:19.979> find

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
on we can then go back and we can find

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.620 
on we can then go back and we can find
more<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:20.700> spots<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> other

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
more of those spots that's the other

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
more of those spots that's the other
thing<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.080> cool<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.470> smart

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
thing that's really cool about smart

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
thing that's really cool about smart
strike<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.700> allows<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:25.049> back

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
strike it allows me to then go back

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
strike it allows me to then go back
after<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> catch<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.100> couple<00:01:26.220> fish<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.850> narrow

after I catch a couple fish and narrow

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
after I catch a couple fish and narrow
down<00:01:27.689> those<00:01:27.960> parameters<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.740> when<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
down those parameters so when I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
down those parameters so when I
identified<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:29.909> fish<00:01:30.150> may<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> 13

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
identified that these fish may be in 13

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.030 
identified that these fish may be in 13
to<00:01:31.229> 15<00:01:31.619> feet

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to 15 feet

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.730 
to 15 feet
I<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:32.880> narrow<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.930> write<00:01:34.500> on

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
I can now narrow this down and write on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.569 
I can now narrow this down and write on
my<00:01:35.009> GPS<00:01:35.430> map<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> lay<00:01:37.170> down

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
my GPS map it's going to lay down

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.740 
my GPS map it's going to lay down
highlighted<00:01:38.579> areas<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.540> over

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
highlighted areas and that's right over

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
highlighted areas and that's right over
that<00:01:39.780> Lake<00:01:40.049> master<00:01:40.380> map<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:40.950> easy

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that Lake master map so it's really easy

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
that Lake master map so it's really easy
I<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> drive<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.689> drop

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I can just drive right to them I drop

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810 
I can just drive right to them I drop
the<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:43.470> down<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.009> fishing<00:01:44.220> let<00:01:44.759> me

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
