he does it is different then it's a lot

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.760 
he does it is different then it's a lot
more<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.869> way<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.110> Tony<00:01:42.350> does<00:01:42.470> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
more like the way that Tony does it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.130 
more like the way that Tony does it
versus<00:01:43.070> someone<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.490> me<00:01:43.640> or<00:01:43.670> flow<00:01:44.149> or<00:01:44.390> Cesar

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
versus someone like me or flow or Cesar

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.230 
versus someone like me or flow or Cesar
there<00:01:45.770> he<00:01:45.920> doesn't<00:01:46.190> last<00:01:46.369> 50<00:01:46.729> meters<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.180> were

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the pressure what's he trying to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.860 
the pressure what's he trying to
accomplish<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:25.160> season<00:02:25.610> at<00:02:25.850> afros<00:02:26.150> Wayne<00:02:26.390> like

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
accomplish in season at afros Wayne like

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
think that's probably what everybody

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.030 
think that's probably what everybody
kind<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.130> feels<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:38.300> know<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.390> know<00:02:38.480> for
