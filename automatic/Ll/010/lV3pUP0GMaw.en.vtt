00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.350
 in the packs frankly people we 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.699

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.570
 Fault Ultimate Team Brazil Rest 2h18 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.090
 we will open the first the first I the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.130
 watched his parties the guards 35000 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.570
 credit the biggest packs ever 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.399
 created so that's the same as the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.049
 liver the same who offered us even son 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.299
 is this one going to us? 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.219
 to offer heavy even at not a robben 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.840
 but if all that would be enough for me 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.219
 I would be really happy with that 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.219
 Well, we'll see the first one I'm going to 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.749
 watch and we shoppe drogba so the 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.200
 first is pretty rotten 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.600
 unfortunately hernandez 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.950
 is rotten in those two have not 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 free is already pretty good 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.200
 aurier who is no longer who is no longer 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.969
 handcuffed is unfortunately good the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.469
 first is rotten it's okay we're going 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.909
 hope that the second is the 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:54.179
 second who had given us the other 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.229
 times the end the 2 pay in july noted m 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.450
 I think there is nothing interesting 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.729
 behind I will still keep the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 cards the post modifier i'm going 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.000
 keep fit team and the rest that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.250
 I'm interested in what contracts I 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.720
 am armored so for the end of that 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 will do it widely 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.620
 and that's so beautiful lawn movie 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.020
 the one from below landreau we will clear 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.430
 all that was going to rest us two am 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.740
 I will not look at it like with 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.750
 two countries were going please if he 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.280
 please please go here we go 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.760
 I believe in it I believe in it 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.020
 go I do not look I would like to see 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.850
 in the duplicates too but in my opinion 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.270
 in the duplicates daddy pick of the very 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.210
 very heavy first and I'm not watching 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.160
 here it is what pays so there I see 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.070
 contracts I want contracts to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.480
 to play rodriguez suarez but it is not 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.370
 good 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.940
 at di maria i saw di maria i think 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 not that we have better 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.240
 yeah it's not bad having yielded 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.600
 japan and di maria in my opinion we do not have 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.880
 occurred 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.370
 we will see in the duplicates are not 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.860
 robben have unfortunately to you his 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 name robben he is he and vermont that if 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.090
 I had if I had had to steal robben 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.590
 would have been the green so too bad for 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.330
 that we still had di maria I know 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.540
 not how much ivo saw that he made a cut 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.910
 of the world not too bad 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500
 maybe 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.960
 maybe he wants some 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.420
 thing but but the version version 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.880
 middle right I do not think so much and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.020
 20000 17000 yeah that's not bad 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.810
 it's still not 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.820
 wrong is still not bad the package to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.850
 half refund we'll say as I see 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.290
 go throw 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.030
 that's a little more than half 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.800
 so that's pretty good 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.270
 we will put him in the spotlight of transfers 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.220
 the rest is not really interesting 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.830
 michael ciani and where we have one left 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.080
 we have one left so go the clos de 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.150
 the closer it is for for the last 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.520
 not that I feel it well 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.770
 will we believed it believes it must 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.550
 believe anyway I refresh a 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.410
 little bit the shop 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.390
 even if we have a free pack also there 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.860
 open them I will open the not free 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.320
 and then after we open it last 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.690
 pack to 35000 tracings must believe if 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.300
 you do not believe it in anything go this 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.030
 who can give us a correct player 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.010
 there the free paka paka to 5000 credit in 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930
 general there is not much the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.230
 packs of the future cup it's a bit like that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.970
 as well 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.680
 yeah here we welcome put the credit 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.530
 even when you have 1000 credits and david 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.660
 in duplicate so it's pretty good 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.750
 finally a pretty good pack with 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.570
 a nice yellow jersey it makes think the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.220
 Tour de France obviously gilded to my 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.870
 reviews are not going much so we're going 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.940
 buy his rise before we still 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.130
 recovered 2000 credit on this pack which 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.390
 is rather pretty correct and so we're going 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.760
 finish them off with the last ones guys this is 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.030
 left that one is the same I'm going to 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.280

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.350
 I will let him discover himself but I 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.760
 do not go watch it and we'll see we're going 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.950
 see what we can what we can catch 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.140
 in there are still 30 cards the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.400
 18 rare therefore on the eighteen rare and 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.350
 can still give something 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.430
 friendly and I'm not looking 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.920
