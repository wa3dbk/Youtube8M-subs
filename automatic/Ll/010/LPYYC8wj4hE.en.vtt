00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
some of that sort maybe without the

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.380 
some of that sort maybe without the
American<00:06:09.870> part<00:06:10.110> but<00:06:10.400> you<00:06:11.400> know<00:06:11.520> I<00:06:11.550> can<00:06:12.030> I<00:06:12.210> can

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
American part but you know I can I can

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.050 
American part but you know I can I can
take<00:06:12.630> from<00:06:12.810> that<00:06:12.990> I<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:14.310> see<00:06:14.550> what's<00:06:14.729> going<00:06:14.789> on

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
take from that I can see what's going on

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.600 
take from that I can see what's going on
I<00:06:15.270> can<00:06:15.419> see<00:06:15.600> how<00:06:15.780> they<00:06:15.930> did<00:06:16.140> it<00:06:16.260> and<00:06:16.350> I<00:06:16.860> can<00:06:17.130> be

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
I can see how they did it and I can be

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.450 
I can see how they did it and I can be
fully<00:06:17.970> rested<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.630> probably<00:06:19.530> not<00:06:20.190> have<00:06:20.340> to

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
fully rested and probably not have to

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.310 
fully rested and probably not have to
deal<00:06:20.640> with<00:06:20.669> a<00:06:20.880> lot<00:06:21.060> of<00:06:21.090> bugs<00:06:21.450> that<00:06:21.870> they<00:06:22.110> have

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
deal with a lot of bugs that they have

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.300 
deal with a lot of bugs that they have
to<00:06:22.440> deal<00:06:22.650> with<00:06:23.120> so<00:06:24.289> obviously<00:06:25.289> my<00:06:25.710> strategy<00:06:26.250> is

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
to deal with so obviously my strategy is

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.890 
to deal with so obviously my strategy is
a<00:06:26.400> little<00:06:26.580> bit<00:06:26.669> more<00:06:26.820> complex<00:06:27.240> than<00:06:27.390> that<00:06:27.510> I

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
a little bit more complex than that I

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.659 
a little bit more complex than that I
don't<00:06:28.440> have<00:06:28.590> very<00:06:28.620> high<00:06:29.070> hopes<00:06:29.280> for<00:06:29.460> the

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
don't have very high hopes for the

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.750 
don't have very high hopes for the
leveling<00:06:30.090> run<00:06:30.270> but<00:06:31.110> I<00:06:31.380> do<00:06:31.710> feel<00:06:32.100> I'm<00:06:32.280> going<00:06:32.610> to

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
leveling run but I do feel I'm going to

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.080 
leveling run but I do feel I'm going to
have<00:06:33.000> a<00:06:33.300> small<00:06:34.229> opportunity<00:06:34.950> to<00:06:35.520> gain<00:06:35.700> a<00:06:35.760> lot

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
have a small opportunity to gain a lot

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.300 
have a small opportunity to gain a lot
of<00:06:36.150> information<00:06:36.479> from<00:06:36.990> a<00:06:37.169> lot<00:06:37.200> of<00:06:37.470> people

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
of information from a lot of people

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.400 
of information from a lot of people
that<00:06:38.640> many<00:06:39.090> others<00:06:39.630> would<00:06:39.990> have<00:06:40.050> otherwise

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
that many others would have otherwise

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.950 
that many others would have otherwise
missed<00:06:40.890> and<00:06:41.220> in<00:06:41.790> some<00:06:42.000> cases<00:06:42.240> would<00:06:42.660> have<00:06:42.780> just

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
missed and in some cases would have just

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.030 
missed and in some cases would have just
felt<00:06:43.200> really<00:06:43.380> angry<00:06:43.650> about<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:44.010> whole
