Natural Resources resources are what we

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.209 
Natural Resources resources are what we

earth<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.240> our<00:00:15.450> resources<00:00:15.960> from<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
earth we get our resources from the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500 
earth we get our resources from the
earth<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.220> call<00:00:17.460> those<00:00:17.699> natural

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
earth and we call those natural

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
earth and we call those natural
resources<00:00:19.039> there's<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> different

types of natural resources it could be

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
types of natural resources it could be

metals energy plants animals and all of
this<00:00:32.399> we're<00:00:32.640> getting<00:00:32.969> from<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:33.770> environment

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this we're getting from our environment

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
this we're getting from our environment
and<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.010> could<00:00:35.700> break<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> those<00:00:36.480> natural

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and we could break all of those natural

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
and we could break all of those natural
resources<00:00:36.960> into<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.129> types<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.030> what

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
resources into two types we have what

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260 
resources into two types we have what
are<00:00:39.600> called<00:00:39.629> renewable<00:00:40.559> resources<00:00:41.430> winds<00:00:42.000> an

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
are called renewable resources winds an

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
are called renewable resources winds an
example<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> energy<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.710> renewable<00:00:44.399> as

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
example of energy that's renewable as

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.910 
example of energy that's renewable as
the<00:00:45.120> Sun<00:00:45.360> shines<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> earth<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.739> air

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the Sun shines on the earth the air

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
the Sun shines on the earth the air
starts<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> move<00:00:47.520> around<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.420> we're<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
starts to move around and we're going to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.250 
starts to move around and we're going to
be<00:00:49.110> able<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> generate<00:00:49.559> energy<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
be able to generate energy from that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.450 
be able to generate energy from that
non-renewable<00:00:52.260> resources<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:53.039> resources

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
non-renewable resources our resources

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
non-renewable resources our resources
that<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:54.000> come<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.360> within<00:00:54.690> our<00:00:54.930> lifetime

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that don't come back within our lifetime

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
that don't come back within our lifetime
and<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.949> oil<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.730> example<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.480> oil

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and so oil is an example of that oil

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.770 
and so oil is an example of that oil
contains<00:00:58.680> energy<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.820> stored<00:00:59.850> millions

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
contains energy that was stored millions

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900 
contains energy that was stored millions
of<00:01:00.960> years<00:01:01.170> ago<00:01:01.320> from<00:01:01.680> ancient<00:01:01.920> rain<00:01:02.370> forests

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of years ago from ancient rain forests

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
of years ago from ancient rain forests
and<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.300> use<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.470> gone<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.129> not

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and if we use that up it's gone it's not

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
and if we use that up it's gone it's not
going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> come<00:01:05.670> back<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.030> least<00:01:06.240> within<00:01:06.450> our

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
lifetime another thing you should

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
lifetime another thing you should
understand<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.270> natural<00:01:09.810> resources<00:01:10.439> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
understand about natural resources is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.899 
understand about natural resources is
that<00:01:10.830> they're<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.100> uniformly<00:01:11.790> distributed

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that they're not uniformly distributed

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
that they're not uniformly distributed
on<00:01:12.659> our<00:01:12.810> planet<00:01:13.110> they're<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.920> mixed

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
on our planet they're going to be mixed

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.850 
on our planet they're going to be mixed
up<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> where<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.600> humans<00:01:15.630> live<00:01:16.350> we're

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
up and so where do humans live we're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340 
up and so where do humans live we're
living<00:01:17.310> where<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.509> many<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
living where we can get as many of the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
living where we can get as many of the
resources<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.430> possibly<00:01:20.700> find<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.840> we're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
resources we can possibly find but we're

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.060 
resources we can possibly find but we're
not<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.920> resources

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
not going to have all the resources

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
not going to have all the resources
there<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
there and so if you look at the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
there and so if you look at the
distribution<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.860> humans<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.430> our<00:01:26.580> planet

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
distribution of humans on our planet

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
distribution of humans on our planet
we're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> find<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:28.110> finding

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
we're going to find that we're finding

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
we're going to find that we're finding
that<00:01:29.070> we're<00:01:29.220> living<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.670> areas<00:01:30.000> where<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> can

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that we're living in areas where you can

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
that we're living in areas where you can
get<00:01:30.450> enough<00:01:30.659> food<00:01:30.930> enough<00:01:31.320> water<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.460> we

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
get enough food enough water but we

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
get enough food enough water but we
don't<00:01:32.759> get<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> our<00:01:33.360> resources<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.020> we

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
don't get all of our resources so we

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.569 
don't get all of our resources so we
have<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> trade<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> ship<00:01:35.369> those

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
have to kind of trade and ship those

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.910 
have to kind of trade and ship those
around<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.030> our<00:01:36.060> planet<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.350> map<00:01:37.650> right<00:01:37.860> here

call<00:01:47.280> those<00:01:47.399> mega<00:01:47.820> cities<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:49.200> we're

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
call those mega cities and what we're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
call those mega cities and what we're
finding<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.329> more

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
finding is that as you get more and more

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
finding is that as you get more and more
people<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.470> our<00:01:52.770> planet<00:01:53.040> they're<00:01:53.520> requiring

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
people on our planet they're requiring

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.569 
people on our planet they're requiring
more<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.720> resources<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.399> have

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
more and more resources and so we have

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
more and more resources and so we have
to<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:56.939> balance<00:01:57.329> our<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to really balance our use of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
to really balance our use of
non-renewable<00:01:59.729> resources<00:02:00.500> especially<00:02:01.500> if

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
non-renewable resources especially if

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
non-renewable resources especially if
they<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.250> detrimental<00:02:02.880> costs<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
they have some detrimental costs and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.709 
they have some detrimental costs and
thinking<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.829> fossil<00:02:05.729> fuels<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.390> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
thinking of that fossil fuels are really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.830 
thinking of that fossil fuels are really
driving<00:02:07.140> economies<00:02:08.069> right<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.520> coal<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.629> oil

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
driving economies right now coal and oil

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.420 
driving economies right now coal and oil
and<00:02:10.379> what's<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.280> benefit<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and what's the benefit of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.970 
and what's the benefit of
coal<00:02:12.579> and<00:02:12.909> oil<00:02:13.120> they're<00:02:13.629> relatively<00:02:14.140> cheap<00:02:14.379> we

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
coal and oil they're relatively cheap we

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.849 
coal and oil they're relatively cheap we
stored<00:02:15.340> energy<00:02:15.609> a<00:02:16.090> long<00:02:16.359> time<00:02:16.689> ago<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.349> now<00:02:17.799> we

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
stored energy a long time ago and now we

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.580 
stored energy a long time ago and now we
can<00:02:18.069> kind<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.370> cash<00:02:18.579> in<00:02:18.879> on<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.989> problem

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
can kind of cash in on that the problem

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
can kind of cash in on that the problem
is<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.129> costs<00:02:21.730> associated<00:02:22.299> with

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
is that we have costs associated with

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.929 
is that we have costs associated with
non-renewable<00:02:23.349> resources<00:02:23.890> number<00:02:24.730> one

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
non-renewable resources number one

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.819 
non-renewable resources number one
they're<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.719> to<00:02:25.780> last<00:02:25.959> forever<00:02:26.290> and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
they're not going to last forever and

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.580 
they're not going to last forever and
number<00:02:27.489> two<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.450> them<00:02:28.629> have<00:02:28.930> unintended

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
number two a lot of them have unintended

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160 
number two a lot of them have unintended
consequences<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.909> we<00:02:31.090> burn<00:02:31.329> fossil<00:02:31.359> fuels

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
consequences as we burn fossil fuels

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.020 
consequences as we burn fossil fuels
we're<00:02:32.530> putting<00:02:32.829> greenhouse<00:02:33.250> gases<00:02:33.730> into<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
we're putting greenhouse gases into the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
we're putting greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.719> that<00:02:35.290> over<00:02:35.620> time<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:36.040> going

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
atmosphere and that over time is going

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.679 
atmosphere and that over time is going
to<00:02:36.280> increase<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.909> temperature<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.569> then

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
to increase the temperature and then

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.059 
to increase the temperature and then
we're<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.989> have<00:02:38.109> costs<00:02:38.560> associated

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
we're going to have costs associated

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.640 
we're going to have costs associated
with<00:02:39.219> that<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.450> what<00:02:40.599> we're<00:02:40.750> seeing<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.379> a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
with that and so what we're seeing is a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.030 
with that and so what we're seeing is a
switch<00:02:42.189> from<00:02:42.659> non-renewable<00:02:43.659> to<00:02:44.290> renewable

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
switch from non-renewable to renewable

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.770 
switch from non-renewable to renewable
resources<00:02:45.609> and<00:02:45.909> that's<00:02:46.030> being<00:02:46.239> driven<00:02:46.510> by<00:02:46.720> two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
resources and that's being driven by two

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.770 
resources and that's being driven by two
things<00:02:46.989> number<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.859> is<00:02:48.129> technology<00:02:48.780> solar

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
things number one is technology solar

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.440 
things number one is technology solar
energy<00:02:50.290> wasn't<00:02:50.739> very<00:02:51.280> effective<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.329> was

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
energy wasn't very effective and it was

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.349 
energy wasn't very effective and it was
really<00:02:52.840> expensive<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.459> decades<00:02:55.000> ago

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
really expensive you know decades ago

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.970 
really expensive you know decades ago
but<00:02:55.629> that's<00:02:55.810> changing<00:02:56.439> really<00:02:56.680> really

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
but that's changing really really

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.520 
but that's changing really really
quickly<00:02:57.219> and<00:02:57.579> things<00:02:58.299> like<00:02:58.530> geothermal

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
quickly and things like geothermal

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.699 
quickly and things like geothermal
hydroelectric

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
hydroelectric

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.399 
hydroelectric
wind<00:03:02.709> generation<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.540> generating<00:03:05.139> more

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
wind generation is is generating more

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.949 
wind generation is is generating more
energy<00:03:05.469> and<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.849> more<00:03:07.060> valuable<00:03:07.299> resource

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
energy and it's a more valuable resource

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.379 
energy and it's a more valuable resource
and<00:03:08.169> it<00:03:08.230> will<00:03:08.379> be<00:03:08.530> over<00:03:08.889> time<00:03:09.099> we'll<00:03:09.849> also<00:03:10.209> have

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
and it will be over time we'll also have

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.509 
and it will be over time we'll also have
to<00:03:10.540> use<00:03:10.569> regulations<00:03:11.469> in<00:03:11.799> other<00:03:11.950> words<00:03:12.219> when

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
to use regulations in other words when

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.709 
to use regulations in other words when
you<00:03:12.609> put<00:03:12.849> things<00:03:13.120> into<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> atmosphere

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
you put things into the atmosphere

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.020 
you put things into the atmosphere
you're<00:03:14.560> not<00:03:14.739> really<00:03:14.950> being<00:03:15.189> penalized<00:03:15.579> for

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
you're not really being penalized for

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.789 
you're not really being penalized for
that<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.840> putting<00:03:17.139> carbon<00:03:17.560> into<00:03:17.769> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
that you're putting carbon into the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.960 
that you're putting carbon into the
atmosphere<00:03:17.889> it's<00:03:18.459> going<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.639> have<00:03:18.790> some

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
atmosphere it's going to have some

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.580 
atmosphere it's going to have some
unintended<00:03:19.510> consequences<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.560> future

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
unintended consequences in the future

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.289 
unintended consequences in the future
and<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.340> we'll<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.849> use<00:03:21.879> wise

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
and so we'll have to use wise

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.559 
and so we'll have to use wise
regulations<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.560> increasing<00:03:24.220> technology<00:03:24.849> to

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
regulations and increasing technology to

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.929 
regulations and increasing technology to
shift<00:03:25.629> from<00:03:26.109> non-renewable<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:27.159> renewable

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
shift from non-renewable to renewable

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.729 
shift from non-renewable to renewable
resources<00:03:28.479> and<00:03:28.629> so<00:03:28.870> how<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.260> teach<00:03:29.470> this

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
resources and so how do you teach this

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.649 
resources and so how do you teach this
what's<00:03:29.949> the<00:03:30.129> teaching<00:03:30.489> progression<00:03:30.669> well<00:03:31.479> in

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
what's the teaching progression well in

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.179 
what's the teaching progression well in
the<00:03:31.750> lower<00:03:31.930> elementary<00:03:32.079> grades<00:03:32.829> you<00:03:32.949> want

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
the lower elementary grades you want

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.619 
the lower elementary grades you want
students<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.579> understand<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.239> humans

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
students to understand that humans

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.780 
students to understand that humans
require<00:03:34.810> resources<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.069> they<00:03:36.189> require<00:03:36.609> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
require resources and they require it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.890 
require resources and they require it
from<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.209> land<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.530> air<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:40.120> water<00:03:40.479> and

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
from the land the air and the water and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.899 
from the land the air and the water and
so<00:03:41.079> let's<00:03:41.319> use<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.560> real<00:03:41.829> simple<00:03:41.859> example<00:03:42.370> of

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
so let's use a real simple example of

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.149 
so let's use a real simple example of
that<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.299> do<00:03:43.359> we<00:03:43.479> need<00:03:43.659> from<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.109> land<00:03:44.379> well

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
that what do we need from the land well

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.189 
that what do we need from the land well
we<00:03:45.280> need<00:03:45.459> food<00:03:45.729> and<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.209> when<00:03:46.359> we<00:03:46.509> grow<00:03:46.750> corn

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
we need food and so when we grow corn

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.530 
we need food and so when we grow corn
for<00:03:47.470> example<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:48.099> knew<00:03:48.340> nutrients<00:03:48.970> from<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
for example we knew nutrients from the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.990 
for example we knew nutrients from the
land<00:03:49.840> or<00:03:50.229> the<00:03:50.439> soil<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:51.040> need<00:03:51.069> nutrients<00:03:51.909> from

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
land or the soil we need nutrients from

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.879 
land or the soil we need nutrients from
the<00:03:52.120> air<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.599> we<00:03:52.720> also<00:03:52.870> need<00:03:53.139> water<00:03:53.409> for<00:03:53.769> that

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
the air and we also need water for that

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.520 
the air and we also need water for that
if<00:03:54.579> we<00:03:54.790> get<00:03:55.000> energy<00:03:55.269> from<00:03:55.810> our<00:03:56.109> environment

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
if we get energy from our environment

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.860 
if we get energy from our environment
burning<00:03:57.250> wood<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.729> going<00:03:57.909> to<00:03:57.970> require<00:03:58.299> energy

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
burning wood is going to require energy

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.990 
burning wood is going to require energy
and<00:03:59.109> that's<00:03:59.290> coming<00:03:59.739> from<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.129> land<00:04:00.370> as<00:04:00.729> well

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and that's coming from the land as well

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.629 
and that's coming from the land as well
and<00:04:01.269> if<00:04:01.750> we<00:04:01.900> want<00:04:02.259> to<00:04:02.349> fry<00:04:02.590> up<00:04:02.769> some<00:04:02.799> eggs<00:04:03.250> we're

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
and if we want to fry up some eggs we're

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.099 
and if we want to fry up some eggs we're
going<00:04:03.759> to<00:04:03.819> require<00:04:04.180> minerals<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.019> we're

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
going to require minerals and we're

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.330 
going to require minerals and we're
going<00:04:05.229> to<00:04:05.259> have<00:04:05.439> to<00:04:05.590> get<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:05.799> from<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.129> land

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
going to have to get that from the land

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420 
going to have to get that from the land
as<00:04:06.489> well<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.909> so<00:04:07.290> everything<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.560> require<00:04:09.009> for

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
as well and so everything we require for

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
as well and so everything we require for
resources<00:04:10.030> we're<00:04:10.359> getting<00:04:10.750> from<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.319> land

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
resources we're getting from the land

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.619 
resources we're getting from the land
itself<00:04:12.340> as<00:04:12.549> we<00:04:12.970> move<00:04:13.209> into<00:04:13.419> the<00:04:13.599> upper

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
itself as we move into the upper

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.809 
itself as we move into the upper
elementary<00:04:13.989> grades<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:15.009> want<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.579> start

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
elementary grades you want to start

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.310 
elementary grades you want to start
talking<00:04:16.120> about<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.389> idea<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.780> natural

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
talking about this idea of natural

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.349 
talking about this idea of natural
resources<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.159> that<00:04:18.310> all<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.759> the<00:04:18.880> resources

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
resources and that all of the resources

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.260 
resources and that all of the resources
we<00:04:19.690> require<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.380> live<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.310> come<00:04:21.609> from<00:04:21.940> our

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
we require to live have to come from our

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.480 
we require to live have to come from our
planet<00:04:22.960> another<00:04:23.800> thing<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.159> should<00:04:24.190> talk

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
planet another thing you should talk

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.100 
planet another thing you should talk
about<00:04:24.729> at<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.000> point<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.450> make<00:04:25.900> sure

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
about at this point is make sure

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.300 
about at this point is make sure
you're<00:04:26.259> delineating<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.919> difference

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
you're delineating the difference

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.700 
you're delineating the difference
between<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.699> renewable<00:04:28.300> resource<00:04:28.449> one<00:04:29.289> that<00:04:29.500> we

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
between a renewable resource one that we

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.010 
between a renewable resource one that we
can<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:30.099> comes<00:04:30.610> back<00:04:30.699> over<00:04:31.389> our<00:04:31.539> lifetime

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
can just comes back over our lifetime

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.920 
can just comes back over our lifetime
and<00:04:32.259> non-renewable<00:04:32.860> resources<00:04:33.699> so<00:04:34.120> as<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.689> dig

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
and non-renewable resources so as we dig

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.290 
and non-renewable resources so as we dig
up<00:04:35.080> metal<00:04:35.500> if<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:35.860> aren't<00:04:36.039> recycling<00:04:36.669> those<00:04:36.849> if

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
up metal if we aren't recycling those if

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.420 
up metal if we aren't recycling those if
we're<00:04:37.810> just<00:04:37.930> disposing<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.129> it's<00:04:39.280> going<00:04:39.370> to

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
we're just disposing of it it's going to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.089 
we're just disposing of it it's going to
be<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.580> non-renewable<00:04:40.120> resource<00:04:40.509> as<00:04:41.349> you<00:04:41.919> move

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
be a non-renewable resource as you move

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.860 
be a non-renewable resource as you move
into<00:04:42.310> middle<00:04:42.639> school<00:04:42.879> we<00:04:43.150> want<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.479> talk<00:04:43.689> about

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
into middle school we want to talk about

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.899 
into middle school we want to talk about
resources<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:44.949> where<00:04:45.069> they're<00:04:45.219> found<00:04:45.550> and

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
resources and where they're found and

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.790 
resources and where they're found and
that<00:04:46.150> they're<00:04:46.389> limited<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.259> that<00:04:47.560> they're

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
that they're limited and that they're

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.980 
that they're limited and that they're
not<00:04:47.830> evenly<00:04:48.460> distributed<00:04:48.580> on<00:04:49.330> our<00:04:49.539> planet<00:04:49.840> and

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
not evenly distributed on our planet and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.719 
not evenly distributed on our planet and
so<00:04:50.110> we<00:04:50.259> have<00:04:50.409> to<00:04:50.560> be<00:04:50.680> wise<00:04:50.919> in<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> way<00:04:51.580> that

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
so we have to be wise in the way that

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.029 
so we have to be wise in the way that
we're<00:04:51.879> using<00:04:52.150> those<00:04:52.419> resources<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.770> then<00:04:53.919> we

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
we're using those resources and then we

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.679 
we're using those resources and then we
want<00:04:54.219> to<00:04:54.310> talk<00:04:54.460> about<00:04:54.759> how<00:04:55.000> there's<00:04:55.360> going<00:04:55.599> to

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
want to talk about how there's going to

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.540 
want to talk about how there's going to
be<00:04:55.780> increases<00:04:56.469> in<00:04:56.620> technology<00:04:57.250> which<00:04:57.400> are

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
be increases in technology which are

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.920 
be increases in technology which are
going<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.729> allow<00:04:57.849> us<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.240> shift<00:04:58.719> from

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
going to allow us to shift from

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.469 
going to allow us to shift from
non-renewable<00:04:59.529> to<00:05:00.069> renewable<00:05:00.699> resources<00:05:01.180> but

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
non-renewable to renewable resources but

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.029 
non-renewable to renewable resources but
we're<00:05:01.599> going<00:05:01.689> to<00:05:01.750> have<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.080> use<00:05:02.199> regulations

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
we're going to have to use regulations

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.950 
we're going to have to use regulations
to<00:05:03.759> make<00:05:03.939> sure<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.300> we're<00:05:04.569> doing<00:05:04.689> this

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
to make sure that we're doing this

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.800 
to make sure that we're doing this
fairly<00:05:05.409> and<00:05:05.949> effectively<00:05:06.310> across<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.539> globe

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
fairly and effectively across the globe

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.990 
fairly and effectively across the globe
as<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.620> move<00:05:08.830> into<00:05:09.039> high<00:05:09.159> school<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.729> want<00:05:09.939> to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
as you move into high school you want to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.570 
as you move into high school you want to
address<00:05:10.539> this<00:05:10.840> idea<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.560> our<00:05:11.590> population<00:05:11.889> is

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
address this idea that our population is

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.969 
address this idea that our population is
increasing<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.509> as<00:05:14.050> we<00:05:14.229> get<00:05:14.379> more<00:05:14.439> and<00:05:14.919> more

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
increasing and as we get more and more

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.399 
increasing and as we get more and more
people<00:05:15.400> they're<00:05:16.300> going<00:05:16.509> to<00:05:16.689> require<00:05:16.990> more<00:05:17.379> and

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
people they're going to require more and

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.439 
people they're going to require more and
more<00:05:17.590> resources<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.580> so<00:05:18.699> we<00:05:18.819> have<00:05:19.029> to<00:05:19.180> look<00:05:19.330> at

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
more resources and so we have to look at

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.420 
more resources and so we have to look at
all<00:05:19.629> of<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.960> resources<00:05:20.409> on<00:05:20.680> our<00:05:20.710> planet<00:05:21.099> where

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
all of the resources on our planet where

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.580 
all of the resources on our planet where
they<00:05:21.639> found<00:05:21.969> how<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.419> we<00:05:22.569> share<00:05:22.810> them<00:05:23.080> equally

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
they found how can we share them equally

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.309 
they found how can we share them equally
and<00:05:23.979> how<00:05:24.520> can<00:05:24.580> we<00:05:24.849> make<00:05:25.000> sure<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.599> as<00:05:25.810> people

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
and how can we make sure that as people

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.230 
and how can we make sure that as people
in<00:05:26.469> developing<00:05:26.949> countries<00:05:27.009> start<00:05:27.879> to<00:05:28.060> get

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
in developing countries start to get

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.820 
in developing countries start to get
what<00:05:28.539> people<00:05:28.840> in<00:05:28.990> developed<00:05:29.379> countries<00:05:29.710> have

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
what people in developed countries have

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.890 
what people in developed countries have
had<00:05:29.889> for<00:05:30.129> a<00:05:30.159> long<00:05:30.370> time<00:05:30.699> how<00:05:31.360> do<00:05:31.419> we<00:05:31.539> do<00:05:31.719> that

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
had for a long time how do we do that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.050 
had for a long time how do we do that
effectively<00:05:32.050> without<00:05:32.919> damaging<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.669> planet

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
effectively without damaging the planet

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.969 
effectively without damaging the planet
so<00:05:34.479> those<00:05:34.659> are<00:05:34.779> natural<00:05:34.930> resources<00:05:35.800> they're

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
so those are natural resources they're

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.680 
so those are natural resources they're
incredibly<00:05:36.550> important<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.270> hope<00:05:37.419> that<00:05:37.569> was

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
incredibly important and I hope that was

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.719 
incredibly important and I hope that was
helpful
