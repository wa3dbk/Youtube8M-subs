00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.300
 40 another fact or any other program that serves to design 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.940
 the drawing is 2 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.010

 per cent the icons a always before 32 by 32 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.960
 Also if they have required size 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.000
 per 100 and internet 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.910
 tell him transparent touch 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 he has already created a baquiano quickly 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.250
 it can be a circle 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.239
 who loses 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.799
 who does 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.719
 that says 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 58 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.249
 58 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.519

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.859
 irun 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.590
 the how in mons 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.720
 are already 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.779
 then when we have it created 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.999
 for blind you do not know country isa peace 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.519

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.770
 come on let's see name vehicles always remember 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.770
 this measure has to be living transport among others 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.509
 and the cinema format that is expected to start 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.149
 then when we have it, we will turn it into an icon 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:02.209
 for this we need to go to the page convert ico points with 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.530
 the cis did not understand if the oea I'm going to enter him 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.599
 intel 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.319
 in a link in the description 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.969
 for whom 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.819
 i can enter 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.819
 between what to the series late the Chinese coach 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.749
 they will go down a bit 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.919
 and the Catholics 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.919
 efe then there is no need to hide 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.659
 wait for a while 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.999
 ileana that violates itself alone 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.959
 teresa is that he is going to leave the image simply by clicking right and 4th is 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.159
 wait at the desk 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 already when they have these they will have the image 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.399
 this is the icon 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.499
 the how we see the semicolon 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.909
 i will then give to get the game 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.239
 first a little bit that I already have it here open enclosures in mind the fact 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.359
 and the air I'm going to give balance to tlc seth fans 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.390
 after harley 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.300
 the state the first in many graphics first let's go 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.309
 to there 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.259
 and there are those who anticipated 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.749
 the day on the icon and in April 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.459
 read it 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.389
 i if we enter again 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 let's see what if it remains with the icon 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.979
 but still its time that yes carlyle and accountant 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.620
 i as we see here below 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.550
 the disc what we have created 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.510
 and is that the percent game and 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.559
 hooker the stable cast of the game 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.850
 you will also be left with this icon 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.290
 so it is a good tool to customize our games 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.139
 so I hope you can use the tutorial 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.439
