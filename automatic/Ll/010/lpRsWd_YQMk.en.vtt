00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
now let me tell you what I did I just

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.009 
now let me tell you what I did I just
something<00:00:58.070> different<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.460> time<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:59.030> did<00:00:59.809> cut

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
something different this time I did cut

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.990 
something different this time I did cut
the<00:01:00.140> lace<00:01:00.290> on<00:01:00.589> top<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.430> little<00:01:01.670> part<00:01:01.939> right

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
the lace on top that little part right

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.190 
the lace on top that little part right
here<00:01:02.119> I<00:01:02.540> cut<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:05.239> got<00:01:05.449> my<00:01:05.659> hair<00:01:05.930> coming

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
here I cut it and I got my hair coming

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.830 
here I cut it and I got my hair coming
out<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.320> think<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.680> gives<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.100> more

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
out and I think it gives it a more

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.210 
out and I think it gives it a more
realistic<00:01:11.840> look<00:01:12.350> when<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:12.770> comes<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.100> that

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
realistic look when it comes to that

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.550 
realistic look when it comes to that
party<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.299> don't<00:01:14.479> do<00:01:14.600> them<00:01:14.750> sake<00:01:14.960> bar<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.530> I
