they<00:00:01.319> didn't<00:00:02.040> know<00:00:02.129> what<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.429> expect<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:03.410> I

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
they didn't know what to expect and I

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.410 
they didn't know what to expect and I
kind<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.009> thought<00:00:05.220> when<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.520> went<00:00:05.759> there<00:00:05.819> they

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
kind of thought when we went there they

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:45.900 
kind of thought when we went there they
might<00:00:06.660> find<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.080> really<00:00:07.500> boring

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.900 

do<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.750> know<00:00:46.870> where<00:00:47.080> we<00:00:47.200> are<00:00:47.350> people<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.760> is

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
do you know where we are people this is

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.850 
do you know where we are people this is
Sydney<00:00:49.330> Olympic<00:00:49.780> Stadium<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.380> this<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:50.620> like

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
Sydney Olympic Stadium and this is like

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.350 
Sydney Olympic Stadium and this is like
the<00:00:51.280> future<00:00:51.490> of<00:00:51.730> Olympics

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
the future of Olympics

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.270 
the future of Olympics
never<00:00:52.660> mind<00:00:52.900> human<00:00:53.200> competition<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.100> is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
never mind human competition this is

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.180 
never mind human competition this is
robot<00:00:54.760> against<00:00:55.150> robot<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.290> like<00:00:56.530> machines

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
robot against robot it is like machines

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.910 
robot against robot it is like machines
when<00:00:57.970> I<00:00:58.000> was<00:00:58.180> a<00:00:58.210> kid<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.750> think<00:00:59.410> like<00:00:59.530> any<00:00:59.680> kid

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
when I was a kid I think like any kid

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.990 
when I was a kid I think like any kid
you<00:01:00.010> don't<00:01:00.100> really<00:01:00.370> know<00:01:00.550> what<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.760> want<00:01:00.940> to

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
you don't really know what you want to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.079 
you don't really know what you want to
do<00:01:01.150> when<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.390> grow<00:01:01.540> up<00:01:01.570> I<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.760> think<00:01:03.880> I<00:01:03.940> have

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
do when you grow up I don't think I have

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.690 
do when you grow up I don't think I have
a<00:01:04.120> plan<00:01:04.480> to<00:01:04.660> be<00:01:04.809> an<00:01:04.870> engineer<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.590> think<00:01:06.490> just

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
a plan to be an engineer I think just

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.340 
a plan to be an engineer I think just
going<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.090> there<00:01:07.180> engineering<00:01:07.720> is<00:01:07.840> just<00:01:07.930> a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
going in there engineering is just a

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:37.789 
going in there engineering is just a
side<00:01:08.800> effect<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.370> enjoying<00:01:10.030> building<00:01:10.480> things

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.020 

so<00:01:38.799> these<00:01:38.920> teams<00:01:39.189> are<00:01:39.340> putting<00:01:39.700> their<00:01:39.820> amateur

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
so these teams are putting their amateur

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.880 
so these teams are putting their amateur
there<00:01:40.330> look<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.170> like<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.470> real

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
there look this this is like a real

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.530 
there look this this is like a real
robot<00:01:42.340> right<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:43.030> check<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.330> out

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
robot right here like check this out

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.160 
robot right here like check this out
let's<00:01:43.780> have<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.930> look<00:01:44.130> mainly<00:01:45.130> it's<00:01:45.369> like

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
let's have a look mainly it's like

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.899 
let's have a look mainly it's like
actuators<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.409> motors<00:01:47.890> here<00:01:48.130> there's<00:01:48.670> like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
actuators as motors here there's like

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.179 
actuators as motors here there's like
stress<00:01:49.509> stressed<00:01:49.990> out<00:01:50.200> cables<00:01:50.619> as<00:01:50.799> chains

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
stress stressed out cables as chains

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.419 
stress stressed out cables as chains
there's<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:51.939> all<00:01:52.330> these<00:01:52.450> control<00:01:52.929> wires

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
there's like all these control wires

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.270 
there's like all these control wires
servos<00:01:54.429> are<00:01:54.610> probably<00:01:54.820> in<00:01:54.939> there<00:01:55.090> somewhere

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
servos are probably in there somewhere

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.980 
servos are probably in there somewhere
Wow<00:01:57.280> would<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.850> like<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> build<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.330> robot<00:01:58.689> I

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
Wow would you like to build a robot I

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.630 
Wow would you like to build a robot I
don't<00:01:59.830> think<00:02:00.100> so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
don't think so

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
don't think so
why<00:02:01.179> not<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:02.770> they<00:02:03.070> could<00:02:03.310> electrocute

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
why not because they could electrocute

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.279 
why not because they could electrocute
people<00:02:05.970> when<00:02:06.970> kids<00:02:07.299> see<00:02:07.450> robots<00:02:07.780> or<00:02:08.200> will

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
people when kids see robots or will

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.570 
people when kids see robots or will
think<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.590> robots<00:02:08.739> they<00:02:09.009> probably<00:02:09.190> think<00:02:09.429> of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
think of robots they probably think of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.610 
think of robots they probably think of
movies<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.060> cartoons<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.810> that's<00:02:11.019> just<00:02:11.470> not

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
movies and cartoons and that's just not

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.550 
movies and cartoons and that's just not
reality<00:02:11.860> right<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.569> today

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
reality right you know today

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.199 
reality right you know today
cars<00:02:14.890> are<00:02:15.100> built<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.370> robots<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
cars are built with robots a lot of the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.940 
cars are built with robots a lot of the
consumer<00:02:16.630> electronics<00:02:17.140> he<00:02:17.260> buys<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:17.769> with

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
consumer electronics he buys but with

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.800 
consumer electronics he buys but with
robots<00:02:18.340> tons<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.269> things<00:02:19.390> are<00:02:19.569> built<00:02:19.690> with

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
robots tons of things are built with

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.750 
robots tons of things are built with
robots<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.319> they<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:21.069> are<00:02:21.100> not<00:02:21.610> only

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
robots and they they are not only

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.190 
robots and they they are not only
changing<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.269> world<00:02:22.510> they'll<00:02:22.690> continue<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
changing the world they'll continue to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440 
changing the world they'll continue to
change<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> world<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.850> take<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> kids<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
change the world if you take the kids to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.420 
change the world if you take the kids to
actually<00:02:25.540> show<00:02:25.989> them<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.350> they<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.560> they

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
actually show them what they do they

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.770 
actually show them what they do they
might<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.790> interested<00:02:28.209> they<00:02:28.330> might<00:02:28.540> want<00:02:28.750> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
might get interested they might want to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:45.120 
might get interested they might want to
actually<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.349> know<00:02:29.440> do<00:02:29.680> stuff<00:02:29.920> themselves

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.400 

so<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> Lego<00:02:46.390> brick<00:02:46.600> which<00:02:46.930> controls

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
so this is a Lego brick which controls

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.170 
so this is a Lego brick which controls
everything<00:02:47.740> and<00:02:48.100> there's<00:02:48.250> cables<00:02:48.730> connecting

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
everything and there's cables connecting

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.060 
everything and there's cables connecting
to<00:02:49.300> all<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.540> motors<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.080> stuff<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.560> they're

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
to all the motors and stuff and they're

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.660 
to all the motors and stuff and they're
learning<00:02:51.160> all<00:02:51.340> sorts<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.640> stuff<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.210> fun

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
learning all sorts of stuff is it fun

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
learning all sorts of stuff is it fun
what<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.880> think

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
what do you think

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:08.030 
what do you think
I<00:02:56.530> think<00:02:57.310> sir<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:58.350> think<00:02:59.350> they're<00:02:59.470> having<00:02:59.560> fun

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.850 

now<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> program<00:03:09.629> these<00:03:10.080> were<00:03:10.290> re<00:03:10.440> abouts<00:03:10.620> to

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
now a program these were re abouts to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580 
now a program these were re abouts to
base<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.310> fishing<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:12.870> team<00:03:13.080> spent<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.379> lot<00:03:13.560> of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
base all fishing the team spent a lot of

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.990 
base all fishing the team spent a lot of
time<00:03:13.920> ensuring<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.430> they<00:03:14.670> keep<00:03:14.849> their

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
time ensuring that they keep their

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670 
time ensuring that they keep their
robots<00:03:15.330> as<00:03:15.510> simple<00:03:15.840> as<00:03:15.959> possible<00:03:16.140> because

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
robots as simple as possible because

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160 
robots as simple as possible because
simple<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> very<00:03:18.450> good<00:03:18.690> engineering

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
simple is a very good engineering

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.130 
simple is a very good engineering
practice<00:03:20.360> okay

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
practice okay

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.020 
practice okay
what<00:03:23.950> did<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.310> most<00:03:24.370> about<00:03:24.760> the

what did you like most about the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.710 
what did you like most about the
robotics<00:03:25.510> competition<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.410> like<00:03:26.830> everything

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
robotics competition I like everything

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:39.810 
robotics competition I like everything
nothing<00:03:28.720> was<00:03:28.870> my<00:03:29.110> favorite<00:03:38.400> right<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.640> did

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
nothing was my favorite right so did

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.500 
nothing was my favorite right so did
your<00:03:39.970> Lego<00:03:40.270> robot<00:03:40.660> go<00:03:40.900> really<00:03:41.230> well<00:03:42.420> do<00:03:43.420> you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
your Lego robot go really well do you

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.030 
your Lego robot go really well do you
think<00:03:43.690> you'll<00:03:43.810> build<00:03:44.110> bigger<00:03:44.380> robots<00:03:44.830> when

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
think you'll build bigger robots when

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.300 
think you'll build bigger robots when
you're<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.190> bit<00:03:45.340> older<00:03:46.380> they<00:03:47.380> were<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:47.770> smiles

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
their eyes to a new world and that world

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.010 
their eyes to a new world and that world
is<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.310> world<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:54.640> technology<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.840> be

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
is the world of technology and it can be

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.530 
is the world of technology and it can be
fun<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.770> unless<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.820> see<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:58.209> yourself

robots<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.150> what<00:04:10.269> do<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:10.420> guys<00:04:10.540> think<00:04:10.600> should

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
robots so what do you guys think should

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:21.970 
robots so what do you guys think should
we<00:04:11.140> go<00:04:11.260> build<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.590> robot

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.040
