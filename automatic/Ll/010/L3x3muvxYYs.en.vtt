00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 How does Monash qualify you for the job market? 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.340
 Monash University offers great opportunities for students to become qualified for the job market. 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.719
 One of the main strategies we use is to grant 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.840
 Students have the opportunity to participate in the community as part of their studies. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.349
 We also have a range of professional courses 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.000
 Which really provides students with excellent training that helps them in their careers. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.399
 It is really important that students participate in the profession they are looking for 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.160
 Her at a very early stage of their studies. 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.609
 We help students become qualified for the job market by holding a range of professional courses. 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:47.899
 We have developed a set of programs designed to go beyond the usual classroom / classroom model. 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.190
 We offer students many different opportunities to engage with employers. 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.839
 We hold the Job Fair twice a year to give our students an opportunity to attend and meet 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.859
 Many employers work in their various disciplines and talk to them about their potential career opportunities. 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.260
 We have a lot of job openings that host professionals and you can meet and welcome them. 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.880
 So it's a great way to: 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.220
 1. Get qualifications to write in your resume 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.750
 2. Interview these people and introduce yourself to them 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 3. Great opportunity to gain more friends 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 I have realized the importance of network meetings in cooperation with others 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.850
 Of different age groups or cultural backgrounds, regardless of their class or nature. 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 You should realize how important social networking is, as well as the importance of developing this skill in the early stages of life. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.890
 I try to help students develop their skills in talking and interacting with people to ensure their passion for education and not just their technical specialization. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.630
 But for others, the world around them, there are still things that are wider than they have reached. 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.480
 Much effort is being made at the Faculty of Law for Career Awareness. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.000
 Among our compulsory units is the "Enhancing Access to a Job" 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.110
 It is a specially designed lecture to induce students to think about their career careers early on. 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.360
 Monash Careers is truly a key point for any professional information. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 Monash will make me ready and ready for professional life because it has advanced and wonderful facilities. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.229
 Your education is not only academic but also practical. 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.459
 If you are doing something other than the school curriculum, this is a really good thing in your curriculum vitae, 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.170
 It indicates your ability to handle many tasks and shows you have time management skills. 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.480
 This gives students the opportunity to enhance their education 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.380
 And apply what they have learned in practical situations.
