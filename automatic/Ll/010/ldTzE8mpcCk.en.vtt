those areas that I want a little more
coverage<00:04:06.250> I'm<00:04:07.210> just<00:04:07.390> using<00:04:07.630> what's<00:04:07.930> left<00:04:08.050> over

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
coverage I'm just using what's left over

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.370 
coverage I'm just using what's left over
on<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.920> pan<00:04:09.660> because<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.050> got<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
on the pan because I just got the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.900 
on the pan because I just got the
perfect<00:04:11.650> amount<00:04:17.190> all<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.489> there's<00:04:18.700> that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
perfect amount all right so there's that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.680 
perfect amount all right so there's that
sure<00:04:19.360> application<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> foundation

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
sure application of the foundation

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.640
