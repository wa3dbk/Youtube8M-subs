hi<00:00:09.910> welcome<00:00:10.540> to<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:10.960> new<00:00:11.110> video<00:00:12.150> I'm<00:00:13.150> not

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
hi welcome to the new video I'm not

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.970 
hi welcome to the new video I'm not
trying<00:00:13.719> to<00:00:13.809> show<00:00:13.930> you

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
trying to show you

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.330 
trying to show you
how<00:00:15.219> good<00:00:15.490> fitting<00:00:15.879> stencils<00:00:16.600> are<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:18.130> this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
how good fitting stencils are for this

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.179 
how good fitting stencils are for this
I'm<00:00:18.750> using<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:20.080> spray<00:00:20.470> can<00:00:20.800> was<00:00:21.070> blackened

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I'm using the spray can was blackened

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.100 
I'm using the spray can was blackened
paint<00:00:24.189> on<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.579> new<00:00:24.849> stencil<00:00:25.240> so<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.689> can't

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
paint on the new stencil so you can't

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.850 
paint on the new stencil so you can't
look<00:00:26.500> through<00:00:26.949> any<00:00:27.099> more<00:00:27.400> so<00:00:28.270> everything

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
look through any more so everything

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.100 
look through any more so everything
relies<00:00:29.860> on<00:00:29.919> that<00:00:30.430> well<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:31.599> fit<00:00:31.839> of<00:00:31.869> this

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
relies on that well the fit of this

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.360 
relies on that well the fit of this
templates<00:00:32.650> are<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:35.129> actually<00:00:36.129> I'm<00:00:36.960> more

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
templates are so actually I'm more

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.920 
templates are so actually I'm more
working<00:00:39.370> on<00:00:39.460> shows<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.940> conventions<00:00:40.089> so<00:00:40.690> I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
working on shows and conventions so I

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.530 
working on shows and conventions so I
don't<00:00:41.680> have<00:00:41.860> time<00:00:42.129> to<00:00:42.430> clean<00:00:42.670> every<00:00:43.150> time<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
don't have time to clean every time the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.369 
don't have time to clean every time the
stencils<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:44.829> now<00:00:45.010> show<00:00:45.339> you<00:00:45.420> how<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.600> use<00:00:47.050> them

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
stencils so now show you how to use them

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.619 
stencils so now show you how to use them
with<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:50.170> stencil<00:00:50.920> technique<00:00:51.340> even<00:00:51.629> though

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
with my stencil technique even though

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:53.819 
with my stencil technique even though
you<00:00:52.690> can't<00:00:53.050> look<00:00:53.170> through<00:00:53.379> them

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
you can't look through them

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.599 
you can't look through them
so<00:00:54.340> first<00:00:54.760> I'm<00:00:54.910> using<00:00:54.940> in<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.570> park<00:00:55.809> wait<00:00:56.609> to

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
so first I'm using in the park wait to

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.660 
so first I'm using in the park wait to
lay<00:00:57.789> down<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:59.109> sculpt<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.980> actually<00:01:03.399> this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
lay down the sculpt and actually this

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.109 
lay down the sculpt and actually this
new<00:01:04.479> scale<00:01:04.750> design<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.770> are<00:01:08.979> some<00:01:09.220> freehand

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
new scale design which are some freehand

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.529 
new scale design which are some freehand
flame<00:01:10.929> shapes<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:13.270> actually<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:15.539> doesn't

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
flame shapes I'm actually just doesn't

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.889 
flame shapes I'm actually just doesn't
matter<00:01:16.660> how<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.929> looks<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:19.420> something

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
matter how it looks just that something

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.330 
matter how it looks just that something
is<00:01:20.080> behind<00:01:20.349> the<00:01:20.709> scale<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.160> is<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:23.080> dark

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.960 

okay<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.259> apart<00:01:29.530> white<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.759> we're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
okay this is the apart white now we're

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.990 
okay this is the apart white now we're
switching<00:01:31.239> to<00:01:31.569> you<00:01:31.660> in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.899> park<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.349> black

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
switching to you in the park of black

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.089 
switching to you in the park of black
and<00:01:34.000> lay<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.110> first<00:01:35.590> stencil<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:36.009> you

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
and lay down the first stencil as you

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.350 
and lay down the first stencil as you
can<00:01:36.250> see<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.489> can't<00:01:36.729> look<00:01:36.910> through<00:01:37.149> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
can see you can't look through it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.650 
can see you can't look through it
anymore<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.819> look<00:01:40.060> like<00:01:40.300> four

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
anymore so you have to look like four

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.190 
anymore so you have to look like four
opposite<00:01:41.550> positions<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> stencils<00:01:43.569> to<00:01:43.690> to

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
opposite positions in the stencils to to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.150 
opposite positions in the stencils to to
fit<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.569> here's<00:01:46.569> I<00:01:46.810> think<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.590> cheekbone

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
fit it so here's I think the cheekbone

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.479 
fit it so here's I think the cheekbone
and<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.380> bottom<00:01:50.739> of<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.130> jaw<00:01:53.190> since<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.310> see

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:54.489 
and the bottom of the jaw since you see

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.650 
and the bottom of the jaw since you see
us<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.700> your<00:01:54.849> Park<00:01:55.060> black<00:01:55.300> now<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.890> we're<00:01:57.369> just

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
us in your Park black now and we're just

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.540 
us in your Park black now and we're just
painting<00:01:58.660> everything<00:01:58.929> black<00:01:59.289> as<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.340> see

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
painting everything black as you can see

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.040 
painting everything black as you can see
the<00:02:00.759> whole<00:02:01.080> stencil<00:02:02.080> moves<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:05.429> try<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.869> not

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the whole stencil moves so try to do not

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.559 
the whole stencil moves so try to do not
move<00:02:08.289> too<00:02:08.560> fast<00:02:08.800> Missy<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> brush<00:02:09.550> too<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.360> can

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
move too fast Missy a brush too you can

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.320 
move too fast Missy a brush too you can
use<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.290> air<00:02:12.190> pressure<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.879> comes<00:02:13.090> out<00:02:13.300> of

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
use the air pressure that comes out of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.100 
use the air pressure that comes out of
the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.160 
the
and<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:14.560> there<00:02:14.830> was<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.130> brush<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:16.180> pick<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.750> pin

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
and so there was a brush to pick to pin

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.360 
and so there was a brush to pick to pin
down<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.560> stencil<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.750> again<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.380> part<00:02:21.160> black

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
down to stencil so again a part black

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
down to stencil so again a part black
but<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:21.880> time<00:02:22.150> was<00:02:22.360> last<00:02:22.540> pack<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.870> see<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.380> you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
but this time was last pack I see so you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.980 
but this time was last pack I see so you
get<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:24.070> great<00:02:24.550> Oh<00:02:24.700> Oh<00:02:26.400> dark<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.420> Grays<00:02:28.690> is

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
get a great Oh Oh dark and the Grays is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.200 
get a great Oh Oh dark and the Grays is
up<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.500> I'll<00:02:29.740> how<00:02:30.730> much<00:02:32.670> no<00:02:33.670> doc<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.910> want

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.270 

so<00:02:40.790> again<00:02:41.030> look<00:02:41.750> for<00:02:41.960> opposite<00:02:42.350> positions

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
so again look for opposite positions

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.940 
so again look for opposite positions
maybe<00:02:44.270> if<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.750> are<00:02:44.930> using<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.470> these

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
maybe if you are using the these

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280 
maybe if you are using the these
template<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.640> first<00:02:46.850> time<00:02:47.090> make<00:02:47.990> some

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
template for the first time make some

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.100 
template for the first time make some
markers<00:02:49.070> on<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.460> stencil<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:50.960> can

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
markers on the stencil so that you can

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.320 
markers on the stencil so that you can
find<00:02:51.410> them<00:02:51.620> afterwards<00:02:54.430> even<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.790> stencil

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
find them afterwards even if the stencil

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.620 
find them afterwards even if the stencil
is<00:02:56.450> dirty<00:02:59.080> so<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:00.340> I'm<00:03:01.340> using<00:03:01.610> transmen<00:03:02.360> cards

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
is dirty so now I'm using transmen cards

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.830 
is dirty so now I'm using transmen cards
now<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:03.170> doing<00:03:03.470> some<00:03:03.830> colors<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.430> this<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
now for doing some colors and this is a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.220 
now for doing some colors and this is a
light<00:03:06.110> brown<00:03:06.880> 90%<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:08.210> yellow<00:03:08.480> ends<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.960> little

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
light brown 90% a yellow ends a little

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.340 
light brown 90% a yellow ends a little
bit<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.620> purple<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.280> achieve<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.210> color<00:03:11.510> it's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
bit of purple to achieve this color it's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.700 
bit of purple to achieve this color it's
perfect<00:03:12.800> for<00:03:12.830> skin<00:03:13.190> tones<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:13.640> also<00:03:14.240> for<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
perfect for skin tones and also for the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:22.980 
perfect for skin tones and also for the
skeletons<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:16.760> now<00:03:17.060> has<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.720> transparent<00:03:18.500> red

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.260 

and<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.260> can<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:24.650> how<00:03:24.890> nicely<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.820> colors

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
and you can see how nicely the colors

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.340 
and you can see how nicely the colors
mix<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.140> surface<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.870> using<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
mix on the surface now using a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.510 
mix on the surface now using a
transplant<00:03:31.100> yellow<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.160> see<00:03:34.340> around

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
transplant yellow and you can see around

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.540 
transplant yellow and you can see around
the<00:03:34.820> eyes<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.270> skull<00:03:35.510> now<00:03:36.070> with<00:03:37.070> red<00:03:37.340> and

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
the eyes of the skull now with red and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.760 
the eyes of the skull now with red and
yellow<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.880> get<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> nice<00:03:38.420> orange<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.700> is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
yellow you get a nice orange this is

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.570 
yellow you get a nice orange this is
heat<00:03:42.770> dry<00:03:43.130> earth<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:47.750> draw<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.080> surface

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
heat dry earth to to draw the surface

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
heat dry earth to to draw the surface
now<00:03:49.580> we<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.330> last<00:03:50.540> 10<00:03:50.810> saw<00:03:51.020> in<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.410> case

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
now we have the last 10 saw in this case

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.970 
now we have the last 10 saw in this case
looking<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.990> teeth<00:03:56.440> for<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.470> perfect

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
looking for the teeth for the perfect

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.470 
looking for the teeth for the perfect
fit

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.920 

so<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.470> start<00:04:02.800> every<00:04:03.099> time<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:03.930> parts

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
so in the start every time with parts

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.630 
so in the start every time with parts
that<00:04:05.020> I<00:04:05.200> want<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.530> be<00:04:05.680> really<00:04:06.099> highlighted

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
that I want to be really highlighted

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.360 
that I want to be really highlighted
like<00:04:06.970> in<00:04:07.239> this<00:04:07.360> case<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.930> teeth<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:09.010> area

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
like in this case the teeth and the area

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.199 
like in this case the teeth and the area
of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.540> eyebrows<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.500> there<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.920> gives<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
of the eyebrows so there it gives the

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.390 
of the eyebrows so there it gives the
pure<00:04:16.419> white<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.930> on<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.590> other<00:04:17.829> parts<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.250> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
pure white and on the other parts of the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.370 
pure white and on the other parts of the
stencils<00:04:18.850> on<00:04:19.829> doing<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:20.889> little<00:04:21.040> bit<00:04:21.160> lighter

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
stencils on doing a little bit lighter

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.990 
stencils on doing a little bit lighter
so<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.620> see<00:04:23.830> even<00:04:24.070> though<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.700> can't

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
so you can see even though you can't

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.909 
so you can see even though you can't
look<00:04:25.330> through<00:04:25.690> those<00:04:25.750> temples<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.470> got<00:04:26.680> like

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
look through those temples you got like

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.760 
look through those temples you got like
a<00:04:26.950> perfect<00:04:27.220> match<00:04:27.760> for<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.210> stencils<00:04:28.660> and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.480 

picture<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.919> just<00:04:33.190> perfect<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.190> the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
picture is just perfect so this is the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.780 
picture is just perfect so this is the
cover<00:04:36.729> starting<00:04:37.540> for<00:04:38.280> from<00:04:39.280> doing<00:04:39.520> like<00:04:39.760> a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
cover starting for from doing like a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.420 
cover starting for from doing like a
highlight<00:04:40.210> behind<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.750> skull<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.470> also<00:04:42.220> there

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
highlight behind a skull and also there

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.230 
highlight behind a skull and also there
are<00:04:42.550> some<00:04:43.680> structures<00:04:44.680> for<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.639> inner<00:04:45.820> parts

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
are some structures for the inner parts

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:55.920 
are some structures for the inner parts
of<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.450> mouth<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.770> eye<00:04:48.210> sockets

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.350 

so<00:04:56.590> now<00:04:56.889> I'm<00:04:57.100> using<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:58.030> purple<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:01.150> add<00:05:01.330> a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
so now I'm using the purple to add a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.800 
so now I'm using the purple to add a
local<00:05:02.350> variation<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.160> color<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:03.970> to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
local variation to the color and to

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.210 
local variation to the color and to
paint<00:05:05.410> everything<00:05:05.710> that's<00:05:06.130> inside<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:07.180> black

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
paint everything that's inside the black

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.580 
paint everything that's inside the black
was<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.250> little<00:05:09.460> bit<00:05:09.580> of<00:05:09.669> purple<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:14.440> get<00:05:14.560> a

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
was a little bit of purple so you get a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.390 
was a little bit of purple so you get a
nice<00:05:14.830> 10<00:05:15.130> there<00:05:16.320> actually<00:05:17.320> now<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:18.250> are

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
nice 10 there actually now you are

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.090 
nice 10 there actually now you are
finished<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.930> whole<00:05:20.139> waste<00:05:20.350> came<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.800> like<00:05:21.070> a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
finished the whole waste came to like a

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.279 
finished the whole waste came to like a
little<00:05:21.340> bit<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.610> freehand<00:05:22.240> work<00:05:22.449> in<00:05:22.690> there<00:05:22.960> or

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
little bit of freehand work in there or

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.850 
little bit of freehand work in there or
do<00:05:24.220> some<00:05:24.430> combinations<00:05:25.000> with<00:05:25.180> colors<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:26.620> it's

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
do some combinations with colors so it's

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.790 
do some combinations with colors so it's
up<00:05:27.009> to<00:05:27.039> you<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.550> do<00:05:27.699> like<00:05:28.030> even<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.440> stencil

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.400 
combine it with another background I'm
now<00:05:36.729> doing<00:05:36.789> like<00:05:37.620> free<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.919> glowing<00:05:39.760> eyes<00:05:40.410> I'm

now doing like free and glowing eyes I'm

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.500 
now doing like free and glowing eyes I'm
using<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:42.070> part<00:05:42.340> white<00:05:42.580> for<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.030> first<00:05:43.270> step

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
using a part white for the first step

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.279 
using a part white for the first step
and<00:05:43.750> then<00:05:44.610> transmitted<00:05:45.610> red<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.030> yellow<00:05:46.090> to

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
and then transmitted red and yellow to

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.930 
and then transmitted red and yellow to
make<00:05:47.289> the<00:05:47.470> glue<00:05:48.660> and<00:05:50.669> add<00:05:51.669> a<00:05:52.030> white<00:05:52.389> at<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:53.530> end

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
make the glue and add a white at the end

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.100 
make the glue and add a white at the end
for<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.000> middle<00:05:55.419> part<00:05:55.449> of<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:57.039> eyes<00:05:58.110> to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
for the middle part of the the eyes to
