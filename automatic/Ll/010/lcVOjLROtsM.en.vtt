bike is the bullet my triathlon bike is
the<00:01:56.820> javelin<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> my<00:01:58.350> mountain<00:01:58.740> bike<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the javelin and my mountain bike is the

the javelin and my mountain bike is the
Hellfire<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.350> rocket

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
Hellfire which is actually a rocket

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.289 
Hellfire which is actually a rocket
that's<00:02:01.530> fired<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:01.860> an<00:02:01.979> Apache<00:02:02.250> gunship<00:02:02.820> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
