00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
think it was like a fake leather in a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.940 
think it was like a fake leather in a
gown<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> sort<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.110> taffeta<00:01:28.650> white

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
gown with a sort of like taffeta white

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
gown with a sort of like taffeta white
fabric<00:01:29.420> shouldn't<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.630> work<00:01:30.960> should<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
fabric shouldn't really work should it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.899 
fabric shouldn't really work should it
but<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.270> does<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:34.500> wrongness<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> vision

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but it does the wrongness and the vision

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
but it does the wrongness and the vision
come<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.509> being<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:37.170> Chicago<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
come from being from Chicago there's a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
come from being from Chicago there's a
sort<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> outsider<00:01:38.880> visually<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:39.930> they

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
sort of outsider visually and what they

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
sort of outsider visually and what they
do<00:01:40.110> they're<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.829> sort<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> plagued<00:01:41.610> by

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
do they're not sort of plagued by

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.520 
do they're not sort of plagued by
needing<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> fit<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.409> not

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
needing to fit in because they're not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.960 
needing to fit in because they're not
here<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.369> they're<00:01:44.520> absorbing

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
here and I don't think they're absorbing

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
here and I don't think they're absorbing
the<00:01:45.090> same<00:01:45.299> sense<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> style<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> seeing<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the same sense of style and seeing the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
the same sense of style and seeing the
same<00:01:47.009> things<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:48.240> totally

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
same things I think they have a totally
