00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.999
 8th 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.429
 So if already on the way to Mannheim to answer 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.820
 there are two elements I do not think so 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.220
 On the one hand the changed debt I mean that so by the tax 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.140
 judgment 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.920
 Percent more colleagues are involved in the development of the school 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.800
 Peter Schuller the delegate he responsibility and so are colleagues too 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.740
 Affected by the content another point was the training 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.360
 the new culprit is similar to us is the whole school 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.030
 capture and there I think Weeze to jerk through a college 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.460
 From the point of view of the students, we find that a higher motivation in the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.050
 Lessons take place in that they learn more responsibility for their own 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.110
 to get 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 Our goal is very clear Elmar Weiler 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.360
 with above 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.850
 to empower students to learn the lifelong learning that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.850
 Erlanger self-tax Cel 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 want them 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690
 LG for the phones 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.359
 what you for example keep your head 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.880
 then, for example, there is no one on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.670
 the national player proved that not only is real money working 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
 at other places 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.629
 brought as many changes as Jule 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.900
 but also across schools in the educational region as the self-employed 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.050
 School we have the experience that this rethink is worth it 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.200
 is worthwhile 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.140
 Percent led the students for the parents for the college also for the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.129
 principal 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.580
 Incidentally, who is also the overall percent for the educational region in the 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.799
 Cooperation with the other schools and school types 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.669
 So innovation projects aimed at percent by one 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.180
 Reinforcement of methodological skills and media skills because the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.359
 Pupil being able to move more independently under self-employment 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.919
 to learn 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.590
 we have one again 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.969
 Computers of our school with the elaborate and laptops 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.339
 I also think that only studies frame important component for the upper school 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.039
 is because you can learn it yourself and also in the media 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.229
 means you can nose it as in the riparian forest coined try I think 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.559
 this is also 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.099
 partly so that the students are educated to become independent 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.499
 means you have to look at the clock yourself and drag along your own devices 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 bypass 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.289
 ca 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.230
 we take the castle school in the hand 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.479
 we could experiment 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.439
 and we also could our Sofia 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.309
 Personnel prefer 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.079
 Maître softened her breast 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.099
 more targeted and so closer 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.099
 we brought operating team close to school 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:16.649
 This is an experience for the students they did not have before 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:21.939
 Now we have set up factories, each student is tied to the 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.419
 operating experience 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.130
 Operating experience at the operated outside 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.009
 but also here 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.750
 and guilds have joined Cameron 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.020
 but they supported that »of course there were fears 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.750
 only changes include fears 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.850
 but by the fact that this was always based on the common ground on the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.580
 Themes work was designed to be this alone 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.129
 not he alone who before that does not exist here with that is an essential one 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.310
 Point of everyone who goes on this way 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.539
 also a great hope 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.830
 really to work with others yes unfortunately 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.889
 I will miss everyone 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.069
 To take advantage of continuing education courses that go to the lesson development 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.659
 but the training should be 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.830
 not related to individual teachers but they should say team-oriented 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.469
 we should capture the whole system and the men way the whole school 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:25.189
 because only then does it have a lasting effect sda so it would be important that the colleagues 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.720
 make that percent new tackle OK bring that willingness percent 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.650
 if this new specify 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.230
 and that the conditions you find are also very suitable 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.939
 to act independently 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.119
 that is, the conditions that must be set by the policy suitable 

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.600
 his 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.150
 self-acting act also let 2 2 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.790
 as crucial as it is 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.550
 that you also have yourself in mind as headmaster, for example 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.300
 we have to look now he needs a way 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 or as a supervisor sometimes let go Chur 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.289
 and say something stolen there too 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.080
 and do not want to down the line everything 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.129
 there happened quite unbelievably noticed it creates own processes
