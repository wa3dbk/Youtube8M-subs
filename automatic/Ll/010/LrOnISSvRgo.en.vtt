00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that's was going to ask is it easier

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.640 
that's was going to ask is it easier
when<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> play<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.970> guys<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> know

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
when you play with guys that you know

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.020 
when you play with guys that you know
you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> guess<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.490> depends<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you know I guess it kind of depends I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
you know I guess it kind of depends I
personally<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> play

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
personally think that when I play

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.230 
personally think that when I play
against<00:01:20.250> players<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.119> they're

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
against players that know what they're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.609 
against players that know what they're
doing<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.659> feel<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.140> game<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> better

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
doing I feel like my game is better

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
doing I feel like my game is better
suited<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.299> when

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
suited for that because you know when

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
suited for that because you know when
people<00:01:24.659> aren't<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.290> sure<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.799> they're<00:01:26.009> doing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
people aren't so sure what they're doing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.649 
people aren't so sure what they're doing
then<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.640> hard<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.939> me<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> figure<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.479> what

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
then it's hard for me to figure out what

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.760 
then it's hard for me to figure out what
