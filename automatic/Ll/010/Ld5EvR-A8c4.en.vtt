00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.360 

I've<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.200> playing<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.680> well<00:00:43.800> since<00:00:44.190> the

I've been playing really well since the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
I've been playing really well since the
past<00:00:44.579> two<00:00:44.910> years<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.870> made<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> maximum<00:00:46.500> in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

past two years and I made a maximum in
practice<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> thought<00:00:47.850> why<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.060> give<00:00:48.360> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
practice then I thought why not give it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.890 
practice then I thought why not give it
a<00:00:48.540> chance

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
a chance

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.170 
a chance
why<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.500> played<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.640> interest<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
why not played with more interest so I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
why not played with more interest so I
started<00:00:51.450> playing<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:51.870> regularly<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> started

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
started playing more regularly I started

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
started playing more regularly I started
practicing<00:00:53.100> six<00:00:53.370> eight<00:00:53.550> hours<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> day<00:00:53.879> took

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
practicing six eight hours a day took

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.780 
practicing six eight hours a day took
the<00:00:54.720> year<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.260> work<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> heard<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
the year off from work then I heard that

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.670 
the year off from work then I heard that
body<00:00:57.059> run<00:00:57.330> is<00:00:57.480> coming<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> Q<00:00:58.410> schools

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
school in general see I think it's a

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.500 
school in general see I think it's a
great<00:04:30.320> chance<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> great<00:04:30.980> idea<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.640> also

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
great chance is a great idea and also

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.000 
great chance is a great idea and also
not<00:04:32.690> just<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.050> new<00:04:33.170> the<00:04:33.350> new<00:04:33.380> guys<00:04:33.680> they<00:04:33.830> want

not just the new the new guys they want
to<00:04:34.100> get<00:04:34.190> into<00:04:34.340> her<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:35.450> guy

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.360 
they've got a chance to get straight
back<00:04:38.720> on<00:04:38.960> again<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.350> it's<00:04:39.440> really<00:04:39.560> good<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.160> in

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
back on again so it's really good and in

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.430 
back on again so it's really good and in

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.530 
terms of the global appeal or dr. o
certainly<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.340> proof<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.180> but<00:04:44.390> there

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
certainly is proof of that but there

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.170 
certainly is proof of that but there
must<00:04:44.750> be<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:44.960> whole<00:04:45.320> army<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.890> Chinese<00:04:46.880> players
