made you mad right so what I'm gonna get
out<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> key

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
out here is is the you know the the key

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670 
out here is is the you know the the key
concept<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.119> let's<00:01:42.450> let's<00:01:42.750> focus<00:01:43.380> on

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
concept is when you let's let's focus on

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.370 
concept is when you let's let's focus on
like<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> second<00:01:44.729> example<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> guess

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
like the on the second example I guess

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
like the on the second example I guess
so<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.950> someone<00:01:47.220> cuts<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so you know someone cuts you off and you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.749 
so you know someone cuts you off and you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
say that guy cut me off he flipped me

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.270 
say that guy cut me off he flipped me
off<00:01:50.820> he<00:01:51.270> made<00:01:51.509> me<00:01:51.659> mad<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> key

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
off he made me mad right so the key

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
off he made me mad right so the key
point<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.060> look<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.860> he<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:57.060> retrospect

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
point is to look at he in retrospect

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
point is to look at he in retrospect
whoever<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.979> person<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
whoever that person was and this is just

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
whoever that person was and this is just
an<00:02:00.420> example<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> course<00:02:01.070> he<00:02:02.070> didn't<00:02:02.520> actually

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
an example of course he didn't actually

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
an example of course he didn't actually
make<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.570> mad<00:02:03.810> he<00:02:04.649> didn't<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.040> do

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
make you mad he didn't really do

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
off which I'm not saying was a good

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.300 
off which I'm not saying was a good
thing<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.739> saying<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.069> all

thing to do I'm just saying that's all

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.710 
thing to do I'm just saying that's all
he<00:02:11.459> really<00:02:11.580> did<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.940> cut<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.239> off<00:02:12.390> flipped

and kept going on throughout his day
right<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.280> theory<00:02:17.730> he<00:02:18.150> didn't<00:02:18.620> really<00:02:19.620> in

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right in in theory he didn't really in

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.479 
right in in theory he didn't really in
any<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:21.000> make<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.260> feel<00:02:22.680> mad

what happened is you decided to get mad

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.860 
what happened is you decided to get mad

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
because of his actions you I guess you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
because of his actions you I guess you
could<00:02:30.989> say<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.500> let<00:02:31.950> him<00:02:32.129> make<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.489> mad<00:02:32.700> even

the<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:01.980> all<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.670> subconscious

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
the time it's all on the subconscious

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.259 
the time it's all on the subconscious
level<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:04.709> know<00:03:04.829> once<00:03:05.340> especially<00:03:05.790> yeah<00:03:06.150> I

think<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.690> easiest<00:03:07.019> things<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.409> say<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:08.129> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
think the easiest things to say like to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.369 
think the easiest things to say like to
distinguish<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:10.049> things<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
distinguish this as are just things that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.030 
distinguish this as are just things that
piss<00:03:10.920> us<00:03:11.129> off<00:03:12.049> because<00:03:13.049> it's<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.620> easy<00:03:13.650> to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
piss us off because it's just so easy to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.300 
piss us off because it's just so easy to
blame<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.400> other<00:03:14.549> things<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:16.409> in<00:03:16.590> reality

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
blame it on other things and in reality

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.470 
blame it on other things and in reality
you're<00:03:17.489> deciding<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.989> mad<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.260> your<00:03:19.620> own

I'm gonna keep it real and I'm just

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.390 
I'm gonna keep it real and I'm just
gonna<00:05:32.120> keep<00:05:32.360> going<00:05:32.420> through<00:05:32.810> my<00:05:32.900> day<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.410> you

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
gonna keep going through my day and you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.510 
gonna keep going through my day and you
know<00:05:34.490> that<00:05:34.670> applies<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:34.970> to<00:05:36.100> every<00:05:37.100> emotion

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
know that applies to to every emotion

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.190 
know that applies to to every emotion
you<00:05:37.610> can<00:05:37.760> think<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.420> have<00:05:38.570> control

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
you can think of that you have control

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.220 
you can think of that you have control
over<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.850> personally<00:05:41.360> think<00:05:41.480> that<00:05:41.810> having

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
over and I personally think that having

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.040 
over and I personally think that having
that<00:05:42.730> strength<00:05:43.730> to<00:05:44.330> just<00:05:44.780> make<00:05:44.870> that<00:05:44.900> decision

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
that strength to just make that decision

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.250 
that strength to just make that decision
for<00:05:45.530> yourself<00:05:45.590> is<00:05:46.480> it's<00:05:47.480> really<00:05:47.900> hard<00:05:48.140> to

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
for yourself is it's really hard to

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.470 
for yourself is it's really hard to
acquire<00:05:48.560> but<00:05:48.620> if<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.220> can<00:05:49.370> get<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.730> or<00:05:49.940> if<00:05:50.390> you

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
acquire but if you can get it or if you

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.750 
acquire but if you can get it or if you
can<00:05:50.630> at<00:05:51.050> least<00:05:51.160> practice<00:05:52.160> it<00:05:52.340> and<00:05:52.490> get<00:05:52.640> better

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
can at least practice it and get better

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.350 
can at least practice it and get better
every<00:05:52.910> day<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:54.260> will<00:05:54.980> help<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.970> guys<00:05:56.120> have<00:05:56.330> a
