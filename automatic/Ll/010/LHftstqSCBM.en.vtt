00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.619
 liu the world will yield on stocks 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.759
 you have fine then today for 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.529
 a video 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.890
 and what a video a new trick 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.290
 camin is the technical setbacks of 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.910
 borker chips by cons by good I know 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.079
 not if you also know people 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.730
 have made a video on it but it's a 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.070
 city the technique parents I used 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.880
 when I was little then we go 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.870
 immediately take 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.670
 let's go take some 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.320
 2022 chips we go directly to apps 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.809
 and where are we going will go will get 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.329
 return to the throne fair there that 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.329
 sit here so it's the greens do the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.489
 -11 -40 we're going to see a NPC 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.949
 was going to exchange his chips randomly 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.630
 against items or against a 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.460
 protection to the users of the village heart 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.220
 so again there's a lot of 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.290
 luck so it's the rocky plains 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.960
 I think that is right yeah 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.000
 that's it then the entry here is by 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 down is the very bottom we are not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.039
 there is no passage on them on 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.229
 sides as you see here from the 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.810
 fair of the throne you can find 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.520
 also the dungeon it seems to me that it's 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.530
 the ghost train or something like that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.450
 but hey it's not it's not the most 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.840
 interesting here we will change them 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.170
 directly to the pnj our little tokens 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.000
 I hope we'll be lucky he'll 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.490
 we trade and of course against 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.979
 items of the breakdown also if we have the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.020
 chance and we will be able to resell them on 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.780
 looked a little bit the most 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.670
 interesting is the ring because 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.229
 here is the ring that is worth 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
 near 300 common miles on my server 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.130
 so if we have one that falls 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.170
 I'm really happy but here we are 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:07.039
 it's cool the cape and the cap not good 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.080
 are worth about one hundred thousand 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.709
 so for the headdress his 100 miles on 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 my server and the 4c 125000 and he's me 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.840
 seems we can also have the mussel 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.760
 the amulet it costs about 150 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.760
 miles to know that if you want the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.230
 crushed you will have a gap rune has 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120
 again with a little bit of 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.170
 luck she really has a lot of 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 chance to fall if you want us to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.150
 breakage and 7.7 amulets that's pretty much 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.690
 70% it seems to me it's not bad 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.379
 interesting 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.970
 and so here we go speed we go 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.019
 change our our two tokens 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.220
 I am hurting myself because 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.069
 I took like another khadir for 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.380
 the hop hop hop way to the graulhetois 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.100
 your taste buds 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.320

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.950

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.770
 in the area 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.510
 I think it is above it is 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.280
 easy to find him because he has a 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.550
 kind of big jeans machine just 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.930

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.260
 of hot disks what is she going to do 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.330
 a search on faster bork 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.930

 voiceover 100000 cam has so already 4000 cases 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.600
 my decoration of 40000 kama to win at 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.460
 the sale we will put it to 99 thousand 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.470
 stories that feel faster on 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.380
 do not care about the jet 1 the principle will be done 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.640
 it is to make money in hotels of 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.260
 sale we also want directly to 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.300
 the hotel in front of shoemakers to buy 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.020
 so we'll take this clip from 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.030
 bourque chef 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.840
 we will also go to drink we are not going to 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.040
 to fuck boss bork 100000 cam so 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.480
 here for example you also have the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.820
 good ben boots if you have the boots 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.250
 you will receive a smaller amount of pao 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.550
 of profits so there is also 99 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.130
 miles 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.540
 that's just the technique 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.340
 walk at any level for the little that you 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.320
 have something to invest so there 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.420
 you see the chips I paid them 60 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.150
 thousand camin 120 thousand executives invested and 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.060
 for sale two hundred thousand cammas so 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.350
 80000 profit camin on resale 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.240
 it's all we run it's rather 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.580
 interesting and it allows people who 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.680
 do not have a lot of kama of power 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 how is this technique so here I am 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.350
 I make you poles I hope that 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.350
 you're going to be kidding go ciao buddies
