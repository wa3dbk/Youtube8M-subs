which<00:01:25.680> helps<00:01:26.009> their<00:01:26.130> digestion<00:01:26.540> cut<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
which helps their digestion cut is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.160 
which helps their digestion cut is
basically<00:01:28.170> food<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.220> being<00:01:29.400> regurgitated

basically food that's being regurgitated
goats<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.380> core<00:01:31.710> compartments<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> their

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
goats have core compartments to their

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.810 
goats have core compartments to their
stomach<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> cud<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.159> brought<00:01:35.430> back<00:01:35.579> up

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
stomach so the cud is brought back up

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
stomach so the cud is brought back up
for<00:01:36.119> further<00:01:36.329> chewing<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.170> push<00:01:37.560> back

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
for further chewing and then push back

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.990 
for further chewing and then push back
down<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.159> their<00:01:38.280> stomach<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.759> further

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
down in their stomach for further

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.950 
down in their stomach for further
digestion<00:01:39.650> our<00:01:40.650> goats<00:01:40.979> natural<00:01:41.520> climbers<00:01:41.960> Jos

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
digestion our goats natural climbers Jos

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
digestion our goats natural climbers Jos
originated<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> mountainous<00:01:44.220> areas<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.970> they

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
originated in mountainous areas so they

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
originated in mountainous areas so they
really<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> climb<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:46.799> will

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
really do like to climb they will

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
really do like to climb they will
basically<00:01:47.159> try<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> anything<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
basically try to get on anything so
