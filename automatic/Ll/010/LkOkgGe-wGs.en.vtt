hello that's the telescope is it'll be
good<00:00:13.950> yeah<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.880> bad<00:00:15.109> that's<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.350> 8-inch

down<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.719> equatorial<00:00:33.719> lineman<00:00:34.940> there's<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
down the equatorial lineman there's a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.420 
down the equatorial lineman there's a
box<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.510> pieces<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.829> kill<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> light

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
box of my pieces and if I kill the light

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
box of my pieces and if I kill the light
you'll<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> leave<00:00:39.600> oops<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.920> kill<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you'll see you leave oops if I kill the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.150 
you'll see you leave oops if I kill the
light<00:00:46.520> like<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.559> you'll<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
light like that you'll see that the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.930 
light like that you'll see that the
telescope<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.969> pointing<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.280> Venus<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.670> then

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
telescope is pointing a Venus and then

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
telescope is pointing a Venus and then
up<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.610> we<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> moon<00:00:57.739> if<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.920> sort<00:00:59.340> out

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
up here we have the moon if I sort out

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.210 
up here we have the moon if I sort out
the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.900 

the<00:01:02.310> exposure<00:01:03.240> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> moon<00:01:05.090> oops<00:01:06.320> having<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
the exposure on the moon oops having a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.310 
the exposure on the moon oops having a
takedown<00:01:08.910> as<00:01:09.300> much<00:01:09.480> as<00:01:09.660> we<00:01:09.810> came<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
takedown as much as we came to see the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.860 
takedown as much as we came to see the
moon<00:01:10.560> saw<00:01:10.890> half<00:01:11.160> phase<00:01:11.550> if<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.570> tell<00:01:12.720> me

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
moon saw half phase if I tell me

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.270 
moon saw half phase if I tell me
although<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> hope<00:01:13.470> you'll<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.800> see<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
although I hope you'll actually see the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.190 
although I hope you'll actually see the
earth<00:01:14.400> shown<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> dark<00:01:15.180> side<00:01:15.480> of<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.600> moon

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.750 

anyway<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.620> ignoring<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.610> got

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
anyway so ignoring that then we got

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.240 
anyway so ignoring that then we got
Venus<00:01:23.240> for<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.900> over<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.320> yeah<00:01:25.500> those

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
Venus for you all over there yeah those

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
Venus Venus the head to the eyepiece you

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:52.249 
Venus Venus the head to the eyepiece you
say<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:47.780> was<00:01:48.780> young<00:01:49.080> oh<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.020> leave<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259

that's<00:02:02.189> good<00:02:03.320> either<00:02:04.320> way<00:02:04.439> ignoring<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's good either way ignoring the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.819 
that's good either way ignoring the
chromatic<00:02:05.850> aberration<00:02:06.450> that's<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> funny

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
chromatic aberration that's the funny

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.190 
chromatic aberration that's the funny
color<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.310> side<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.090> blow<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.959> side

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
color on one side and they blow one side

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
color on one side and they blow one side
the<00:02:10.349> last<00:02:10.530> good<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> Venus

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the last good you see that Venus

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.729 
the last good you see that Venus
basically<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.989> same<00:02:13.020> shape<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
basically in the same shape as the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:27.830 
basically in the same shape as the
that's<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.670> main<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.479

well let so here we have these three
very<00:03:54.180> conscious<00:03:54.780> two<00:03:54.960> craters<00:03:55.440> whose<00:03:56.240> name

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
very conscious two craters whose name

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.360 
very conscious two craters whose name
I've<00:03:57.710> long<00:03:58.710> since<00:03:59.250> forgotten<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:02.160> then

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
everything right the main is at

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.030 
everything right the main is at
different<00:04:04.140> times<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:06.380> Luna<00:04:07.380> des<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.830> turns

different times of the Luna des it turns
out<00:04:08.190> within<00:04:08.460> a<00:04:08.520> month<00:04:08.730> then<00:04:08.940> really<00:04:09.150> mad<00:04:09.300> at

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
out within a month then really mad at

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.630 
out within a month then really mad at
which<00:04:09.570> they're<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> same<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:11.160> see<00:04:11.340> different

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
which they're the same you see different

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.280 
which they're the same you see different
things<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.770> just<00:04:14.690> towards<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> Terminator

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
things and just towards the Terminator

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.870 
things and just towards the Terminator
and<00:04:17.420> actually<00:04:18.420> all<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> cameras<00:04:19.049> today

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and actually all the cameras today

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.039 
and actually all the cameras today
there's<00:04:20.880> what<00:04:21.270> something<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.690> looks<00:04:21.840> really

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
there's what something that looks really

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.380 
there's what something that looks really
convincingly<00:04:22.680> like<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.980> sword<00:04:25.940> by<00:04:26.940> any<00:04:27.120> good<00:04:27.300> to

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
convincingly like a sword by any good to

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.000 
convincingly like a sword by any good to
see<00:04:27.540> these<00:04:27.690> things<00:04:27.900> were<00:04:28.110> relatively<00:04:28.650> short

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
see these things were relatively short

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.370 
see these things were relatively short
periods<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.370> time<00:04:29.690> when<00:04:30.690> they<00:04:30.810> actually<00:04:30.960> cast

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
periods of time when they actually cast

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.510 
periods of time when they actually cast
shadows<00:04:32.300> after<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:33.630> shall<00:04:33.840> lose<00:04:34.140> them

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
shadows after that you shall lose them

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.140 
shadows after that you shall lose them
lose<00:04:35.520> them<00:04:35.730> in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.040> brightness<00:04:38.850> oh

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
mid down the moon of course there are no

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:57.550 
mid down the moon of course there are no
shadows<00:04:52.250> look<00:04:53.250> at<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.580> aha<00:04:54.750> yeah

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
much in fact on this magnification I'm

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.240 
much in fact on this magnification I'm
gonna<00:05:18.639> try<00:05:18.909> and<00:05:19.030> find<00:05:19.740> she<00:05:20.740> first<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.159> all

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
gonna try and find she first of all

let's go up to thee well this is good

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.679 
let's go up to thee well this is good
saying<00:05:25.979> that's<00:05:26.979> like<00:05:27.310> uber<00:05:27.789> magnification

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
saying that's like uber magnification

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.080 
saying that's like uber magnification
there

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:47.760 

I'm<00:05:33.660> just<00:05:33.900> going<00:05:34.080> to<00:05:34.110> come<00:05:34.350> across<00:05:34.699> matter<00:05:35.699> now

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.520 

I<00:05:47.860> think<00:05:48.550> that's<00:05:48.669> it<00:05:48.849> laughs<00:05:49.289> that's<00:05:50.289> the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
I think that's it laughs that's the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.300 
I think that's it laughs that's the
Scimitar

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310

to the full Blart and then just off to

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.870 
to the full Blart and then just off to
the<00:05:59.300> side<00:05:59.390> we<00:05:59.780> have<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.080> use<00:06:00.280> these<00:06:01.280> very

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.850 
the side we have to use these very
characteristic<00:06:02.720> three<00:06:02.990> cret<00:06:03.260> is<00:06:03.410> almost<00:06:03.650> in

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
characteristic three cret is almost in
