00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.760
 after knowing the play 4 came the 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.790
 turn of the microsoft novelty that 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.500
 introduced the xbox one this new machine 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.610
 has an 8 amd cores processor 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.430
 of 8 gigas of ram usb 3.0 reader of 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.070
 bluray and rigid 500 gigs plus 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.660
 They say it is very quiet as 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.610
 interesting is that besides playing the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.380
 xbox one is posed as a device 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.810
 complete multimedia touch stage 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.880
 yes, nines 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.010
 can be used to talk on Skype 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.980
 and will connect to a decoder the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 cable TV also to control the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 change of channels 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.770
 giorgi 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 wow 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.780
 just like play 4 will allow us 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.800
 run games of the previous generation 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.440
 in this case of the xbox 360 and there are also 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.480
 another novelty discs only 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.060
 would serve to install the game in the 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.979
 console this is a move to try 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.140
 slow down the market for the sale of games 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.660
 second hand that by the way is every time 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.640
 most popular anyway the game 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.680
 will be tied to the user that even 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 I could loan it but to use it 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.600
 two people at a time you could ask for a 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.580
 payment going back to the console in addition to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.770
 the games will have applications based 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.750
 in windows 8 the option to browse 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.180
 Internet and improvements in the kinect system 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.310
 that will detect more movements like the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 twist of the wrist and even the beats 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 from the heart 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.780
 to play online microsoft announced that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.220
 there will be 300 xbox live servers 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.710
 videos of the games can be saved 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.320
 in the cloud and the hosting also brings 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.020
 some modifications but it does not seem 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.180
 be nothing too drastic as it is in 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 relation to play 4 on the papers and 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.200
 only with the information that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.720
 they shared both companies look very 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.890
 similar both have the same heart 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.270
 of 8 aemead cores and 8 gigas of ram 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.190
