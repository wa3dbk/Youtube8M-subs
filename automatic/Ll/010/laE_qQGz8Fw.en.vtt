00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.529
 I thought of the first is the ne Lucas film is due to Disney or let's go from there 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.529
 In acquisition 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.130
 tee 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.970
 I think No way I Lucasfilm and George Lucas get the Lucas film 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.950
 It was not 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.670
 What I George Lucas clearly saying the Tteyuu Kedomo I think betrayal is 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.289
 Probably 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:33.520
 Twentieth Century Fox When Making The First Star Wars Latest 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:39.250
 Their own so as not to made sequel to something that the head 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:43.629
 In order to make the movie I wanted to make since I was a thought and street children fight in Independent 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:48.610
 Because making the I mean Lucas film without Morawa hardly any guarantee in between and moisturizing 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.310
 The merchandising is said without being scrapped , the right from the merchandising toy 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.900
 To 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:01:00.200
 I cut the rights of the sequel and sequel to myself and made the film 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:03.830
 Bidan was was I'm In that sense, I 1970, the American film resurrected it to us now 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.970
 I feel like Hollywood is the center of the movie Honma movie, but 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.970
 Line I era it's not like that Hollywood was the center of the movie 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:22.910
 It is only in the years after the year but in fact it is about 1950 50 years to 1970 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.740
 Europe was the center of the film for quite some time 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.560
 Hollywood is nothing but cheap for making any film with the lighting of that bad film 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 So 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 It looks like it's old 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 sound 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.549
 It was ok that I was back 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.710
 It's old, it's that movie bread, especially people in their 40's, 50's and 60's 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 Speaking of the director 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 Hideaki Ogino generation color is about 40 years old so I 'm out of it already and I am 1 year old with me and you 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:02.850
 I think he is 50 people 23 this year because it is a difference, but he is about that color 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.700
 It is becoming an American film when saying a movie, but it is a generation of the lovable guard on it 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.470
 If you see from the beginning 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.879
 A is generally that the sedan soldiers of all European Film After one sound one saw the Tteyuu generation 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.670
 I think I talk hotly 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:17.660
 After it is Toka that Fellini 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.140
 Well what in the Catherine Deneuve or the You're Oh land of whether the Hocha 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.970
 It's so and say why or even there in that era Abou 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.430
 Era really was the center of the movie Once Tsu like out in Europe say the center of the movie of that era 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:33.000
 Lasted about 30 people 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.920
 The it is the United States of Hollywood movies is back doing Yong 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 The top figure of Steven Spielberg was hit by George and it became George 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.590
 I'm a Star Wars guy from Lucas 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.930
 Nickname as I in Spielberg genius boy 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.990
 Enters stuck in the studio made because his writer of in large capital 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.689
 Soccer, so-called businessman, entertainer and artist 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:03.790
 In that sense, that series of Alfred Hitchcock 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.950
 I think I'm a writer, while George Lucas is completely football 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.569
 That says it should be independent 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.250
 We are in the Francis Ford Coppola Toka that flow to after it is Toka John Boorman 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:18.159
 I was an artist. 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.530
 That person is what you can see in sf movies for children, such as Steveo himself 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:25.069
 Making 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:28.910
 The sequel sequel to the sequel has always been without the influence of the result popscalar, that is the influence of the great teacher 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.709
 I made my favorite work without being influenced by the bank or 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.780
 Subsequent banged make trilogy in 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.440
 When 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:46.590
 All six of Star Wars's 123 have been created to become the previous work in the era of the previous work 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.970
 The Kaneko people have all the studios and the Kaneko people have all invested to make the work. 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.490
 Because I could style it 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.500
 Because 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.560
 That's right now 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.710
 The anime called Evangelion is 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.110
 The company named Color that you have &amp; is making 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.910
 Quite different from that in which it is is of the tv version of Evangelion and the theater version now ordinal broken sudden 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.750
 It has been made in four 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.520
 As for Laber , Evangelion also invested in TV Tokyo and King Records. 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.560
 Gainax Among that made investment in the Te 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.590
 I did not give money but I was carrying out part of the policy in such a way 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.750
 Ano you make a company called color 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:28.490
 It's almost like those previous relationships in making the Evangelion movie version 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.510
 I'm not about to say that cut your hands down really the influence of their own 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.210
 Because Evangelion is as easy to make great 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:39.910
 Well, this is very similar to how to make Star Wars, so I can do that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.820
 The fact that I'm doing all over the world also I artist 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:50.820
 Studio Ghibli also that so Studio Ghibli also from the various places 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:55.200
 Though it receives investment by the production committee method, it makes family goods garden of what makes Ogen 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.650
 Flop is holding all Yappa like Lucasfilm is because of either made no Kano right 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.650
 I'm standing this way 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:08.030
 So if this Disney buys Luca Spiron for me 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.889
 Yes I'm such that uh that is independent UK Independent 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.000
 Force to say 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:17.639
 Well, if you look at this Nico, you will probably understand it, but 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.880
 I use the word "independent" at the time of explanation to an uncle, aunt, etc. 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.080
 Wow 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:29.340
 Small company I make private store pop make 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:33.930
 What is the way, but in the end 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.660
 Somewhere it's become to me by what was to sell off on major capital 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:42.520
 that 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.520
 Because some kind of person maybe 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:52.889
 Steve Jobs by iphone 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:56.639
 After giving up some worth of Apple 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.120
 On the contrary, it seems to be acquired by some company 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.720
 What a shop like that 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.650
 After all because now it says Chau N face of filtered water 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.540
 Walt Disney 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:12.760
 Has come out also comment that I thought likely that the sequel make So Well I will not have the United States 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.920
 Say that the wound on long after the 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.660
 Hey, I do not know be so 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:23.290
 Though there was a good comment now as a way of thinking 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.360
 Toli Masu successor car Inasa Somura 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:34.090
 Star Wars after that I tried to epic Lucas So I had retired after all 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.940
 Also we would not have human beings leave the right after all and say whether the left to everyone Luke spill 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.800
 After all 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.850
 If I'm going to make a change, I 'll leave it to my brother for a while, and I wonder what's going on 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.230
 I think about it 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:49.550
 Because And then another Disney has announced that create a Star Wars 7 without putting missing a beat 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:51.620
 This is also not the purpose of making 7 of the star lord 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:57.889
 As a Disney company 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:58.520
 Is was it is in the poor so much what's sales of finished had recently smoked in gold 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.229
 The 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.400
 Disney 's entertainment is very much like entertainment for children 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.970
 I've extended it 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.610
 Decent cg animation in also I'm making at Toka Pixar 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:17.819
 If it is this way, it may be hijacked by the body of the movie production towards Pixar 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:21.870
 That 's why I have two more companies in that sense 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:27.419
 I want to make all the content that comes out softly come from Disneyland 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.630
 The say and do You're the former I think there is a big of the content industry stout-hearted rather than filmmaking 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.000
 so 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:34.050
 So good 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.080
 It is pretty good decision because Haba Lucas film car say I buy pose of strike 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:42.080
 I think but I think it is worthwhile to be able to get rid of the original 7 stars 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:55.800
