cast<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:10.659> you<00:03:11.560> might<00:03:11.739> want<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:11.980> round<00:03:12.280> down<00:03:12.400> to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
cast on you might want to round down to

that will make it easier to decrease

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.160 
that will make it easier to decrease
later<00:03:18.390> rounding<00:03:19.390> down<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.780> better<00:03:19.959> than

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
later rounding down is better than

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.990 
later rounding down is better than
rounding<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.650> because<00:03:21.010> 1/2<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.579> tiny
