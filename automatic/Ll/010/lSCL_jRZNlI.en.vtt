sending<00:01:40.110> me<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> prototype<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.670> went<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sending me a prototype and we went in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.990 
sending me a prototype and we went in
and<00:01:42.990> made<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:44.520> compact

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and made it a little bit more compact

and made it a little bit more compact
and<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.780> are<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:46.020> easy<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:47.600> by<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> EM

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and they are more easy to use by the EM

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there's cool of course in theory you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
there's cool of course in theory you
could<00:02:03.060> also<00:02:03.360> fully<00:02:03.570> automate<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:05.189> yeah

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
could also fully automate that but yeah

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.059 
could also fully automate that but yeah
it's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:05.969> simple<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.930> fairly<00:02:07.560> cost

it's a really simple and fairly cost

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.010 
it's a really simple and fairly cost
efficient<00:02:08.610> design<00:02:09.000> doesn't<00:02:09.479> need<00:02:09.750> many

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
efficient design doesn't need many

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.970

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
to go this way we have to build it like

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.970 
to go this way we have to build it like
this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.810 
this
so<00:02:59.520> put<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.450> slime<00:03:00.690> blocks<00:03:00.990> down<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.820> also

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
so put your slime blocks down and also

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.840 
so put your slime blocks down and also
in<00:03:02.940> front<00:03:03.270> hoop<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.170> need<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.100> little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.640> of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
in front hoop you need a little bit of

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.590 
in front hoop you need a little bit of
piston<00:03:06.570> action<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.230> normal<00:03:07.650> piston<00:03:07.830> there<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
piston action so normal piston there and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.520 
piston action so normal piston there and
on<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.720> other<00:03:09.750> side<00:03:10.170> put<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.160> piston<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.120> well

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
on the other side put a piston as well

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.070 
on the other side put a piston as well
there<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.680> go<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.190> that's<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> basic<00:03:15.480> set<00:03:15.870> up

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
there we go and that's the basic set up

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680 
there we go and that's the basic set up
now<00:03:16.410> hook<00:03:17.040> up<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.370> power<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
now hook up the power and if you want to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.980 
now hook up the power and if you want to
test<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.110> out<00:03:19.260> see<00:03:19.970> update<00:03:20.970> update<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:23.990> yeah

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
test it out see update update and yeah

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.590 
test it out see update update and yeah
it<00:03:25.650> would<00:03:25.800> ride<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.910> want<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.210> stop<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
it would ride if you want to stop it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.200 
it would ride if you want to stop it
somebody<00:03:28.530> has<00:03:28.650> an<00:03:28.800> obsidian<00:03:29.040> block<00:03:29.430> yeah<00:03:29.940> I

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
somebody has an obsidian block yeah I

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.770 
somebody has an obsidian block yeah I
just<00:03:30.750> threw<00:03:30.990> mine<00:03:31.170> away<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.180> twice<00:03:33.450> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
just threw mine away this is twice to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.590 
just threw mine away this is twice to
say<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.050> go<00:03:34.140> over<00:03:34.170> put<00:03:35.040> an<00:03:35.130> obsidian<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:36.120> front

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
say we go over put an obsidian in front

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.480 
say we go over put an obsidian in front
and<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.590> stopped<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.220> want<00:03:38.400> to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
and and now it's stopped if you want to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.360 
and and now it's stopped if you want to
make<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.790> go<00:03:39.390> back<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.680> have<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.010> switch

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
make it go back and you have to switch

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.580 
make it go back and you have to switch
two<00:03:41.550> blocks<00:03:41.820> over

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
two blocks over

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.250 
two blocks over
punya<00:03:43.590> can<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.950> please<00:03:44.220> update<00:03:44.460> it<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.260> also

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
punya can you please update it I also

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.130 
punya can you please update it I also
throw<00:03:46.740> I<00:03:46.770> think<00:03:47.070> steal<00:03:47.340> away<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:48.060> yeah<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.630> got

throw I think steal away but yeah I got

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.190 
throw I think steal away but yeah I got
it<00:03:49.260> already<00:03:49.380> here<00:03:50.310> we<00:03:50.400> go<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.080> way

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
it already here we go so this is the way

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.340 
it already here we go so this is the way
back<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.060> how<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.210> would<00:03:54.450> control<00:03:55.080> such

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
back this is how you would control such

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.610 
back this is how you would control such
a<00:03:55.380> setup<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.950> now<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.430> we<00:03:56.880> want<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.150> make<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
a setup and now and we want to make the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.720 
a setup and now and we want to make the
automatic<00:03:58.620> start<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> stop<00:03:59.730> base<00:04:01.400> ok<00:04:02.400> so

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
automatic start and stop base ok so

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.730 
automatic start and stop base ok so
first<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.210> all<00:04:03.330> guys<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.870> need<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.080> determine

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
first of all guys you need to determine

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.930 
first of all guys you need to determine
where<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:04.980> start<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.490> stop

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
where to start and stop

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.050 
where to start and stop
so<00:04:06.240> here<00:04:06.540> start<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.470> stop<00:04:07.680> point<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.700> place

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
so here start and stop point just place

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.180 
so here start and stop point just place
an<00:04:09.300> obsidian<00:04:09.570> block<00:04:09.960> behind<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.620> back

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
an obsidian block behind this back

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.860 
an obsidian block behind this back
piston<00:04:11.700> here<00:04:11.910> if<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.180> want<00:04:12.330> to<00:04:12.420> go<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.660> this

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
piston here if you want to go in this

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.440 
piston here if you want to go in this
direction<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.680> now<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:15.000> need<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.210> do<00:04:15.330> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
direction and now we need to do the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.330 
direction and now we need to do the
starter<00:04:15.810> mechanism<00:04:16.410> which<00:04:16.710> is<00:04:16.799> also<00:04:17.160> really

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
starter mechanism which is also really

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.300 
starter mechanism which is also really
simple<00:04:17.580> just<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.480> normal<00:04:18.840> piston<00:04:19.049> facing<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
simple just a normal piston facing the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.349 
simple just a normal piston facing the
other<00:04:20.489> way<00:04:20.760> around

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
other way around

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.060 
other way around
and<00:04:21.510> then<00:04:22.140> we<00:04:22.290> need<00:04:22.440> two<00:04:22.590> sticky<00:04:22.980> pistons<00:04:23.460> here

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
and then we need two sticky pistons here

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.210 
and then we need two sticky pistons here
go

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
go

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.300 
go
and<00:04:26.900> block<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.620> button<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.160> will

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and block and the button that will

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520 
and block and the button that will
trigger<00:04:29.580> both<00:04:29.850> pistons<00:04:30.720> at<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> same<00:04:31.200> time

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
trigger both pistons at the same time

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.490 
trigger both pistons at the same time
and<00:04:31.800> that's<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.730> that's<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> starter<00:04:33.660> set<00:04:34.320> up

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
and that's it that's the starter set up

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.210 
and that's it that's the starter set up
already

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
already

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460 
already
can<00:04:35.940> go<00:04:36.090> off<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.360> right<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:37.020> then<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:37.320> would

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
can go off and right and then you would

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.320 
can go off and right and then you would
just<00:04:37.500> pick<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.490> know<00:04:38.550> somewhere<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.180> end

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
just pick I don't know somewhere to end

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.030 
just pick I don't know somewhere to end
off<00:04:39.480> your<00:04:39.690> line<00:04:39.870> let's<00:04:40.200> say<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:40.560> going<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.980> be

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
off your line let's say it's going to be

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.600 
off your line let's say it's going to be
here<00:04:41.430> here<00:04:42.330> we<00:04:42.480> go<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.320> make<00:04:44.010> sure<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.340> stop

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
here here we go so make sure the stop

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.030 
here here we go so make sure the stop
block<00:04:44.760> is<00:04:45.000> again<00:04:45.390> behind<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.440> piston<00:04:46.920> and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
block is again behind this piston and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.790 
block is again behind this piston and
then<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.280> just<00:04:47.550> do<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.730> same<00:04:48.030> thing<00:04:48.800> piston

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
then you just do the same thing piston

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.500 
then you just do the same thing piston
facing<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.370> other<00:04:50.490> way<00:04:50.730> around<00:04:50.880> sticky

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
facing the other way around sticky

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.640 
facing the other way around sticky
piston<00:04:52.340> block<00:04:53.340> button<00:04:54.380> combination<00:04:55.380> with

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
piston block button combination with

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.650 
piston block button combination with
another<00:04:55.770> sticky<00:04:56.370> piston<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.880> here<00:04:57.090> if<00:04:57.540> you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
another sticky piston in here if you

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.380 
another sticky piston in here if you
press<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.050> button<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.820> can<00:04:59.820> go<00:04:59.850> in<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.270> other

forward<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.080> little<00:05:49.229> bit<00:05:49.350> but<00:05:49.650> we<00:05:49.860> should<00:05:50.070> be

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
forward a little bit but we should be

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.170 
forward a little bit but we should be
able<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.460> reach<00:05:51.360> it<00:05:51.510> easily<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.900> boat<00:05:52.220> can<00:05:53.220> can

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
able to reach it easily the boat can can

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.150 
able to reach it easily the boat can can
glitch<00:05:54.510> out<00:05:54.780> in<00:05:54.990> very<00:05:55.290> rare<00:05:55.590> cases<00:05:55.620> but

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
glitch out in very rare cases but

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.990 
glitch out in very rare cases but
normally<00:05:56.610> shouldn't<00:05:58.250> there's<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.340> client<00:05:59.669> side

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
normally shouldn't there's a client side

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.670 
normally shouldn't there's a client side
back<00:06:00.270> still<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.780> can<00:06:00.960> sometimes<00:06:01.200> make<00:06:01.650> it

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
back still that can sometimes make it

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.350 
back still that can sometimes make it
look<00:06:01.919> a<00:06:01.950> bit<00:06:02.160> crazy<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.669> you<00:06:02.790> might<00:06:02.970> end<00:06:03.000> up<00:06:03.300> a

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
look a bit crazy and you might end up a

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.810 
look a bit crazy and you might end up a
little<00:06:03.750> bit<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.050> ghost<00:06:04.290> boat<00:06:04.530> mode<00:06:04.830> but<00:06:05.610> other

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
little bit in ghost boat mode but other

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.540 
little bit in ghost boat mode but other
than<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.410> should<00:06:07.410> be<00:06:07.590> simple<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:08.010> replicate

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
than that should be simple to replicate

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.670 
than that should be simple to replicate
