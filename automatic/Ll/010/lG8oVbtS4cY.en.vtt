00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
maybe after watching Holland up on the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.069 
maybe after watching Holland up on the
Rings<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.519> had<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.030> try<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.329> just<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.989> I

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
Rings I had to try it just to see if I

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.140 
Rings I had to try it just to see if I
can<00:02:34.260> hang<00:02:34.409> with<00:02:34.560> spider-man<00:02:35.099> so<00:02:35.879> basically

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
can hang with spider-man so basically

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.819 
can hang with spider-man so basically
what<00:02:36.329> you're<00:02:36.389> gonna<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.689> is<00:02:36.840> grab<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.650> first

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
what you're gonna do is grab the first

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.530 
what you're gonna do is grab the first
ring<00:02:38.159> we're<00:02:38.519> going<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.909> ground<00:02:39.090> whatever

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
ring we're going to the ground whatever

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.539 
ring we're going to the ground whatever
momentum<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.139> can<00:02:40.170> generate<00:02:40.680> right<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
momentum you can generate right now and

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.470 
momentum you can generate right now and
it's<00:02:41.639> gonna<00:02:41.760> come<00:02:41.969> from<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.180> ground<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
it's gonna come from the ground in the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.539 
it's gonna come from the ground in the
beginning<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.319> run<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.099> first<00:02:44.340> one

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
beginning right run up to the first one

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.300 
beginning right run up to the first one
do<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.120> grab<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.389> first<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.829> grab<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
do you grab that first one you grab that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800 
do you grab that first one you grab that
ring<00:02:47.549> turn<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.060> hips<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.419> way<00:02:48.510> around

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
ring turn your hips all the way around

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.569 
ring turn your hips all the way around
and<00:02:48.900> forth<00:02:49.169> toward<00:02:49.709> yourself<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.220> way<00:02:50.400> look

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
and forth toward yourself this way look

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.920 
and forth toward yourself this way look
towards<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.939> bike<00:02:51.120> shop<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.389> pull<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.810> this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
towards the bike shop and pull it this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.199 
towards the bike shop and pull it this
way<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.620> once<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:53.040> get<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.579> art<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:54.090> that

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
way and once you get to the art of that

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.520 
way and once you get to the art of that
swing<00:02:54.540> let<00:02:55.109> go

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
swing let go

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.089 
swing let go
repeat<00:02:56.099> so<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.180> go<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> go<00:02:58.169> down<00:02:58.439> this

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
repeat so here we go so I go down this

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.360 
repeat so here we go so I go down this
way

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
way

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.819 
way
you'll<00:03:00.239> make<00:03:00.419> like<00:03:00.659> that<00:03:00.840> whole<00:03:01.230> one<00:03:01.590> again

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
you'll make like that whole one again

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.690 
you'll make like that whole one again
and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.579> up<00:03:02.939> and<00:03:03.299> then<00:03:03.859> pull<00:03:04.859> there<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.549> get

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and then up and then pull there you get

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.339 
and then up and then pull there you get
off

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
off

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.640 
off
okay<00:03:08.219> all<00:03:08.819> right<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.239> got<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:09.840> now<00:03:10.379> what<00:03:10.590> do

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
okay all right so I got this now what do

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.280

I do
basically<00:03:13.290> that's<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> basics<00:03:14.069> right<00:03:14.219> there

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
basically that's the basics right there

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.670 
basically that's the basics right there
and<00:03:14.790> anything<00:03:15.329> from<00:03:15.629> then<00:03:15.810> on<00:03:16.019> it's<00:03:16.499> gonna<00:03:16.590> be

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
and anything from then on it's gonna be

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.989 
and anything from then on it's gonna be
a<00:03:16.799> little<00:03:17.040> bit<00:03:17.219> more<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.670> know<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.819> can

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:17.999 
a little bit more you know you can

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.000 
a little bit more you know you can
generate<00:03:18.329> body<00:03:18.629> anything<00:03:18.989> from<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.349> body<00:03:19.530> a

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
generate body anything from the body a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.259 
generate body anything from the body a
little<00:03:20.280> bit<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.459> little<00:03:20.609> swing<00:03:20.879> of<00:03:20.999> the<00:03:21.060> hand

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
little bit a little swing of the hand

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.699 
little bit a little swing of the hand
will<00:03:21.689> swing<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:21.989> legs<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.409> little<00:03:22.620> more

in toward your chest
and<00:03:25.739> all<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.280> know<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.639> pieces

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
and all of that you know little pieces

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.890 
and all of that you know little pieces
of<00:03:27.060> your<00:03:27.180> body<00:03:27.359> are<00:03:27.480> going<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.659> generate

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
of your body are going to generate

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.330 
of your body are going to generate
little<00:03:28.170> bits<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.409> momentum<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.859> organs<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.189> get

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
little bits of momentum it organs to get

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.069 
little bits of momentum it organs to get
you<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.519> faster<00:03:29.969> and<00:03:30.090> higher<00:03:30.180> cool<00:03:30.840> so

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
you going faster and higher cool so

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.899 
you going faster and higher cool so
maybe<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.319> can<00:03:31.469> try<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.980> little<00:03:32.370> twist<00:03:32.670> or

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
maybe I can try like a little twist or

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.819 
maybe I can try like a little twist or
yeah<00:03:33.180> how<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.689> once<00:03:34.319> you've<00:03:34.439> let<00:03:34.560> go<00:03:34.709> of

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
yeah how do this once you've let go of

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
yeah how do this once you've let go of
that<00:03:34.919> ring<00:03:35.189> you're<00:03:35.549> gonna<00:03:35.639> open<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.569> hand<00:03:36.780> up

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
that ring you're gonna open this hand up

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.069 
that ring you're gonna open this hand up
swing<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.010> stay<00:03:38.430> tight<00:03:38.669> tight<00:03:39.120> yeah<00:03:39.540> more
