here's<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.170> procedure<00:00:01.439> for<00:00:01.770> bleeding<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
here's the procedure for bleeding the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.090 
here's the procedure for bleeding the
brakes<00:00:02.449> this<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.600> my<00:00:03.750> 96<00:00:04.020> Explorer<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.799> put<00:00:04.950> all

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
brakes this is my 96 Explorer we put all

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.650 
brakes this is my 96 Explorer we put all
new<00:00:05.250> brake<00:00:05.430> lines<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.150> already<00:00:06.299> bled

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
new brake lines on it I already bled

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.730 
new brake lines on it I already bled
three<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.130> four<00:00:08.580> brake<00:00:09.120> lines<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:10.380> first

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
three of the four brake lines so first

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.839 
three of the four brake lines so first
you're<00:00:10.830> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.130> make<00:00:11.250> sure<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.730> your

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
you're going to make sure that your

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.720 
you're going to make sure that your
reservoir<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.660> full<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.530> dot<00:00:14.190> three<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.580> dot

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
reservoir is full with dot three or dot

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.420 
reservoir is full with dot three or dot
4<00:00:14.969> brake<00:00:15.000> fluid<00:00:15.570> whichever<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.430> next

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
4 brake fluid whichever you have next

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.349 
4 brake fluid whichever you have next
you're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> want<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.880> make<00:00:18.000> sure<00:00:18.150> that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you're going to want to make sure that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.000 
you're going to want to make sure that
all<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:20.810> bleeder<00:00:21.810> valves<00:00:22.320> will<00:00:22.740> crack

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
all of the bleeder valves will crack

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
all of the bleeder valves will crack
open<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.090> want<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> go

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
open because you don't want to go

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.939 
open because you don't want to go
through<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> whole<00:00:25.320> procedure<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.859> then

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
through the whole procedure and then

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
through the whole procedure and then
have<00:00:26.099> valves<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.490> won't<00:00:26.670> open<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.300> sure

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
have valves that won't open so make sure

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.820 
have valves that won't open so make sure
you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.599> crack<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.170> loose<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> then

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you can crack all of them loose and then

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.470 
you can crack all of them loose and then
tighten<00:00:29.099> them<00:00:29.189> back<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.390> going

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
tighten them back up then you're going

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.790 
tighten them back up then you're going
to<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> vehicle<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.560> pump

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to want to get in the vehicle and pump

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.870 
to want to get in the vehicle and pump
the<00:00:31.890> brakes<00:00:32.130> until<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.579> meet<00:00:32.730> resistance

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the brakes until you meet resistance

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.970 
the brakes until you meet resistance
usually<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.050> three<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.530> four<00:00:34.739> times

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
usually it's about three or four times

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
usually it's about three or four times
depending<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.610> how<00:00:35.730> much<00:00:35.850> air<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
depending on how much air is in the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
depending on how much air is in the
system<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.440> after<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> pump<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
system and then after you pump the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
system and then after you pump the
brakes<00:00:38.460> three<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.820> four<00:00:38.969> times<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
brakes three or four times you want to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
brakes three or four times you want to
hold<00:00:39.870> resistance<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> pedal<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:42.059> don't

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
hold resistance on the pedal you don't

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.740 
hold resistance on the pedal you don't
want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> let<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:43.910> then<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.420> point

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
want to let off then at that point

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.040 
want to let off then at that point
you're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.170> crack<00:00:46.440> open<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:48.050> bleeder

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you're going to crack open the bleeder

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
you're going to crack open the bleeder
valve<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> pedal<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> go

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
valve and then the pedal is going to go

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
valve and then the pedal is going to go
down<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> floor<00:00:51.660> once<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.350> pedal<00:00:52.620> goes

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
down to the floor once the pedal goes

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
down to the floor once the pedal goes
down<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> floor<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.789> person<00:00:54.090> inside<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
down to the floor the person inside the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
down to the floor the person inside the
vehicle<00:00:54.750> needs<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> let<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> person<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.739> at

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
vehicle needs to let the person know at

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760 
vehicle needs to let the person know at
the<00:00:56.309> valve<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.850> shut<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.320> pump<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the valve to shut it off so you pump the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
the valve to shut it off so you pump the
brakes<00:00:59.010> till<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> meet<00:00:59.579> resistance<00:00:59.670> hold

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
brakes till you meet resistance hold

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
brakes till you meet resistance hold
resistance<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> person<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> valve

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
resistance the person at the valve

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
resistance the person at the valve
cracks<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> valve<00:01:04.019> open<00:01:04.409> once<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> pedal

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
cracks the valve open once the pedal

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.500 
cracks the valve open once the pedal
hits<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> floor<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> want<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> shut<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
hits the floor you want to shut the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.380 
hits the floor you want to shut the
valve<00:01:06.689> before<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> pedal<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.650> released<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
valve before the pedal is released and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.530 
valve before the pedal is released and
then<00:01:09.390> repeat<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> here's<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> procedure

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
then repeat so here's what the procedure

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
then repeat so here's what the procedure
looks<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.140> from<00:01:13.380> outside<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> vehicle<00:01:14.070> once

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
looks like from outside the vehicle once

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.710 
looks like from outside the vehicle once
again<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.180> sure<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.540> brake

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
again you want to make sure your brake

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
again you want to make sure your brake
reservoir<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.290> full<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:19.740> a-goin<00:01:20.130> pump<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
reservoir is full I'm a-goin pump the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.070 
reservoir is full I'm a-goin pump the
brakes<00:01:20.700> he's<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> pump<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> brakes<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
brakes he's going to pump the brakes to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.570 
brakes he's going to pump the brakes to
meets<00:01:22.320> resistance

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.000 

okay<00:01:24.850> let<00:01:25.450> me<00:01:25.480> know<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:26.020> he's<00:01:26.290> my<00:01:26.470> resistance

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
okay let me know that he's my resistance

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.920 
okay let me know that he's my resistance
then<00:01:27.220> I'm<00:01:27.280> going<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.490> crack<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.030> leader<00:01:28.660> valve

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
then I'm going to crack the leader valve

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
then I'm going to crack the leader valve
open<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:30.640> fluids<00:01:30.970> got<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.180> come<00:01:31.330> out<00:01:31.480> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
open some fluids got to come out and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.920 
open some fluids got to come out and
then<00:01:34.150> he<00:01:34.240> didn't<00:01:34.390> let<00:01:34.480> me<00:01:34.570> know<00:01:34.660> it's<00:01:34.780> all<00:01:34.900> the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
then he didn't let me know it's all the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.670 
then he didn't let me know it's all the
way<00:01:35.020> down<00:01:35.050> shut<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.860> off<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:37.050> repeat<00:01:38.050> pump<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
way down shut it off and repeat pump the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.390 
way down shut it off and repeat pump the
brakes
