month<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.980> new<00:00:44.129> workout<00:00:44.460> program<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.030> he

month from new workout program that he

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.930 
month from new workout program that he
tried<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.760> I'm<00:00:48.920> not<00:00:49.920> sure<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> believe<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
tried and I'm not sure I believe it to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
tried and I'm not sure I believe it to
tell<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> truth<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.840> he<00:00:52.020> does<00:00:52.199> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
tell you the truth but he does have

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900 
tell you the truth but he does have
before-and-after<00:00:53.070> pictures<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.640> had<00:00:53.760> very

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
before-and-after pictures he had very

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
before-and-after pictures he had very
well<00:00:54.059> laid<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.520> inclined<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
well laid out and so I'm inclined to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.310 
well laid out and so I'm inclined to
think<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.149> he<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> results

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
think that he really did get the results

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.310 
think that he really did get the results
for<00:00:58.410> himself<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.260> said

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
for himself so I'm going to like I said

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
for himself so I'm going to like I said
make<00:01:01.649> myself<00:01:01.829> elaborate<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> give

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
make myself elaborate I'm going to give

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
make myself elaborate I'm going to give
it<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> try<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.390> well<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.260> scenario<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.830> me

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it a try as well now the scenario for me

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
it a try as well now the scenario for me
is<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> last<00:01:05.850> three<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.570> four
