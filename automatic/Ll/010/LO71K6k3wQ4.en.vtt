00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.730
 jacko txtr.com from 1979 and there are the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
 lorenz peanut lure 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.219
 new and only for a short time again as 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 it would only be a field trial 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.789
 they probably just have it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.410
 brought out 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.189
 so that the junction texter fall into the trap 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.189
 goes and gives his opinion 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.189
 exactly 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.370
 megalomania was to visit no matter if I once 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 which is in it 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 It's 13 percent indicates cattle ranchers 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:49.230
 nice 4 223 fed naturally so well 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.829
 this slide is not so good either 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.850
 It consists of corn and peanut and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.899
 vegetable oil and sweet whey powder 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.629
 smoked aroma garlic butter yes that is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 mix this standard water 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.670
 so maybe it still tastes somehow 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 to taste my garlic on the chip 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 how much more barbecue on facebook 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.159
 It was said that there were also western citizens 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.390
 at mcdonald's 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.649
 took many told my facebook coast 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.850
 I then had that in it that the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.609
 did not taste it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.130
 The barbecue is something you have to 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.850
 knowledge 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:40.329
 You can not really do that 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.329
 or you do not like to taste it 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:57.709
 yes that's nonsense is not a product that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.959
 real nonsense and this 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:05.599
 peanut flavor and the barbecue 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.329
 The fish market does not go together 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:15.530
 that's the one makes you break if 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:18.530
 That's that's the right thing 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.730
 that's a joke, so to speak, the medium 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.359
 this works on potato chips 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.120
 but on peanut chips no point account 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:35.389
 this is pilot and it works 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.519
 not if that does not work 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.380

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.130
 I admit that it is nonsense 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.410
