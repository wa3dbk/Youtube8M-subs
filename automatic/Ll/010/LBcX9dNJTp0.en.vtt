like<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> stream<00:02:16.440> from<00:02:16.739> underneath<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> all

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
like a stream from underneath it so all

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.430 
like a stream from underneath it so all
of<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.830> quenched<00:02:20.459> their<00:02:20.730> thirst<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.510> took<00:02:22.290> a

of them quenched their thirst and took a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.970 
of them quenched their thirst and took a
bath<00:02:23.180> they<00:02:24.180> were<00:02:24.239> all<00:02:24.629> happy<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> live<00:02:25.470> they

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
bath they were all happy to live they

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.729 
bath they were all happy to live they
also<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.670> vector<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.180> bowl<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> place<00:02:28.140> so

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
also a vector a bowl in the place so

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.309 
also a vector a bowl in the place so
that<00:02:29.010> other<00:02:29.540> travelers<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.750> locate<00:02:31.110> the

that other travelers can locate the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.059 
that other travelers can locate the
water<00:02:31.500> source<00:02:32.000> model<00:02:33.799> perseverance<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
water source model perseverance is the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.280 
water source model perseverance is the
key<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.700> success<00:02:36.269> one<00:02:36.810> should<00:02:37.049> try

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
key to success one should try

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.090 
key to success one should try
continuously<00:02:38.129> till<00:02:38.430> he<00:02:38.610> succeeds
