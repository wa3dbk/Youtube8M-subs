00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.790
 Hello, friends, how are you? 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 mate rv is and well if this is going to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.930
 be the last battle that I'm going to raise in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 this year and then he left with one of my 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.410
 good companions of the ones that I have in the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.020
 added in the frame code for defense 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 for each person called sea that 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.189
 we send a greeting that is a user 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.160
 facebook follower of the page 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 facebook and well he asked me if 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 could raise this battle that had 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.070
 against me he takes me to Osuna after 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.699
 I liked it and well let's give it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.699
 play once 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.320
 I said it's fine 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.810
 one of the reasons why I said 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.560
 that it is because I wanted to see something there 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.800
 as a challenger not to see how it is going 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.550
 and good so analyzing the team 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.600
 my partner, I must have a lot 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.370
 careful and I will continue a kind of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.030
 strategy that if you are plan of 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.330
 long ago they know her that is the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.050
 of the team pebbles something very similar 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.150
 but right now is not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.560
 this strategy already with the passage of 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.680
 I have already realized that it is a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.780
 little fragile and a bit unstable at least 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.870
 in this generation it is very difficult 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 follow her 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.290
 so you might be careful 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.880
 and well here the cloud is the one 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 honestly, it 's the one that surprised me the most 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.050
 from this partner almost nobody exploits them 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 and good he defeated my poor key 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.090
 micheletti 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 and nothing happens 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.789
 very well it comes out I like it I like it 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.240
 very much I really like that little 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.439
 sympathetic dragon 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.149
 well then our partner then we 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.160
 we realize that he has a lousy poster 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 and he did pretty well at mimicking acute 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.180
 but if it transforms I say I because I 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.730
 I will also transform or I will do 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.950
 a gross goal 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.319
 so that the atheist mattress that is the male 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 that is march months sheet and cork 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.510
 latero 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.549
 Well, there they are, they are given 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.200
 that is his main job was 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.060
 back to our rivals I say 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.769
 you have seen the strategy of 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.950
 equipment pebbles the battle 1 and the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.480
 battle 2 of the last generation 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.269
 they will surely recognize it very well 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.720
 controlled insists with the light box for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.049
 well apart from harm equal the possibility 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.909
 of a retreat of our rivals 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.120
 it serves quite well and now we see that the 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.150
 division be the dragon and march 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.609
 usa airways said close and I put that no 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.750
 will endure in other blows so now 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.750
 at once it hits all 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:19.500
 nothing happens, hold on 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:22.460
 and in passing the sme increases a little more its 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.460
 Physical attack 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.790
 the dragon game is very good very good 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.200
 even that hurt me I like it a lot 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 we like them a lot very much 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.030
 and well you also have to congratulate him this 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.640
 opponent because judging by the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.129
 resistance of that gross goal good to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 less the care that I have resisted 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.700
 fairly good 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 even from a dragon dance of a dragon 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.640
 so he was already very well trained 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.640
 the metal 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.420
 well now here they try to go back 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:04.840
 we thought they were going to give 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:06.610
 this march and difficult so since 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.770
 I could worry is the goal gross I say 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.890
 spending and apps we give a light blow 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.220
 to put keeps on holding well 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.620
 but it is already 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.040
 already 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.540
 the texts finish us and good meters 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.420
 in melwood a performance of 10 always 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.690
 we have to congratulate him 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.470
 and well now it's my way that is 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.770
 my heel flares my heel plane 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.449
 16 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.099
 you know what I'm gonna do to me 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.840
 The charisma is worrying because it is already 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.300
 maximum of his physical attack and then 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.840
 all ways with the framework as it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.620
 it does even more 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.620
 more resistant 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:04.750
 but not my titles today but the truth 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.430
 is that we did not see those stones and I'm going to 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.530
 use so it's the disadvantage of heel 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.720
 plane and do not worry the online will not be 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.330
 you saw pretty well 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.780
 I'm still with the pus dragon 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.249
 now I explore him and now I turned him 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.409
 resist quite well 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.350
 and then it does not even control all of them already 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.810
 we are going 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.500
 Finally I said to see who I have left to me 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.640
 it is no longer I have the sacred to me 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.950
 Touch me touch kiss hehehe good hook me 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.500
 did you do with rose life pam pam verdad 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.420
 but that I'm maybe even that endures 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.710
 pretty good and train your defenses 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.140
 and I insist that the lake has to die if 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.330
 I had to enable it because I had 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.150
 worried the pebbles also 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.940
 they wanted to push me back all in 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.940
 kiss and now we see that new attack of 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.960
 explode so it's limited to 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.630
 follow him doing that attack for 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.390
 misfortune for the toqui is faster 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:16.200
 I have it easy with him 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.780
 English and what do you think is magical glitter 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.950
 in Spanish 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:25.400
 finally and well we won 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.050
 but well this would be all friends I hope
