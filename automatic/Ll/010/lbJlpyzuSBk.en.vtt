next we want to bring out some of her
facial<00:00:06.299> features<00:00:06.960> because<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> bottom<00:00:08.040> of

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
facial features because the bottom of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
facial features because the bottom of
the<00:00:08.340> image<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.030> much<00:00:09.269> darker<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:10.590> much

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the image is so much darker with so much

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.700 
the image is so much darker with so much
more<00:00:10.980> contrast<00:00:11.610> than<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.360> top<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.929> her<00:00:13.440> face

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
more contrast than the top in her face

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.580 
more contrast than the top in her face
we'll<00:00:14.549> take<00:00:14.820> care<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> overall<00:00:15.420> bits<00:00:16.260> here

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we'll take care of the overall bits here

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
we'll take care of the overall bits here
in<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> while<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.190> right<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.850> want<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
in a while but right now I just want to

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660 
in a while but right now I just want to
bring<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> her<00:00:19.619> facial<00:00:20.039> features<00:00:20.070> so

bring out some of her facial features so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200 
bring out some of her facial features so
let's<00:00:21.150> zoom<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.199> her<00:00:22.560> face<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:24.180> are

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
let's zoom in on her face and there are

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 
let's zoom in on her face and there are
a<00:00:24.300> couple<00:00:24.330> ways<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.740> either

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
a couple ways to do this you can either

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.769 
a couple ways to do this you can either
stick<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.789> method<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.750> both

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
stick with one method or you can do both

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.740 
stick with one method or you can do both
it's<00:00:28.260> just<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:28.710> quick<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.699> first<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it's just very quick the first is to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's just very quick the first is to
make<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> new<00:00:31.740> fill<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:31.980> adjustment<00:00:32.189> layer

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
make a new fill or adjustment layer

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.690 
make a new fill or adjustment layer
again<00:00:33.780> let's<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> curves<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.950> bring<00:00:35.550> our

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
again let's go to curves and bring our

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.619 
again let's go to curves and bring our
histogram<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.570> toward<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> lower<00:00:37.590> right

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
histogram down toward the lower right

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.590 
histogram down toward the lower right
invert<00:00:39.629> our<00:00:39.870> curves<00:00:40.559> mask<00:00:40.980> ctrl<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.090> command<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
invert our curves mask ctrl or command I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.100 
invert our curves mask ctrl or command I
have<00:00:43.410> our<00:00:43.649> brush<00:00:43.920> tool<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.030> adjust<00:00:45.570> using

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
have our brush tool and adjust using

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.700 
have our brush tool and adjust using
your<00:00:46.230> open<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.620> close<00:00:46.800> bracket<00:00:47.280> keys<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
your open and close bracket keys and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
your open and close bracket keys and
just<00:00:49.910> draw<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:52.100> what<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:55.230> her

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just draw on what you can see of her

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
just draw on what you can see of her
facial<00:00:55.829> features<00:00:56.430> her<00:00:56.670> nose<00:00:56.910> her<00:00:57.449> eyes<00:00:58.070> her

your<00:01:07.860> brush<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> might<00:01:12.450> need<00:01:13.010> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
your brush as you go you might need to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
your brush as you go you might need to
go<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.700> fact<00:01:14.880> almost<00:01:15.450> certainly<00:01:15.869> will

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
go over in fact almost certainly will

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
go over in fact almost certainly will
over<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> couple<00:01:17.340> times<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> good

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
over this a couple times it's a good

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 
over this a couple times it's a good
idea<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.470> bring<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.799> opacity<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.729> low<00:01:21.060> in

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
idea to bring your opacity down low in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
idea to bring your opacity down low in
your<00:01:21.840> layers<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.740> everything<00:01:22.890> just

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
your layers and not do everything just

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.359 
your layers and not do everything just
in<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:24.600> big<00:01:24.900> sweep<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.189> natural

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in one big sweep it's just more natural

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
in one big sweep it's just more natural
so<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.259> hugely<00:01:29.189> detailed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so you don't have to be hugely detailed

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
so you don't have to be hugely detailed
in<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.960> around

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
in this go around

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.520 
in this go around
let's<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.549> some<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.259> contrast<00:01:34.259> back

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
let's just get some of the contrast back

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.069 
let's just get some of the contrast back
when<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.490> done<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.840> filter<00:01:37.520> blur

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
when you're done go up to filter blur

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.910 
when you're done go up to filter blur
Gaussian<00:01:40.079> blur<00:01:40.220> keep<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.970> low<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:43.500> two

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
Gaussian blur keep it kind of low to two

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.639 
Gaussian blur keep it kind of low to two
and<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> half<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.689> blur<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> edges<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.560> bit

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and a half just to blur the edges a bit

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.550 
and a half just to blur the edges a bit
and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.579> take<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:48.000> opacity<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> said

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and then take your opacity like I said

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
and then take your opacity like I said
you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.829> pretty<00:01:50.100> far<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you want pretty far down you want it to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.520 
you want pretty far down you want it to
be<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> natural<00:01:52.409> thing<00:01:53.570> just<00:01:54.570> darken<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
be a natural thing just darken it a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.219 
be a natural thing just darken it a
little<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> 25%<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.960> then

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
little I have it down to 25% and then

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
little I have it down to 25% and then
you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> few<00:01:59.430> layers<00:01:59.729> one<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.210> top<00:02:00.329> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you can do a few layers one on top of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600 
you can do a few layers one on top of
the<00:02:00.689> other<00:02:00.930> now<00:02:01.649> we'll<00:02:01.829> go<00:02:01.979> over<00:02:02.100> our<00:02:02.219> next

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the other now we'll go over our next

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.149 
the other now we'll go over our next
method<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.930> darken<00:02:04.380> some<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> areas

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
method to darken some of the areas

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.190 
method to darken some of the areas
create<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> new<00:02:05.790> layer<00:02:06.030> change<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:07.049> layer
