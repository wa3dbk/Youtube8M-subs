00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello to all the boys and girls 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.969
 welcome once again here to one of 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 these advances is plasma without game and in 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.980
 this time what we see has been that 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 gameplay that has been presented over 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.180
 six minutes of good duration 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.880
 exactly six minutes in which by 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.760
 end we saw images in game of that 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.769
 metal gear solid 5 that by the way already 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.050
 we have said in previous videos that it is 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.360
 that the phantom pain that mysterious 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.520
 I have three guests here 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.440
 three friends who usually tend 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.320
 also participate in the voice podcast 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.899
 of the gamers and I want them to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.660
 count if you think this game 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.920
 could really playstation 3 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 or xbox 360 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.629
 in this way that we are seeing in 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.579
 this gameplay since we remember that this 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.910
 game as said will appear in 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.359
 xbox 360 and on playstation3 also 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.120
 would appear on pc since kojima would want 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.890
 do it cross-platform but they have not 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.290
 named the consoles of the nexgen 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.330
 still so for example mobile and you 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.300
 as best these images do you think that 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.860
 really playstation3 and xbox 360 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.520
 they could run it this way because I 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.700
 I do not know in some sections I can 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.040
 removing a bit at once what is it 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.460
 what we are seeing then is the route 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.250
 for a pc but play 3 and I is that what 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.470
 I doubt I doubt that at least a hundred 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 Per hundred of what we are seeing 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.820
 I think I could not run it though 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.479
 well you never know how good we have 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.180
 also to cats on the other side of the line 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.130
 and well, katsu for example, I think 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.410
 have a different opinion and the yes that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.010
 It is not true that the consoles of 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.900
 the current generation can move this 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.450
 with respect to the interactions to play 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.550
 3 and 360 I see more trained to play 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.170
 3 taking it off a little bit from below 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.450
 resolution to the best effects of anti 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.850
 arias because I see that it is applied in 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
 all scenarios 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.690
 we go effects of lights I see them possible 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.480
 the shadows yes it is true that no 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.819
 They have no type of sawtooth 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.400
 it's already pretty clear maybe 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.650
 I trust Colima a lot and surely 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.629
 some type engine like those that 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.959
 they developed those of naughty dog I think 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.719
 that something this man has in mind and 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.760
 developed to at least run to 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.969
 a play 3 what happens is that if 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.329
 then you will also go for the 360 ​​is what 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:38.150
 that leaves me like that a little I do not know I would not know 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:41.989
 tell you if really the 360 ​​I think not 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.209
 I could not move this anymore, I think I still 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.349
 thinking that the p3 is far superior 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.870
 what happens is that we carry a whole 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.909
 generation eating by is 360 and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.189
 really it has not seen power 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.419
 I believe that yes it is 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.000
 true that in terms of effects of 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.189
 lighting and other playstation3 in this 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.930
 occasion would have much more strength and what 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.549
 what are we seeing, I think so 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.590
 that could be produced in a 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.239
 playstation 3 but yes it is true that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.040
 let's see some elements of this 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.900
 gameplay specifically that's when 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.510
 you will have a little bit of doubt and as well 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.819
 you said that debugging that has to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.919
 have these images absolutely not 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.510
 you see neither a sawtooth any 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.420
 scratch hard you can not see anything 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.220
 that could make us think that this is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.890
 there may be a playstation 3 in addition 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.319
 this game let's not forget that metal gear 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.739
 solid 5 according to what has been said could 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.290
 to be a sandbox is to say a game of a 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.760
 quite open world and right now what 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.950
 that we are seeing that it is true that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.349
 it's a hallway but imagine when 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.390
 we had for that in a world 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.640
 open in a larger environment where 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.430
 I had to move more things and I give him the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.930
 step to barry burton while we see that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 character that is in the background that to me 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.209
 remember a lot as well as before the first 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.859
 metal gear solid 'and the truth is that there 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.720
 I think there are people who also 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.579
 remember pretty I do not know if you perry you 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.560
 remember and step by then give us your 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.150
 opinion on whether you think this is 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.740
 could run on the consoles of the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.660
 current generation 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.850
 talking if it 's I'm like before I did not 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.700
 I think it's more of a wink than something else and 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.170
 I have seen several winks to characters 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.790
 as for example voice that also comes out 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.260
 on a horse that I do not know if it's you 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.300
 exactly but it is given an air 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.400
 great to the metal voice character 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.950
 gear solid 3 on whether this can 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.320
 move a playstation 3 yo as it is 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.020
 see in this trailer is not that what I am 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.450
 quite blunt does not look basically for 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.430
 several details and if you watch the trailer 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.740
 not only since they do not have any teeth 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.470
 of sierra that the fire is spectacular 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.360
 that the shadows are perfect let's say 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.460
 that simply when snake goes 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.860
 crawling on the floor the creases 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.330
 of clothes react such and how 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.160
 they would react if you were crawling 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.190
 for the same clothes the creators of the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.360
 feet the toes and feet of 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.320
 video games are usually pretty 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.970
 planes and here have the foot was supported 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.260
 just as it would support you in real life 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.480
 the foot 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.640
 cs 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.050
 in the clothes of the Lord this that you 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.870
 accompanies with the face covered the clothes 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.910
 reacts as the soil as the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.260
 Look but as any element 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.970
 right now in the snake pants 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.770
 when it is dragging they are seeing 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.150
 the folds how does it move that does not 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.950
 I'm going to possible in a generation 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.690
 look, for example, pants 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.880
 the typical circle that does not just 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.310
 hook with the body does not engage 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.050
 all like bracelets that looks like 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.330
 that is floating I do not know if it 's good 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.570
 but it is that they are generation things 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.130
 current 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.830
 I do not know if the next generation will see 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.270
 Those are things that not very much that 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.700
 it has to be very very purified for 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.320
 that look perfect are mistakes like 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.000
 example in the demo of watts dogs had 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.890
 moments when the jacket went through 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.350
 the legs of the character and was nexgen 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.670
 is that those are things that are mistakes 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.410
 that I think he will have the games all 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.900
 life you see this more perfect 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.700
 then not much more polished than you and 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.350
 for here it is and a version of 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.950
 playstation 3 I do not deny it but let it be 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.840
 maybe more more let's say be reduced in 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.950
 all the elements in the smoke that by 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.870
 example like we're seeing now 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.870
 that's going to ask you right now 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.700
 that smoke you really think what it is 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.650
 that smoke is possible in the consoles of 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.180
 the current generation that system of 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.310
 particles is also true that the 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.170
 game uses a new graphic engine and 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.450
 maybe this gives us those 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.980
 possibilities in the characteristics of 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.120
 the current generation of consoles 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.820
 that either but I do not know good because there's no 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.380
 no problem guys we'll see what it is 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.810
 what happens we'll see if we discover 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.730
 more things the truth is that the images 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.680
 we have them here right now what 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.450
 we are seeing are images of that 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.780
 trailer by the way with a musical theme 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.340
 of the band garbage the truth is that a 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.250
 I was surprised enough to hear 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.860
 this is a pretty curious song that 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.110
 I suppose you are going to wear this game 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.020
 otherwise I would not put it on the trailer 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.910
 and well, we are going to be very attentive to 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.040
 more information about this metal 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.740
 gear solid 5 many thanks guys 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:03.340
 for having been there commenting and we 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:06.430
 we see people who think the public by 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.980
 supposed rivers of ink in the section of 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.320
 comments that the debate be organized and 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.009
 you will all say and write your 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.460
 commentary 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.409
 to respect please anyone and giving 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.770
 your opinion on you think that this 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:23.050
 metal gear solid 5 the phantom pain is 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.509
 possible really as it has been shown 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.379
 as it has been shown in the current 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:28.379
 generation of consoles
