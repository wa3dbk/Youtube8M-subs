00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.620 
pattern is used a lot and scarves and
blankets<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.660> it<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:19.160> used<00:00:19.430> as<00:00:19.850> a<00:00:20.270> boarder

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
blankets and it is used as a boarder

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.560 
blankets and it is used as a boarder
pattern<00:00:21.200> it<00:00:22.190> is<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.180> very<00:00:23.539> flat<00:00:23.930> pattern<00:00:25.570> except

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
pattern it is a very flat pattern except

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.480 
pattern it is a very flat pattern except
on<00:00:26.779> your<00:00:26.930> turn<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.590> side<00:00:27.800> you<00:00:28.100> will<00:00:28.160> see

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
on your turn to the side you will see

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.990 
on your turn to the side you will see
these<00:00:28.670> bumps<00:00:29.650> which<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.949> think<00:00:30.980> very<00:00:31.730> very

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
these bumps which is I think very very

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.750 
these bumps which is I think very very
very<00:00:32.390> very<00:00:32.570> pretty<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:34.399> turn<00:00:34.640> it

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
very very pretty and if you turn it

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.809 
very very pretty and if you turn it
around<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.629> is<00:00:35.809> exactly<00:00:36.409> the<00:00:36.649> same<00:00:36.890> same

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:37.819 
around it is exactly the same same

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:39.849 
around it is exactly the same same
pattern<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:38.420> there<00:00:38.569> is<00:00:38.690> no<00:00:38.899> front<00:00:39.319> or<00:00:39.589> back

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
pattern so there is no front or back

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.649 
pattern so there is no front or back
here<00:00:40.249> it's<00:00:40.489> actually<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.389> reversible<00:00:42.289> pattern

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
here it's actually a reversible pattern

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.379 
here it's actually a reversible pattern
so<00:00:44.659> the<00:00:44.780> pattern<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.409> composed<00:00:45.889> of<00:00:46.389> multiples

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:47.389 
so the pattern is composed of multiples

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:53.500 
so the pattern is composed of multiples
of<00:00:47.629> two<00:00:48.549> plus<00:00:49.549> one<00:00:51.579> so<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.699> pattern<00:00:53.149> is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
of two plus one so the pattern is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.009 
of two plus one so the pattern is
actually<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.469> knit<00:00:54.829> purl<00:00:55.219> knit<00:00:55.989> pattern<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
actually a knit purl knit pattern so you

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.479 
actually a knit purl knit pattern so you
knit<00:01:00.019> purl<00:01:00.409> knit<00:01:00.909> purl<00:01:01.909> knit<00:01:02.299> purl<00:01:02.539> knit<00:01:02.869> purl

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
knit purl knit purl knit purl knit purl

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.160 
knit purl knit purl knit purl knit purl
all<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.850> way<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.210> end<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.570> row<00:01:05.780> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
all the way to the end of the row and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.320 
all the way to the end of the row and
you<00:01:06.320> should<00:01:06.500> end<00:01:06.710> up<00:01:06.830> with<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.100> knit<00:01:07.700> on<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
you should end up with a knit on the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.650 
you should end up with a knit on the
very<00:01:08.540> last<00:01:08.840> stitch<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.160> I<00:01:10.220> kept<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.640> on<00:01:10.760> 9<00:01:11.120> here

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
very last stitch so I kept it on 9 here

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.500 
very last stitch so I kept it on 9 here
so<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:14.030> knit<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.590> will<00:01:15.740> be<00:01:15.950> knit<00:01:16.510> purl

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
so if I knit this it will be knit purl
