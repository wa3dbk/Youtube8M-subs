we're<00:00:01.709> now<00:00:01.890> at<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.750> incredible<00:00:03.750> place<00:00:04.049> where

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
we're now at this incredible place where

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.499 
we're now at this incredible place where
we're<00:00:04.529> gathering<00:00:05.069> information<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.940> data<00:00:06.089> so

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
we're gathering information and data so

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.080 
we're gathering information and data so
quickly<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.319> were<00:00:07.560> unraveling<00:00:08.340> what<00:00:09.059> I

quickly that were unraveling what I

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.759 
quickly that were unraveling what I
think<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> great<00:00:09.780> unknown<00:00:09.960> which<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
looks at it a different way and together

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660 
looks at it a different way and together
we<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.240> design<00:02:09.360> studies<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.950> definitively

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we can design studies that definitively

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
we can design studies that definitively
give<00:02:12.090> us<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.300> direction<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> path<00:02:13.260> forward

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
give us a direction or a path forward

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
give us a direction or a path forward
and<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.220> collaborative<00:02:14.790> science<00:02:15.240> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and that that collaborative science is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.110 
and that that collaborative science is
incredibly<00:02:15.570> powerful
