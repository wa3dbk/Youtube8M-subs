hi<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.339> mr.<00:00:05.609> Andersen<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this is the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.509 
hi it's mr. Andersen and this is the
third<00:00:07.049> podcast<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:07.950> life<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.340> Earth

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
third podcast in the life on Earth

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
third podcast in the life on Earth
series<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.389> one<00:00:09.540> I'm<00:00:09.660> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.960> talk

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
series and this one I'm going to talk

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.419 
series and this one I'm going to talk
about<00:00:10.260> things<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.650> aren't<00:00:10.830> really<00:00:11.010> alive

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
about things that aren't really alive

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.690 
about things that aren't really alive
and<00:00:11.730> those<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:12.030> viruses<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:13.170> 1982<00:00:14.160> Richards

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and those are viruses in 1982 Richards

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.400 
and those are viruses in 1982 Richards
grunta<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.330> he<00:00:15.420> was<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> 15<00:00:15.960> year<00:00:16.109> old<00:00:16.230> high

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
grunta when he was a 15 year old high

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.950 
grunta when he was a 15 year old high
school<00:00:16.440> student<00:00:17.119> was<00:00:18.119> sick<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> people<00:00:18.570> taking

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
school student was sick of people taking

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
school student was sick of people taking
his<00:00:19.170> disks<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.740> borrowing<00:00:20.130> his<00:00:20.400> disks<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
his disks and borrowing his disks and so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.090 
his disks and borrowing his disks and so
he<00:00:21.180> both<00:00:21.390> basically<00:00:22.020> wrote<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> program<00:00:22.590> called

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
he both basically wrote a program called

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
he both basically wrote a program called
the<00:00:23.279> elk<00:00:23.460> cloner<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.960> would<00:00:25.230> copy<00:00:25.529> itself

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the elk cloner that would copy itself

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
the elk cloner that would copy itself
onto<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> computer<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.730> then<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.660> would<00:00:27.779> copy

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
onto the computer and then it would copy

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
onto the computer and then it would copy
itself<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> disks<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.609> were<00:00:29.670> injected

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
itself on to disks that were injected

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330 
itself on to disks that were injected
into<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> computer<00:00:31.050> basically<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.189> would

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
into the computer basically it would

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
into the computer basically it would
boot<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.790> 50th<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:33.989> give<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
boot up the 50th time it would give you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
boot up the 50th time it would give you
this<00:00:34.350> warning<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.219> poem<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.420> was

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
this warning this little poem and it was

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
this warning this little poem and it was
really<00:00:36.780> highly<00:00:37.290> infectious<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:38.010> fact<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> was

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really highly infectious in fact it was

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.299 
really highly infectious in fact it was
the<00:00:38.579> first<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.390> infectious<00:00:40.309> computer

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the first really infectious computer

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
the first really infectious computer
virus<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.850> ever<00:00:42.030> written<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
virus that was ever written and so the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
virus that was ever written and so the
program<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.800> able<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> move<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.610> computer

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
program was able to move from computer

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
program was able to move from computer
to<00:00:45.270> computer<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.930> computer<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:47.309> no

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
to computer to computer if there's no

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
to computer to computer if there's no
computer<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.300> there's<00:00:48.510> no<00:00:48.660> computer<00:00:49.110> virus

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
computer then there's no computer virus

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.279 
computer then there's no computer virus
and<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.010> viruses<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> same<00:00:51.390> way<00:00:51.420> these

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and so viruses work the same way these

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.049 
and so viruses work the same way these
right<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:52.829> bacteria<00:00:53.579> phages<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
right here are bacteria phages and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
right here are bacteria phages and
basically<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.559> inject

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
basically what they do is they inject

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.970 
basically what they do is they inject
their<00:00:56.039> DNA<00:00:56.300> into<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> bacteria<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.649> use<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
their DNA into a bacteria they use the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
their DNA into a bacteria they use the
machinery<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> bacteria<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:01.230> copies

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
machinery of the bacteria to make copies

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
machinery of the bacteria to make copies
of<00:01:01.859> themselves<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.940> other<00:01:03.180> words<00:01:03.449> they're

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
of themselves in other words they're

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
of themselves in other words they're
going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.260> copies<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> DNA<00:01:05.369> they're

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
going to make copies of the DNA they're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.219 
going to make copies of the DNA they're
then<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> DNA<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> make

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
then going to take the DNA to make

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.399 
then going to take the DNA to make
messenger<00:01:07.770> RNA<00:01:08.159> RNA<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.689> make<00:01:09.900> proteins

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
messenger RNA RNA and then make proteins

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
messenger RNA RNA and then make proteins
and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:10.860> those<00:01:11.040> proteins<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and then those proteins are going to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
and then those proteins are going to
enclose<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.170> DNA<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:13.950> they're<00:01:14.100> going

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
enclose the DNA and then they're going

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
enclose the DNA and then they're going
to<00:01:14.600> disperse<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> they're<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.140> move<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to disperse and they're going to move to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950 
to disperse and they're going to move to
another<00:01:16.590> bacteria<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.060> viruses<00:01:18.689> spread

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
another bacteria and so viruses spread

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.190 
another bacteria and so viruses spread
using<00:01:19.619> cells<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.729> there's<00:01:21.060> no<00:01:21.270> cell<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:22.140> like

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
using cells if there's no cell just like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 
using cells if there's no cell just like
if<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.619> no<00:01:22.770> computer<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:23.700> no

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
if there's no computer then there's no

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
if there's no computer then there's no
virus<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:24.659> why<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.110> classify

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
virus and that's why we don't classify

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
virus and that's why we don't classify
them<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.040> alive<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.270> definitely<00:01:27.540> have

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
them as alive they definitely have

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
them as alive they definitely have
elements<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.229> living<00:01:28.680> things<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.640> don't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
elements of living things but they don't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.130 
elements of living things but they don't
have<00:01:29.939> metabolism<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.020> have

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have metabolism they don't have

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
have metabolism they don't have
reproduction<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> their<00:01:32.130> own<00:01:32.340> without<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.570> cell

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
reproduction on their own without a cell

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.010 
reproduction on their own without a cell
to<00:01:34.200> inject<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.490> basically<00:01:36.020> it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to inject it in and so basically it's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
to inject it in and so basically it's
important<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> study<00:01:37.770> viruses<00:01:38.070> because

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
important to study viruses because

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.160 
important to study viruses because
they're<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> main<00:01:39.600> sites<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
they're one of the main sites of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
they're one of the main sites of
diseases<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.820> other<00:01:42.299> words

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
diseases that we have in other words

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
diseases that we have in other words
millions<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> people<00:01:43.560> were<00:01:43.740> killed<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
millions of people were killed by the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
millions of people were killed by the
influenza<00:01:45.210> outbreak<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> heels<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.619> World

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
influenza outbreak on the heels of World

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.719 
influenza outbreak on the heels of World
War<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.350> 1918<00:01:49.350> influenza<00:01:49.860> viruses<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
War one the 1918 influenza viruses is a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
War one the 1918 influenza viruses is a
reproduction<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.780> virus<00:01:51.960> looked

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
reproduction of what that virus looked

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100 
reproduction of what that virus looked
like<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.829> herpes<00:01:53.070> virus<00:01:53.759> or<00:01:54.000> poliovirus<00:01:54.540> or

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
like or herpes virus or poliovirus or

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690 
like or herpes virus or poliovirus or
look<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.409> all<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.649> viruses<00:01:56.130> over<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.549> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
look at all these viruses over here that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
look at all these viruses over here that
infect<00:01:57.119> us<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> weren't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
infect us and so basically if it weren't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.609 
infect us and so basically if it weren't
for<00:01:59.340> our<00:01:59.520> cells<00:01:59.820> they<00:02:00.149> couldn't<00:02:00.450> copy<00:02:00.630> makes

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
for our cells they couldn't copy makes

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
for our cells they couldn't copy makes
make<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.369> couldn't<00:02:02.670> make<00:02:02.759> copies<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
make they couldn't make copies of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.810 
make they couldn't make copies of
themselves<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.680> where<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.040> viruses<00:02:05.579> come

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
themselves and so where did viruses come

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.399 
themselves and so where did viruses come
from<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.270> we'll<00:02:06.479> probably<00:02:06.630> you'll<00:02:07.079> never

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
from well we'll probably you'll never

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
from well we'll probably you'll never
know<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:08.069> answer<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.910> here's<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
know the right answer this but here's a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.859 
know the right answer this but here's a
few<00:02:09.420> theories

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
few theories

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
few theories
there's<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.619> cellular<00:02:11.129> theory<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.640> they

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
there's the cellular theory that they

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670 
there's the cellular theory that they
used<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.090> part<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.510> cells<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.260> apply

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
used to be part of cells and so apply

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.170 
used to be part of cells and so apply
Esmond<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.129> example<00:02:14.579> is<00:02:14.700> given<00:02:14.849> off<00:02:15.150> by

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
Esmond for example is given off by

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.759 
Esmond for example is given off by
bacteria<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.109> be<00:02:16.230> picked<00:02:16.469> up<00:02:16.560> by<00:02:16.739> other

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
bacteria can be picked up by other

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.099 
bacteria can be picked up by other
bacteria<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.180> maybe<00:02:18.359> they<00:02:18.569> started<00:02:18.900> that

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
bacteria and so maybe they started that

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.899 
bacteria and so maybe they started that
way<00:02:19.319> or<00:02:19.560> maybe<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.980> were<00:02:20.040> full-on<00:02:20.489> cells

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
way or maybe they were full-on cells

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.830 
way or maybe they were full-on cells
that<00:02:21.599> regress<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.500> chlamydia<00:02:23.099> for<00:02:23.430> example<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that regress so chlamydia for example is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.740 
that regress so chlamydia for example is
a<00:02:24.900> type<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.819> cell<00:02:26.819> that's<00:02:27.180> lost<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.659> ability

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
a type of cell that's lost the ability

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.770 
a type of cell that's lost the ability
to<00:02:28.260> live<00:02:28.859> on<00:02:29.189> its<00:02:29.400> own<00:02:29.609> and<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.659> an

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
to live on its own and so now it's an

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.319 
to live on its own and so now it's an
obligate<00:02:31.590> parasite<00:02:32.159> or<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:33.000> could<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.239> been

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
obligate parasite or it could have been

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.119 
obligate parasite or it could have been
coevolution<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.290> these<00:02:34.469> viruses<00:02:34.980> were

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
coevolution that these viruses were

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.369 
coevolution that these viruses were
evolving<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:36.000> cells<00:02:36.359> just<00:02:36.719> like<00:02:36.840> insects

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
evolving with cells just like insects

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.929 
evolving with cells just like insects
and<00:02:37.500> plants<00:02:37.920> were<00:02:38.010> evolving<00:02:38.430> together<00:02:38.549> this

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
and plants were evolving together this

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.300 
and plants were evolving together this
is<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.420> V<00:02:39.629> roid<00:02:39.870> which<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.889> a<00:02:40.920> little<00:02:41.189> bit

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
is a little V roid which is a little bit

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.550 
is a little V roid which is a little bit
of<00:02:41.400> RNAi<00:02:41.790> plant<00:02:42.209> virus<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.049> there's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
of RNAi plant virus and so there's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920 
of RNAi plant virus and so there's
there's<00:02:43.980> evidence<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.609> suggest<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.329> any<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
there's evidence to suggest that any of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.379 
there's evidence to suggest that any of
these<00:02:46.079> theories<00:02:46.409> could<00:02:46.769> have<00:02:47.150> produced<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
these theories could have produced that

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.210 
these theories could have produced that
first<00:02:48.810> virus<00:02:49.349> but<00:02:49.530> nonetheless<00:02:49.739> we

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
first virus but nonetheless we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.429 
first virus but nonetheless we
eventually<00:02:50.489> had<00:02:50.849> viruses<00:02:51.419> so<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.319> are<00:02:52.409> some

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
eventually had viruses so what are some

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.229 
eventually had viruses so what are some
characteristics<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.639> structure<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
characteristics in the structure of a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.179 
characteristics in the structure of a
virus<00:02:54.599> well<00:02:54.810> all<00:02:54.989> viruses<00:02:55.439> are<00:02:55.829> going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.010> have

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
virus well all viruses are going to have

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.099 
virus well all viruses are going to have
nucleic<00:02:56.609> acids<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.299> they<00:02:57.389> have<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.750> some

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
nucleic acids so they have to have some

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.709 
nucleic acids so they have to have some
kind<00:02:58.139> of<00:02:58.500> genetic<00:02:58.919> material<00:02:59.510> sometimes<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
kind of genetic material sometimes that

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.240 
kind of genetic material sometimes that
is<00:03:00.900> DNA<00:03:01.439> and<00:03:01.709> sometimes<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.090> already

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
is DNA and sometimes that is already

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.890 
is DNA and sometimes that is already
sometimes<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.489> DNA<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.299> double-stranded

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
sometimes that DNA is double-stranded

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500 
sometimes that DNA is double-stranded
and<00:03:07.590> sometimes<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:08.519> single-stranded<00:03:09.299> and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and sometimes it's single-stranded and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.599 
and sometimes it's single-stranded and
sometimes<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.500> RNA<00:03:10.919> is<00:03:11.099> normal

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
sometimes that RNA is normal

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.190 
sometimes that RNA is normal
single-stranded<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.599> sometimes<00:03:12.989> it's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
single-stranded and sometimes it's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
single-stranded and sometimes it's
double-stranded<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.129> so<00:03:14.519> these<00:03:14.639> are<00:03:14.790> all

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
double-stranded and so these are all

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.059 
double-stranded and so these are all
different<00:03:15.480> types<00:03:15.689> of<00:03:16.049> genetic<00:03:16.439> material<00:03:16.620> that

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
different types of genetic material that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.009 
different types of genetic material that
could<00:03:17.189> be<00:03:17.250> found<00:03:17.519> inside<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:18.060> virus<00:03:18.569> but

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
could be found inside a virus but

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.899 
could be found inside a virus but
they're<00:03:19.169> all<00:03:19.319> genetic<00:03:20.099> materials<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:20.729> that's

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
they're all genetic materials so that's

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.059 
they're all genetic materials so that's
thing<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.269> all<00:03:21.419> viruses<00:03:22.260> have<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.919> other

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
thing that all viruses have the other

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.099 
thing that all viruses have the other
thing<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.400> all<00:03:23.519> viruses<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.209> is<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.479> protein

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
thing that all viruses have is a protein

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.719 
thing that all viruses have is a protein
coat<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.829> other<00:03:25.949> words<00:03:26.159> they<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> coat

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
coat in other words they have the coat

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.670 
coat in other words they have the coat
that<00:03:26.780> surrounds<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.810> virus<00:03:28.319> one<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
that surrounds that virus one of the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.319 
that surrounds that virus one of the
first<00:03:29.010> viruses<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.849> understood<00:03:30.269> and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
first viruses really understood and

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.569 
first viruses really understood and
crystallized<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.139> seen<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.430> tobacco

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
crystallized and seen is the tobacco

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.550 
crystallized and seen is the tobacco
mosaic<00:03:33.030> virus<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:33.959> can<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:34.229> here's<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
mosaic virus and you can see here's the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.949 
mosaic virus and you can see here's the
two<00:03:34.799> parts<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.459> got<00:03:35.549> RNA<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.389> a<00:03:36.540> coiled

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
two parts of it it's got RNA in a coiled

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.360 
two parts of it it's got RNA in a coiled
pattern<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.129> going<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.280> have

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
pattern and then it's going to have

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.129 
pattern and then it's going to have
these<00:03:38.579> protein<00:03:39.060> subunits<00:03:39.659> that<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:39.900> around

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
these protein subunits that go around

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.309 
these protein subunits that go around
the<00:03:40.319> outside<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:40.769> they<00:03:41.189> protect<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:41.970> DNA<00:03:42.629> now

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the outside so they protect that DNA now

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.439 
the outside so they protect that DNA now
a<00:03:43.349> lot<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.040> time<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.489> whole<00:03:44.729> protein<00:03:45.299> is

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
a lot of the time that whole protein is

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.679 
a lot of the time that whole protein is
simply<00:03:45.810> two<00:03:46.109> different<00:03:46.939> types<00:03:47.939> of<00:03:48.180> protein<00:03:48.569> we

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:48.689 
simply two different types of protein we

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.719 
simply two different types of protein we
call<00:03:48.840> those<00:03:48.959> protein<00:03:49.379> subunits<00:03:49.979> and<00:03:50.129> you<00:03:50.579> can

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
call those protein subunits and you can

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.249 
call those protein subunits and you can
see<00:03:50.939> here<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.269> just<00:03:51.659> having<00:03:51.930> those<00:03:52.079> two

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259 
see here that just having those two

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.679 
see here that just having those two
proteins<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.919> can<00:03:53.069> self-assemble<00:03:53.549> into<00:03:54.000> this

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
proteins it can self-assemble into this

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.080 
proteins it can self-assemble into this
shape<00:03:55.139> or<00:03:55.439> this<00:03:55.590> characteristic<00:03:56.069> viral<00:03:56.699> shape

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
shape or this characteristic viral shape

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.969 
shape or this characteristic viral shape
and<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:57.989> viruses<00:03:58.560> are<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.829> have

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
and so all viruses are going to have

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.069 
and so all viruses are going to have
these<00:03:59.129> two<00:03:59.400> things<00:03:59.639> but<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> lot<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.780> viruses

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
these two things but a lot of viruses

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.719 
these two things but a lot of viruses
are<00:04:01.349> also<00:04:01.500> going<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.799> have<00:04:01.949> an<00:04:02.069> envelope<00:04:02.280> so

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
are also going to have an envelope so

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.159 
are also going to have an envelope so
they're<00:04:02.879> going<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.209> lipid<00:04:03.599> bilayer

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
they're going to have a lipid bilayer

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.960 
they're going to have a lipid bilayer
and<00:04:04.439> so<00:04:04.919> this<00:04:05.069> right<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.400> would<00:04:05.489> be<00:04:05.549> human

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and so this right here would be human

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
and so this right here would be human
immunodeficiency<00:04:06.299> virus<00:04:06.930> or<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.500> virus<00:04:07.859> that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
immunodeficiency virus or the virus that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
immunodeficiency virus or the virus that
causes<00:04:08.250> AIDS<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.389> can<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.720> here<00:04:09.959> that

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
causes AIDS and you can see here that

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.039 
causes AIDS and you can see here that
we've<00:04:10.229> got<00:04:10.259> RNA<00:04:11.069> on<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.370> inside<00:04:11.819> we've<00:04:12.599> got<00:04:12.629> a

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
we've got RNA on the inside we've got a

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.839 
we've got RNA on the inside we've got a
capsid<00:04:13.620> or<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> protein<00:04:14.250> coat<00:04:14.459> around<00:04:14.759> the

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
capsid or a protein coat around the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.909 
capsid or a protein coat around the
outside<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:15.689> now<00:04:15.870> we've<00:04:16.109> got<00:04:16.289> this<00:04:16.500> lipid

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
outside but now we've got this lipid

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.560 
outside but now we've got this lipid
bilayer<00:04:17.519> around<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.940> outside<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.419> this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
bilayer around the outside or this

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.110 
bilayer around the outside or this
envelope<00:04:19.259> now<00:04:19.829> why<00:04:20.009> is<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.190> important<00:04:20.940> if<00:04:21.000> we

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
envelope now why is that important if we

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.940 
envelope now why is that important if we
say<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.509> is<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.659> typical<00:04:22.169> cell<00:04:22.529> let's<00:04:22.860> say

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
say this is a typical cell let's say

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.560 
say this is a typical cell let's say
this<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.219> a<00:04:23.250> typical<00:04:23.700> cell<00:04:23.909> in<00:04:24.120> your<00:04:24.210> upper

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
this is a typical cell in your upper

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.779 
this is a typical cell in your upper
respiratory<00:04:24.840> tract<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.159> let's<00:04:26.490> say<00:04:26.580> you're

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
respiratory tract and let's say you're

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.420 
respiratory tract and let's say you're
being<00:04:26.940> infected<00:04:27.599> by<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:28.229> rhino<00:04:28.710> virus<00:04:29.190> or<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
being infected by a rhino virus or a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640 
being infected by a rhino virus or a
virus<00:04:29.789> that<00:04:29.820> causes<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.330> common<00:04:30.659> cold<00:04:30.930> well

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
virus that causes a common cold well

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.409 
virus that causes a common cold well
around<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.250> outside<00:04:32.639> of<00:04:32.669> your<00:04:32.909> cell<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.270> going

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
around the outside of your cell is going

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.969 
around the outside of your cell is going
to<00:04:33.479> be<00:04:33.570> an<00:04:33.659> envelope<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.349> so<00:04:34.590> if<00:04:34.740> we<00:04:34.889> have

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
to be an envelope and so if we have

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.820 
to be an envelope and so if we have
another<00:04:35.370> virus<00:04:35.940> with<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.260> genetic<00:04:37.260> material<00:04:37.710> in

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
another virus with a genetic material in

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.469 
another virus with a genetic material in
a<00:04:37.919> capsid<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.550> let's<00:04:38.729> say<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.090> they<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.360> an

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
a capsid but let's say that they have an

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.629 
a capsid but let's say that they have an
envelope<00:04:39.690> around<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.469> outside<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:41.520> it

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
envelope around the outside when it

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.820 
envelope around the outside when it
attaches<00:04:42.029> to<00:04:42.330> your<00:04:42.690> cell<00:04:43.050> those<00:04:43.620> two

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
attaches to your cell those two

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.589 
attaches to your cell those two
envelopes<00:04:44.039> if<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.729> looks<00:04:44.940> exactly<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.479> same

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
envelopes if it looks exactly the same

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.019 
envelopes if it looks exactly the same
is<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.229> to<00:04:46.380> fuse<00:04:46.919> with<00:04:46.949> that<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.760> it<00:04:47.880> makes

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:48.029 
is going to fuse with that and it makes

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.209 
is going to fuse with that and it makes
it<00:04:48.180> easy<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:48.810> that<00:04:49.080> virus<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.620> gain<00:04:49.800> entry

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
it easy for that virus to gain entry

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.700 
it easy for that virus to gain entry
likewise<00:04:51.029> when<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.419> Lices<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.289> seller<00:04:52.500> when

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
likewise when it Lices the seller when

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.250 
likewise when it Lices the seller when
it<00:04:52.860> explodes<00:04:53.400> if<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:54.120> takes<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.449> little<00:04:54.870> bit<00:04:55.080> of

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
it explodes if it takes a little bit of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.860 
it explodes if it takes a little bit of
that<00:04:55.440> envelope<00:04:56.340> with<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.820> it's<00:04:57.210> much<00:04:57.570> less

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
that envelope with it it's much less

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.870 
that envelope with it it's much less
it's<00:04:58.169> much<00:04:58.529> more<00:04:58.860> likely<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.310> be<00:04:59.520> able<00:04:59.610> to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
it's much more likely to be able to

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.060 
it's much more likely to be able to
infect<00:05:00.150> another<00:05:00.539> cell<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.529> a<00:05:01.560> lot<00:05:01.860> of

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
infect another cell and so a lot of

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.700 
infect another cell and so a lot of
these<00:05:02.159> envelopes<00:05:02.430> are<00:05:03.139> gathered<00:05:04.139> from<00:05:04.500> the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
these envelopes are gathered from the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.529 
these envelopes are gathered from the
cell<00:05:04.919> in<00:05:05.130> which<00:05:05.159> they<00:05:05.520> infected<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.330> which

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
cell in which they infected in which

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.360 
cell in which they infected in which
they<00:05:06.719> are<00:05:06.870> leaving<00:05:07.349> so<00:05:07.919> how<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.130> they

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
they are leaving so how do they

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.890 
they are leaving so how do they
reproduce<00:05:08.699> how<00:05:09.090> does<00:05:09.240> this<00:05:09.389> actually<00:05:09.599> work

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
reproduce how does this actually work

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.240 
reproduce how does this actually work
well<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.940> viral<00:05:12.419> life<00:05:12.779> cycle<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.589> two<00:05:13.949> parts

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
well the viral life cycle is two parts

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.000 
well the viral life cycle is two parts
there's<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.699> lytic<00:05:15.150> cycle<00:05:15.560> lytic<00:05:16.560> comes<00:05:16.830> from

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
there's the lytic cycle lytic comes from

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.100 
there's the lytic cycle lytic comes from
the<00:05:17.099> word<00:05:17.250> lice<00:05:17.580> or<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:18.029> break<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.659> so<00:05:18.870> let's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
the word lice or to break and so let's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.750 
the word lice or to break and so let's
kind<00:05:19.199> of<00:05:19.469> look<00:05:19.529> right<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.219> bacteria

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
kind of look right here to bacteria

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.240 
kind of look right here to bacteria
phage<00:05:21.029> bacteria<00:05:21.990> phage<00:05:22.169> remember<00:05:22.650> infect

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
phage bacteria phage remember infect

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.490 
phage bacteria phage remember infect
bacteria<00:05:23.849> and<00:05:24.539> so<00:05:24.930> what<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.169> one<00:05:25.320> is<00:05:25.380> doing

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
bacteria and so what this one is doing

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.709 
bacteria and so what this one is doing
is<00:05:25.830> injecting<00:05:26.490> its<00:05:26.669> genetic<00:05:27.150> material<00:05:27.180> in

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
is injecting its genetic material in

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.230 
is injecting its genetic material in
this<00:05:27.839> case<00:05:28.050> DNA<00:05:28.680> into<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.219> bacteria<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.210> it

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
this case DNA into a bacteria so it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.740 
this case DNA into a bacteria so it
injected<00:05:30.930> its<00:05:31.050> DNA<00:05:31.500> into<00:05:32.039> a<00:05:32.070> bacteria<00:05:32.699> as<00:05:32.909> that

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
injected its DNA into a bacteria as that

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.810 
injected its DNA into a bacteria as that
cell<00:05:34.110> makes<00:05:34.409> copies<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.889> itself<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.430> can<00:05:35.669> see

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
cell makes copies of itself you can see

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.839 
cell makes copies of itself you can see
it's<00:05:35.969> making<00:05:36.300> copies<00:05:36.510> of<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:37.199> DNA<00:05:37.729> next<00:05:38.729> thing

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
it's making copies of the DNA next thing

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.579 
it's making copies of the DNA next thing
it's<00:05:39.000> doing<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.539> how<00:05:39.690> did<00:05:39.839> it<00:05:39.870> do<00:05:40.110> that<00:05:40.139> it's

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
it's doing so how did it do that it's

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.629 
it's doing so how did it do that it's
using<00:05:41.039> DNA<00:05:42.500> polymerase<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:44.010> it's<00:05:44.159> using<00:05:44.460> the

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
using DNA polymerase so it's using the

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.959 
using DNA polymerase so it's using the
machinery<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.449> cell<00:05:45.779> to<00:05:46.050> make<00:05:46.139> a<00:05:46.199> copy

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
machinery of the cell to make a copy

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.839 
machinery of the cell to make a copy
raised<00:05:47.969> to<00:05:48.960> make<00:05:49.080> a<00:05:49.110> copy<00:05:49.409> of<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.740> DNA<00:05:50.219> what's

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
raised to make a copy of the DNA what's

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.579 
raised to make a copy of the DNA what's
going<00:05:51.089> next<00:05:51.330> well<00:05:51.750> right<00:05:51.990> here<00:05:52.199> you<00:05:52.320> can<00:05:52.440> see

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
going next well right here you can see

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.129 
going next well right here you can see
it's<00:05:52.710> using<00:05:53.039> that<00:05:53.159> DNA<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.610> make<00:05:54.150> proteins<00:05:54.839> and

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
it's using that DNA to make proteins and

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.050 
it's using that DNA to make proteins and
so<00:05:55.289> how<00:05:55.409> does<00:05:55.469> it<00:05:55.680> do<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:55.949> well<00:05:56.250> in<00:05:56.729> this<00:05:56.849> case

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
so how does it do that well in this case

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.839 
so how does it do that well in this case
it's<00:05:57.300> using<00:05:57.630> RNA<00:05:58.199> polymerase<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:59.039> it's<00:05:59.610> also

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
it's using RNA polymerase and it's also

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.180 
it's using RNA polymerase and it's also
using<00:06:00.330> ribosomes<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.529> so<00:06:01.620> it's<00:06:01.770> using<00:06:02.010> the

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
using ribosomes and so it's using the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.550 
using ribosomes and so it's using the
ribosomes<00:06:02.760> inside<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.360> cell<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.930> make

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
ribosomes inside the cell to make

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.920 
ribosomes inside the cell to make
proteins<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:06.060> this<00:06:06.300> right<00:06:06.510> here<00:06:06.570> would<00:06:06.870> be

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
proteins and so this right here would be

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.409 
proteins and so this right here would be
transcription<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.889> translation<00:06:08.419> eventually

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
transcription and translation eventually

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.540 
transcription and translation eventually
we<00:06:09.599> have<00:06:09.839> our<00:06:10.110> genetic<00:06:10.589> material<00:06:10.740> we<00:06:11.339> have<00:06:11.430> the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
we have our genetic material we have the

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.550 
we have our genetic material we have the
proteins<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.270> now<00:06:12.810> we're<00:06:12.960> going<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.110> lyse<00:06:13.529> the

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
proteins and now we're going to lyse the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.439 
proteins and now we're going to lyse the
cell<00:06:14.130> and<00:06:14.370> so<00:06:14.490> what's<00:06:14.669> happening<00:06:15.120> is<00:06:15.270> these

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
cell and so what's happening is these

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.750 
cell and so what's happening is these
viruses<00:06:16.080> are<00:06:16.139> actually<00:06:16.440> erupting<00:06:17.279> from<00:06:17.610> the

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
viruses are actually erupting from the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.610 
viruses are actually erupting from the
cell<00:06:17.969> where<00:06:18.659> are<00:06:18.810> they<00:06:18.930> headed<00:06:19.320> they're

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
cell where are they headed they're

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.920 
cell where are they headed they're
headed<00:06:19.949> to<00:06:20.130> another<00:06:20.400> cell<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.449> inject<00:06:21.779> their

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
headed to another cell to inject their

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.649 
headed to another cell to inject their
DNA<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.740> make<00:06:23.070> copies<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.460> itself<00:06:23.880> and<00:06:24.180> so

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
DNA and make copies of itself and so

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:25.579 
DNA and make copies of itself and so
that's<00:06:24.839> how<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.020> can<00:06:25.199> just<00:06:25.380> get<00:06:25.469> a<00:06:25.500> few

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:25.589 
that's how you can just get a few

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.529 
that's how you can just get a few
viruses<00:06:26.039> and<00:06:26.550> you<00:06:26.610> can<00:06:26.789> get<00:06:26.909> a<00:06:26.940> huge<00:06:27.240> viral

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
viruses and you can get a huge viral

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.899 
viruses and you can get a huge viral
outbreak<00:06:28.199> we're<00:06:28.409> pretty<00:06:28.650> soon<00:06:28.949> exponentially

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
outbreak we're pretty soon exponentially

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.460 
outbreak we're pretty soon exponentially
we're<00:06:30.360> going<00:06:30.479> to<00:06:30.539> have<00:06:30.659> billions<00:06:31.289> and

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
we're going to have billions and

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.920 
we're going to have billions and
billions<00:06:31.620> of<00:06:31.889> viruses<00:06:32.039> being<00:06:32.699> created<00:06:33.270> and<00:06:33.419> so

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
billions of viruses being created and so

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.719 
billions of viruses being created and so
that's<00:06:34.139> one<00:06:34.470> part<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.919> life<00:06:35.069> cycle<00:06:35.099> if<00:06:35.639> you

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
that's one part of the life cycle if you

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.920 
that's one part of the life cycle if you
look<00:06:35.970> at<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.120> second<00:06:36.479> part<00:06:36.599> of<00:06:36.689> the<00:06:36.780> life

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
look at the second part of the life

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.480 
look at the second part of the life
cycle<00:06:36.960> that's<00:06:37.409> called<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.680> lysogenic<00:06:38.099> cycle

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
cycle that's called the lysogenic cycle

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.820 
cycle that's called the lysogenic cycle
in<00:06:39.000> other<00:06:39.180> words<00:06:39.389> it<00:06:39.539> can<00:06:39.720> generate<00:06:40.289> the<00:06:40.530> lytic

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
in other words it can generate the lytic

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.100 
in other words it can generate the lytic
cycle<00:06:40.860> what<00:06:41.819> happens<00:06:42.120> here<00:06:42.479> well<00:06:42.659> basically

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
cycle what happens here well basically

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.439 
cycle what happens here well basically
they<00:06:43.259> inject<00:06:43.620> their<00:06:43.740> DNA<00:06:43.800> in<00:06:44.400> it<00:06:44.669> becomes<00:06:45.060> part

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
they inject their DNA in it becomes part

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.240 
they inject their DNA in it becomes part
of<00:06:45.539> the<00:06:45.659> genetic<00:06:46.050> material<00:06:46.500> of<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.650> cell<00:06:46.740> and

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
of the genetic material of the cell and

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.249 
of the genetic material of the cell and
then<00:06:47.610> every<00:06:47.970> time<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.300> cell<00:06:48.479> makes<00:06:48.750> a<00:06:48.840> copy<00:06:49.110> of

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
then every time the cell makes a copy of

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.439 
then every time the cell makes a copy of
itself<00:06:49.439> it's<00:06:49.979> making<00:06:50.400> a<00:06:50.460> copy<00:06:50.759> of<00:06:51.060> that<00:06:51.090> virus

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
itself it's making a copy of that virus

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.719 
itself it's making a copy of that virus
and<00:06:51.930> so<00:06:52.439> that's<00:06:52.620> kind<00:06:52.919> of<00:06:52.979> insidious<00:06:53.400> it's

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
and so that's kind of insidious it's

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.189 
and so that's kind of insidious it's
almost<00:06:53.939> like<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.150> stealth<00:06:54.539> mode<00:06:54.810> where<00:06:55.080> they're

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
almost like a stealth mode where they're

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.409 
almost like a stealth mode where they're
injecting<00:06:55.710> their<00:06:55.830> DNA<00:06:56.220> it's<00:06:56.759> not<00:06:57.000> actually

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
injecting their DNA it's not actually

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.540 
injecting their DNA it's not actually
making<00:06:57.629> viruses<00:06:58.349> but<00:06:58.800> it's<00:06:58.979> using<00:06:59.430> the

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
making viruses but it's using the

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.040 
making viruses but it's using the
machinery<00:06:59.970> of<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.120> cell<00:07:00.330> to<00:07:00.509> copy<00:07:00.720> it<00:07:00.900> over

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
machinery of the cell to copy it over

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.170 
machinery of the cell to copy it over
and<00:07:01.379> over<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:01.800> over<00:07:02.069> again<00:07:02.189> so<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.000> quick

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
and over and over again so a quick

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.240 
and over and over again so a quick
example<00:07:03.210> in<00:07:03.750> humans<00:07:04.139> because<00:07:04.439> this<00:07:04.710> is<00:07:04.860> in

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
example in humans because this is in

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.980 
example in humans because this is in
bacteria<00:07:05.939> so<00:07:06.449> if<00:07:06.539> you've<00:07:06.659> ever<00:07:06.840> had

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
bacteria so if you've ever had

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.170 
bacteria so if you've ever had
chickenpox<00:07:07.379> that's<00:07:07.830> a<00:07:07.949> virus<00:07:08.490> it's<00:07:08.729> infect

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
chickenpox that's a virus it's infect

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.679 
chickenpox that's a virus it's infect
it's<00:07:09.449> infecting<00:07:10.169> its<00:07:10.789> DNA<00:07:11.789> into<00:07:11.819> the<00:07:12.120> cells<00:07:12.419> of

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:12.689 
it's infecting its DNA into the cells of

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.050 
it's infecting its DNA into the cells of
your<00:07:12.720> body<00:07:13.020> it's<00:07:13.259> forming<00:07:13.860> these<00:07:14.039> pox<00:07:14.639> which

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
your body it's forming these pox which

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.909 
your body it's forming these pox which
is<00:07:15.210> releasing<00:07:15.659> more<00:07:16.139> of<00:07:16.199> the<00:07:16.379> virus<00:07:16.500> to<00:07:16.830> infect

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
is releasing more of the virus to infect

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.309 
is releasing more of the virus to infect
more<00:07:17.370> of<00:07:17.580> the<00:07:17.699> cells<00:07:17.939> and<00:07:18.180> so<00:07:18.870> it's<00:07:19.110> going

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
more of the cells and so it's going

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.730 
more of the cells and so it's going
through<00:07:19.650> this<00:07:19.889> lytic<00:07:20.550> cycle<00:07:21.469> eventually<00:07:22.469> your

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
through this lytic cycle eventually your

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.010 
through this lytic cycle eventually your
immune<00:07:23.009> system<00:07:23.340> is<00:07:23.430> going<00:07:23.550> to<00:07:23.610> shut<00:07:23.849> it<00:07:23.969> down

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
immune system is going to shut it down

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.550 
immune system is going to shut it down
but<00:07:25.020> this<00:07:25.680> cell<00:07:26.610> has<00:07:27.030> injected<00:07:27.930> its<00:07:28.050> DNA<00:07:28.439> and

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 
but this cell has injected its DNA and

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.200 
but this cell has injected its DNA and
they'll<00:07:28.650> actually<00:07:28.770> sit<00:07:29.340> in<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.550> DNA<00:07:29.909> inside

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
they'll actually sit in the DNA inside

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.330 
they'll actually sit in the DNA inside
you<00:07:30.449> and<00:07:30.689> so<00:07:31.199> it<00:07:31.319> can<00:07:31.469> stay<00:07:31.770> there<00:07:32.039> it<00:07:32.219> can

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
you and so it can stay there it can

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.879 
you and so it can stay there it can
manifest<00:07:32.580> itself<00:07:33.030> decades<00:07:33.840> later<00:07:34.169> in<00:07:34.560> another

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
manifest itself decades later in another

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.029 
manifest itself decades later in another
form<00:07:35.310> of<00:07:35.599> chickenpox<00:07:36.599> called<00:07:37.110> shingles<00:07:37.560> and

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
form of chickenpox called shingles and

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:40.670 
form of chickenpox called shingles and
so<00:07:38.580> it's<00:07:38.819> the<00:07:38.969> same<00:07:39.240> DNA<00:07:39.780> that's<00:07:40.199> just<00:07:40.409> been

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
so it's the same DNA that's just been

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.260 
so it's the same DNA that's just been
hitchhiking<00:07:41.310> around<00:07:41.400> waiting<00:07:41.969> and<00:07:42.150> waiting

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
hitchhiking around waiting and waiting

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.990 
hitchhiking around waiting and waiting
so<00:07:42.599> it's<00:07:42.750> in<00:07:42.840> that<00:07:42.870> lysogenic<00:07:43.560> cycle<00:07:43.979> and<00:07:44.550> a

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
so it's in that lysogenic cycle and a

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.820 
so it's in that lysogenic cycle and a
lot<00:07:45.150> of<00:07:45.240> viruses<00:07:45.389> will<00:07:45.780> jump<00:07:46.080> between<00:07:46.259> the<00:07:46.650> two

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830 
lot of viruses will jump between the two

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.379 
lot of viruses will jump between the two
and<00:07:47.099> so<00:07:47.159> they'll<00:07:47.460> be<00:07:47.520> in<00:07:47.580> the<00:07:47.729> lysogenic<00:07:48.090> cycle

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:48.389 
and so they'll be in the lysogenic cycle

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.480 
and so they'll be in the lysogenic cycle
cold<00:07:49.139> sores<00:07:49.439> on<00:07:49.740> the<00:07:49.830> mouth<00:07:50.039> would<00:07:50.280> be<00:07:50.400> an

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490 
cold sores on the mouth would be an

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.640 
cold sores on the mouth would be an
example<00:07:50.759> of<00:07:51.000> that<00:07:51.060> it's<00:07:51.750> just<00:07:51.870> hiding<00:07:52.229> in<00:07:52.530> your

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.650 
example of that it's just hiding in your

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.379 
example of that it's just hiding in your
neural<00:07:53.009> cells<00:07:53.280> all<00:07:53.610> of<00:07:53.759> a<00:07:53.789> sudden<00:07:54.030> your<00:07:54.120> immune

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389 
neural cells all of a sudden your immune

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.060 
neural cells all of a sudden your immune
system<00:07:54.750> gets<00:07:54.960> depleted<00:07:55.319> they

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.070 
system gets depleted they

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.590 
system gets depleted they
into<00:07:56.370> the<00:07:56.490> lytic<00:07:56.730> cycle<00:07:56.760> make<00:07:57.210> a<00:07:57.240> bunch<00:07:57.480> of

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:57.600 
into the lytic cycle make a bunch of

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.060 
into the lytic cycle make a bunch of
copies<00:07:57.750> of<00:07:57.990> that<00:07:58.140> and<00:07:58.440> then<00:07:58.800> they<00:07:58.920> can

00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.070 
copies of that and then they can

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.980 
copies of that and then they can
eventually<00:07:59.220> go<00:07:59.640> back<00:07:59.850> and<00:08:00.210> so<00:08:00.630> those<00:08:00.810> are

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:00.990 
eventually go back and so those are

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.230 
eventually go back and so those are
viruses<00:08:01.440> are<00:08:01.650> they<00:08:01.800> alive<00:08:02.100> no<00:08:02.700> are<00:08:03.060> they

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 
viruses are they alive no are they

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.160 
viruses are they alive no are they
important<00:08:03.780> yes<00:08:04.290> and<00:08:04.590> I<00:08:04.710> hope<00:08:04.860> that's<00:08:05.010> helpful
