00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:13.490
 Hello Good evening Good morning update you sure you want fun and mathematics today 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:19.460
 Let's study today Think about the old pebbles of the course of dinosaur volume 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.720
 The method is kanji that you learn in junior high school, but the part that the formula holds is well known 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.520
 I don't think it's here today 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 Let's lead about 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.950
 The first is from the official review There is an old here 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.850
 The radius of the cattle was made r 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:40.829
 Find a volume of radius r 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.449
 The q volume of official lies will you part = 4/3 cup as follows calling on 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.449
 The volume of say that was the v 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.339
 I can not tell you at school what is going to happen 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:59.340
 I would like to learn here through this video 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:02.940
 Since integration is used in the same room, it will be high school level content 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 Let's look at the process of the room 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.409
 Please It looks all means to 's who put hourly wage 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.549
 Let me download 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:19.569
 So I cut the old into two here 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:21.180
 I will set up a coordinate system for the Hankyu that has made Hankyu as follows 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.050
 That is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.970
 Make the x and y axes look like this 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:36.810
 Bottom 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:42.680
 A scale is provided so that the ball umpire matches the origin of the intersection of the x and y axes . 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.840
 As preparation for the next step, consider the following: 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.630
 Consider a cutting plane at y = t 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.829
 What 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:58.550
 It is important that this aspect is the edge of this kind of noodle 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.250
 good for does 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.010
 yono lnt sound me 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.790
 Not say that 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:11.680
 I prepared the side view of this queue 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:17.230
 a It is that this head Well sectional view 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:21.710
 I do not know because it is viewed from the side, but y = t part is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:27.960
 The cutting surface is a circle 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:31.360
 I think that I want to do some various analysis using this figure 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.080
 Now from the origin yeah yeah 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.460
 I hit the line segment The length of this line segment is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.510
 Because it will be the radius of the whole holiday r 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:52.019
 And a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:54.340
 Place a large r arch r the radius of the circle of the cut surface in the y = t 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:00.160
 Then 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:06.850
 Please try to focus on this red triangle painted the color now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:11.110
 You could use Anne square theorem using a single square of the theorem and r circumstances 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:15.250
 It is large r circumstances large r circumstances many t letter upper = 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:19.060
 Small r circumstances become Una g 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.390
 A large r circumstances = small r circumstances- 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.560
 It will be called t circumstances 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.380
 Boiled 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.450
 r 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.900
 Rajaliko route small r circumstances -t circumstances 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:40.380
 You can transform the expression like this 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:44.940
 It was Motomari is the radius of the circle of the cut surface in the y = t this way 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:50.880
 Hey but it is does not seem energy out to the mud a little t 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.150
 We will determine the area of a circle of the cut surface in the = t mean that 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.069
 It appeared again without Hankyu 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.130
 In this hemisphere 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.370
 The position of t is here 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:10.690
 The cut surface at t is such 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:14.680
 The radius of this circle will be the large r just like this. 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:22.389
 Let y be the area of the cutting plane at t 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:30.340
 Place Large 8 and to the charge = I will say that Pairaji r deputy director 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:33.770
 This means that = square bracket r circumstances- 11 section closing parenthesis 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.220
 Animal bible 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.500
 Yes I have seen over 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:48.000
 The preparation for integration is now complete. 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:51.870
 It is determined from the first of Hankyu Oishi instead of obtaining suddenly the volume of q 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.160
 It is the site of the 2-minute time I wish 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:02.040
 The two-minute part is applied as too much using the integral equation 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.070
 2 minutes = Integral zero to r 's ad adt 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:11.810
 is not it 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:14.310
 The meaning of this integration is like slicing Hankyu from the bottom into a small slice 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.320
 Please think about it 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:23.640
 It is what was really finely slice was this finely sliced 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.760
 One of volume one which was asked earlier 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:34.300
 It will be equal to the area a 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:36.030
 It is possible to add all of these sliced pieces one by one and the meaning of the sentence 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.600
 It was 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:45.060
 Substitute what we found earlier into the charge a part 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.100
 = From the integral zero of r pi brackets r circumstances - t-shape on past Close dt 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:53.260
 It will be said 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:56.470
 It looks like this when the issue before further pie and circle it 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.220
 And the rest is the integral calculation 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.460
 It becomes like this when calculating the integral 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:09.910
 In this way it will look like this on the day 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:17.650
 I'm sorry I would like to omit the method of calculating the integral 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:19.420
 Yes it stopped here 2/3 Paiaru misery that this is Hankyu Oishi 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.940
 Have obeyed 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.800
 The volume v of q is 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:31.330
 Part = not will be referred to as the four losses r devastation of half 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:36.740
 More than double the volume of Hankyu 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:38.560
 Class of heavy snow of the carbohydrate was cheers for good work I will work 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:45.190
 I wonder how it was 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:49.330
 If you are not used to computing integrals, it might have been difficult. 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:55.030
 This is how you get to understand the meaning of the integral 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:57.480
 If you look at the official staff you learned from long ago, math will be quite interesting 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:01.440
 I wonder if you can 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.710
 Goodbye goodbye So also in the Let's also horse meet 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.710
