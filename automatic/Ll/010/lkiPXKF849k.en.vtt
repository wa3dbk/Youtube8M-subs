it<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.020> -<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.380> thought<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.950> Soviets<00:02:14.400> may<00:02:14.550> have

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
couple seconds that I thought that the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.990 
couple seconds that I thought that the
US<00:02:19.379> team<00:02:19.620> was<00:02:19.799> going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.159> pull<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.519> out
