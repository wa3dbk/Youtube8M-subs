00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
to build the like a wave gun in the Lego

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.140 
to build the like a wave gun in the Lego
baby<00:00:09.510> gun<00:00:10.280> show<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.340> how<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> build<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.910> baby

baby gun show you how to build a baby

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.340 
baby gun show you how to build a baby
gun<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.440> need<00:00:13.769> cone<00:00:14.719> two<00:00:15.719> cylinders<00:00:18.350> one

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
gun so you need cone two cylinders one

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.090 
gun so you need cone two cylinders one
of<00:00:19.500> those<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> those<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> will<00:00:22.890> need<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
of those one of those you will need a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.089 
of those one of those you will need a
pistol<00:00:23.910> piece<00:00:24.410> square<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:26.300> two<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
pistol piece square in two of these and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.080 
pistol piece square in two of these and
you<00:00:29.730> knew<00:00:29.880> barros<00:00:31.969> start<00:00:32.969> by<00:00:33.360> attaching<00:00:35.090> two

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you knew barros start by attaching two

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:48.380 
you knew barros start by attaching two
cylinders<00:00:36.899> together<00:00:38.120> show<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:47.390> then

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
cylinders together show you that go then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.319 
cylinders together show you that go then
attach<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.379> call<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:50.100> onto<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> end<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
attach the call right onto the end of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
attach the call right onto the end of
the<00:00:51.449> cylinder<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> looks<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the cylinder so looks like that then I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.779 
the cylinder so looks like that then I
attach<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.780> hook<00:00:58.199> right<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> end<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
attach the hook right to the end it of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.530 
attach the hook right to the end it of
the<00:01:00.390> other<00:01:00.570> cylinder<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.359> looks<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
the other cylinder so looks like that

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.310 
the other cylinder so looks like that
then<00:01:06.540> attach<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:08.900> little<00:01:09.900> gun<00:01:10.320> piece<00:01:10.710> right

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
then attach the little gun piece right

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.910 
then attach the little gun piece right
behind<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.810> little<00:01:16.280> piece<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:18.630> hook

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.370 

so<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.890> then<00:01:23.979> catch<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.330> square<00:01:25.330> one<00:01:26.170> by

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
so that and then catch the square one by

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.999 
so that and then catch the square one by
one<00:01:26.680> right<00:01:27.340> attack<00:01:27.909> against<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.729> pistol

piece<00:01:33.930> rate<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:40.570> catch<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:45.580> this

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
piece rate that then catch this is this

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.580 
piece rate that then catch this is this
and<00:01:46.420> touch<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:49.170> two<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:52.479> cylinders<00:01:53.350> i

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
and touch the two other cylinders i

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.520 
and touch the two other cylinders i
should<00:01:53.800> say<00:01:54.119> wait<00:01:55.409> come<00:01:56.409> be<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:59.340> like<00:02:00.340> that

that then attach a blue like rectangle
piece<00:03:48.030> right<00:03:48.990> there<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.660> should<00:03:52.110> look<00:03:52.410> like

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
piece right there so it should look like

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.350 
piece right there so it should look like
this<00:03:55.220> then<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.400> has<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> two<00:03:57.750> green<00:03:58.020> spot
