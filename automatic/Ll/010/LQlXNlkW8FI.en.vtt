00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
I've had that problem for a while some

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.200 
I've had that problem for a while some
days<00:04:26.080> it'll<00:04:26.380> do<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.770> some<00:04:27.430> days<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.820> won't<00:04:27.970> I

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
days it'll do it some days it won't I

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.140

like regular back on thursday so it

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.530 
like regular back on thursday so it

probably flared it up then and just just

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.220 
probably flared it up then and just just
escalated<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.620> because<00:04:38.890> some<00:04:39.100> days<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.810> do<00:04:40.810> legs

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230
