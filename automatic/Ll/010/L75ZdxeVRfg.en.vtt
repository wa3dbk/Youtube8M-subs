 create some 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.590
 a superhero competition that will burst 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.859
 like a bubble 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.079
 Putin's club site earlier that time 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.739
 in order to convince the real 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.869
 man in front of you need to be 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:19.949
 an observer 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.489
 will need 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.510
 entities by another person and not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.719
 if they really 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.809
 capitalists talk 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.169
 it is quite simple and complicated 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.859
 here so on this main body is 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.959
 is done 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.229
 but 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.179
 then you can move somewhere and if not 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.899
 there will be moments sincerity of the moment 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.429
 presence in a relationship 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.379
 then any further klimochkin 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.980
 engineering project trainings workshops and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.630
 apotheker Volodya 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.810
 Iraqi simply is not as well 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.240
 seduce a man how to seduce 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.349
 a woman they decided a year on fuel 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.900
 worldview on the body pictures of which 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.629
 flowers of the soul and not take root relationship 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.389
 which will naturally 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.059
 attitude to this 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.049
 don't get that deep because 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.810
 root new 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.569
 if you can handle the root 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.160
 sincerity appearance 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.529
 insolvent 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:11.989
 then the techniques here 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.019
 not needed but will come 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.299
 from a specific situation a specific 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.569
 minute specifically man they are by 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.629
 non-tech patterns 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.960
 through exercise 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.170
 which can be a daunting book 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.849
 will give 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.449
 because this someone wrote the dolls this 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.169
 works 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.639
 but this is not your life your life it is 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.039
 this moment 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.219
 I was someone training centers 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.289
 Where 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.009
 conducts such training outsiders 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.599
 happens bookstores no damn 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.809
 shelves occupied by books how to be 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.109
 bitch 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.759
 but as I see most books on 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.139
 typology is not based on later on simple 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.269
 principle what you need 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.049
 build relationships when you know 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.119
 the principle that a man needs 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.699
 what is it when you know the pain points 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.889
 men and at the right moment 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.019
 press them to get what you 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.079
 want to 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.079
 and as a result is being built 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.659
 all so glib always interesting 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.549
 passionate relationship 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.449
 and then life begins 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:19.120
 arise 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 I can then purchase more 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.139
 deep relationship 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.039
 and it is good if what you read 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.169
 will be forgotten and if cole will not be forgotten to me 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.830
 it seems that this is the foundation 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.939
 again for insincerity 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.050
 and recently injured 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.300
 problems in your life together
