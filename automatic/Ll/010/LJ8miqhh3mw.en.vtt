this is virtually a bit more interesting

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:33.300 
this is virtually a bit more interesting
what<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.240> hell<00:04:23.389> is<00:04:23.509> that<00:04:23.539> guy<00:04:23.780> doing

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.850 

whoop-dee-doo<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:35.330> some<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.750> then<00:04:35.930> I'm

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
whoop-dee-doo so some of that then I'm

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.080 
whoop-dee-doo so some of that then I'm
going<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.160> be<00:04:37.250> doing<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.490> lot

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.340 

and<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:43.720> can<00:04:43.930> really<00:04:44.410> see<00:04:45.660> where<00:04:46.660> wipeout<00:04:47.169> was

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
and you can really see where wipeout was

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.000 
and you can really see where wipeout was
coming<00:04:47.620> from<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:49.199> don't<00:04:50.199> know<00:04:50.320> if<00:04:50.380> wipeout<00:04:50.740> came

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
coming from I don't know if wipeout came

00:04:51.010 --> 00:05:02.500 
coming from I don't know if wipeout came
before<00:04:51.220> this<00:04:51.840> certainly<00:04:52.840> came<00:04:53.110> after<00:04:53.590> s<00:04:54.040> 0<00:04:54.550> nez

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.020 

this<00:05:03.140> lacks<00:05:03.440> be<00:05:03.680> gripped<00:05:04.070> but<00:05:04.640> then<00:05:04.790> you<00:05:04.880> could

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
this lacks be gripped but then you could

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.760 
this lacks be gripped but then you could
say<00:05:05.150> that<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.390> all<00:05:05.480> Nintendo<00:05:06.050> games<00:05:06.350> I<00:05:06.530> find

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
say that of all Nintendo games I find

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:17.760 
say that of all Nintendo games I find
them<00:05:06.890> so<00:05:07.070> soft<00:05:08.830> yeah

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.879 

I<00:05:17.830> think<00:05:18.520> ultimately<00:05:19.110> there<00:05:20.110> is<00:05:20.259> no<00:05:20.440> problem

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
I think ultimately there is no problem

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.550 
I think ultimately there is no problem
with<00:05:21.039> this<00:05:21.190> game<00:05:21.599> to<00:05:22.599> be<00:05:22.750> fair<00:05:23.020> there's

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
with this game to be fair there's

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.260 
with this game to be fair there's
nothing<00:05:23.919> wrong<00:05:24.099> with<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.340> whatsoever<00:05:27.270> I'm

nothing wrong with it whatsoever I'm

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.779 
nothing wrong with it whatsoever I'm
just<00:05:28.629> really<00:05:28.900> not<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.110> Nintendo<00:05:29.740> person<00:05:32.789> that's
