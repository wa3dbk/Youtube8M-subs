00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 look at cooking and cooking rice 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 pilaf an important cooking because 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.210
 let's talk to me, fabio told me of one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.920
 millennial millennial cooking but yes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 he also thinks from ancient Egypt therefore 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.539
 resolves neither to almost naturally cooked 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 reprocessed natural temperature and this 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 is the pilaf culture in Greek it seems that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 Pilaf means cooked rice 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.949
 so very natural and I also brought 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.949
 a negative example 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 this is an example of rice salads 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.370
 because I brought it because I often did 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 happen to eat them when I go around 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 these laughs stamp anyone who is me 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.850
 I saw many eyes however, this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 initial of traditional rituals often 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 they are made boiled that optimal also 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.870
 overcooked and then they bring us so many vegetables 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.270
 maybe pickled in oil not cheeses 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.630
 cheeses there are those who put us there too 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.590
 this may leave us here adaptive 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 aside it 's fine and we've seen how 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 obviously make as many rices as others 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 sometimes not just this tv wellness 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.240
 week with a little shelled fat and then 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.760
 these hours I'm ready to do 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.130
 Rice salads is another thing 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.450
 soft and grainy and an advice that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 I can give immediately when they prepare 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 rice salads so the rice does 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 leave in the fridge but separately 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.490
 because one of the errors and put the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 rice at too low temperatures yes 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
 ruin the starchy part almost becomes 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 grainy so better to keep them in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.100
 refrigerator in a slightly warmer part 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.220
 and we could really say so many things but 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 I often let it mature do it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 net result that oil and lemon then 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.920
 rice guided just became a little more 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.500
 chill them a disc with a juice of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
 I mix it well with lemon and oil and leave it 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.399
 covered outside the refrigerator because 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.930
 so there is no bacterial proliferation e 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.520
 matures just before they arrive 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.240
 we indulge them with vegetables 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.850
 as we like 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.100
 I immediately go to this technique then 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.519
 I prepared a casserole this is one 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.570
 tall casserole is easy 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.700
 this is an onion that is not good 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.510
 when it is so it is ruined we leave from 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.189
 part for today 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.480
 for example well did you see that 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.799
 it's not good that it's not good because it is 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.780
 been too much in the sunlight 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.459
 becoming green but one thing is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.500
 interesting are the onions this is 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.810
 just the classic picket the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.450
 clove that is spicy yes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.159
 staple the onion so it keeps still 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 flaps and the nail does not disperse and into 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.659
 rice the butter that you always put 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.220
 we keep in mind that it does not need it 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.129
 we don't need the flavor a lot 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.459
 butter it puts a little bit now seen 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.989
 very little on the bottom it serves 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.140
 therefore it is necessary to make it brown 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.890
 four person heat conductor 10 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.470
 grams 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.389
 then we just have to toast the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.720
 onions and in this case dream 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.840
 used an industrial rice the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.370
 par boiler so well known because there 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.260
 I wanted to say that the par boyle is not 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.989
 a variety of rice is a process 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.879
 so all the varieties of rice that you 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.859
 they can be found on the market 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.079
 made tramps and treatment too 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.459
 this secular that comes practically 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.930
 precooked 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.069
 there are studies that say it remains 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500
 however rich in nutrients 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.329
 although not fiber and allows one 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.919
 cooking also piras quiet me but 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.290
 so this type of cooking is 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.859
 exclusive for the nose pina between we can 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.590
 to adopt 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.290
 no, but we can adopt everyone divided 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.819
 up to the semi-complete the interim in 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.090
 together integral because integrated e 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.590
 too much fiber and we certainly can't 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.849
 sure then we do this operation 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.970
 vegetable broths without ever mixing it with 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.370
 cover and just to respect a 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.400
 good pil up technique or on fire in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 oven we do not mix it covers let's say 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.400
 with a 2 centimeter of broth and then how 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.739
 always as always put the flame 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 under the light heat because 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.680
 the intent is to achieve 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.840
 a right temperature for cooking 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.579
 you don't need this yes otherwise yes 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.620
 therefore it attacks just like in ancient times 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.239
 it was done cover with the lid 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.949
 traditional and even better with magic 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.049
 cooker forms the steam room 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.310
 we do other things do not stick 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.229
 nothing happens 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.659
 once ready we have this 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.240
 result is good to do in the hall has 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.919
 mocked cold is rice salads falls a 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.389
 suggestion I want to give again for 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.219
 I prefer the rice initial 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.200
 let the rice ripen as I have it 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.009
 said and prepare a nice bowl of 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.689
 vegetate 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.759
 also of meat what we want fish 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.309
 mixed and just before they arrive 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.559
 Guests guests mix them together 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.899
 because vegetables often have water and 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:44.759
 do and ruin the rice then the dough 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.669
 at the last moment combine both the vegetables 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.529
 that protein does protein is fine 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.449
 also but the vegetable that especially at the 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.430
 steam that has so much water is likely to 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.740
 ruin the rice so right into 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.360
 last put the venerate one my second 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.099
 you since we're talking about this 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.219
 kind of rice especially with what 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.860
 the better it is because it is this rice 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.939
 pilaf in the modern kitchen we talk about 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.229
 modern we talk about the kitchen 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.610
 of the nineteenth century of the twentieth century that I have 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.339
 had so many evolutions 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.199
 the pilot is paired meats think that 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:15.599
 an ancient recipe known to the world 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.180
 of the stroke on off and the straw with offers 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.339
 an ox meat macerated in 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.309
 lemon juice and then cooked 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.979
 and rice pilaf in this way I go immediately 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:29.189
