00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.559
 Back to top of the page up there ^ 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.130
 to the top on tv 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.080
 in this video that already do is present the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.640
 cabinet there that complete max sette a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.560
 machine configuration you will see in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.710
 description and people are testing 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 performance of the machine during the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.590
 some videos right and today's video 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.460
 people are going to show the f3 and from home the people 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.210
 already throwing ray that the video card 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 in question the gtx 560 and we will test 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.480
 remembering being personal I do not know how to play 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 right bf3 is brand new is more 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.610
 This is not the case here. 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
 which will show that it is the sound of fps 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 we serve we are also not for you 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 where to go 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.260
 any place closed or danilo focal fps 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:13.030
 the place open here remembering that it is 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:16.620
 in hype only in full logical HD did not have 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.620
 open place here where the bug catches 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 keep or do not believe 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.830
 obi pse being sincere people are not 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.830
 very nice is falling a lot and 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.399
 play here 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.979
 And how have I fallen when I go to 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.979
 apartment then you have already seen ne 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.009
 henry just because you 're filming are 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.420
 killing that not a personal crazy then the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.430
 what are we going to do now? 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.119
 Okay, I'll go there for the most part. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 open before changing other pro're the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.630
 game is more or less comfortable is 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.300
 independent 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.830
 defending from ethanol goes up and 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.570
 descends the fps 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.350
 but even if we could get 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:28.230
 here on the grid to see how it will look 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:31.890
 besides battle and that was going to make listen 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.200
 santa then we were between 40 and 40 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 and 60 faithful will gain much 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.780
 we have other vain map details 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.500
 vote now to see how it goes 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.500
 keep this here 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.200
 People, I do not know what this or that is. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.460
 You better watch the species get worse. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.620
 enough 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.480
 The game is not very comfortable. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.680
 on the contrary it is very strange to play 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 I do not even know where I've got here. 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.969
 the afak over there 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 is in ultra personal fps do not stand so 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.430
 low for gtx 550 ti was not what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.630
 we expected because this set is 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.220
 much better 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.880
 SÃ©rgio remembers that the configuration is in 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:42.970
 low but fps is already going to 30 we'll see the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.970
 that guy get him 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.780
 Then I think it was good, it's just coming back. 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.610
 focus is not my type of egg is a fps 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.340
 how much is the performance of the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.519
 machine with a set of three that is one 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.340
 super heavyweight game but fbi does not pay anything 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:11.110
 by staff did not fall from 30 until then 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 but varies a lot from map to map and from 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.590
 situation when you are 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.419
 with a you 're playing with such a grenade 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.870
 A lot of people on the map screen have little 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.370
 People are like 19 x 10 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.979
 so the game may be a 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.250
 just over there also notes that the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.630
 I did not take the set as a whole either. 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.870
 it's not so bad either 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.729
 it is very good so the customer is in the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.880
 panel that will sing just one more 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.410
 little show how much 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.680
 here with the joke 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:50.639
 if this building leads nowhere 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:54.090
 I think it's not just personal 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.949
 You got me every day, you will not run from 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.590
 that I 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.020
 the staff is this you could see through 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.259
 Numbers playing in thunder can not 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.289
 difficult to download from 40 play in one or the other 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:10.349
 difficult to pass from 45 only that stays with the 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.969
 minimum of 30 and sometimes beauty falls 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.279
 so people have to show 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.259
 here you did some more detail 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.909
 makes the next video 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.319
 the next test we'll do or 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.659
 with that machine even if we do one 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.550
 test you want us to do 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.689
 the different map that we do not know 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.279
 a lot of game 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.639
 good staff so if you liked a young 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:33.360
 So we'll sign up for the channel, this is 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.849
 to sow 560 right continue 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.699
 Look at her description , there's everything. 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.259

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.240
 set in them 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.719
