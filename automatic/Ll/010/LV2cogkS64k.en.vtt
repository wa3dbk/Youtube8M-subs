before<00:00:28.610> purchasing<00:00:29.610> easy<00:00:29.820> tracks<00:00:30.180> we<00:00:30.420> took<00:00:30.660> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
before purchasing easy tracks we took a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.749 
before purchasing easy tracks we took a
look<00:00:30.930> at<00:00:31.110> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> other<00:00:32.279> software

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
look at a lot of the other software

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.950 
look at a lot of the other software

was going to help us with all three of

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.299 
was going to help us with all three of
those<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.170> decided<00:01:01.589> to<00:01:01.709> go<00:01:01.889> with<00:01:02.039> easy

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
those when we decided to go with easy

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
those when we decided to go with easy
tracks<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.969> made<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> investment<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.379> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
tracks we made the investment but we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.870 
tracks we made the investment but we
knew<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.009> just<00:01:05.219> the<00:01:05.339> beginning<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
knew that was just the beginning of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.179 
knew that was just the beginning of the
process<00:01:06.350> investing<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> software<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.159> not

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
process investing in the software is not

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
process investing in the software is not
going<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> solution<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.240> itself<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to be a solution in itself we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.319 
going to be a solution in itself we
realize<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.579> take<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:12.149> at

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
realize that we have to take a look at

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:13.910 
realize that we have to take a look at
of<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.840> our<00:01:12.930> processes<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.770> procedures

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of all of our processes and procedures

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
of all of our processes and procedures
the<00:01:14.850> way<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.240> were<00:01:15.420> doing<00:01:15.750> things<00:01:15.960> before<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the way we were doing things before and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
the way we were doing things before and
how<00:01:17.250> ideally<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.180> would<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.450> doing<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.869> under

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
how ideally we would be doing them under

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.859 
how ideally we would be doing them under
the<00:01:19.200> system<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.579> we<00:01:20.880> spent<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> period<00:01:21.659> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the system and so we spent a period of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
the system and so we spent a period of
about<00:01:22.020> six<00:01:22.170> months<00:01:23.570> implementing<00:01:24.570> easy

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
about six months implementing easy

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.349 
about six months implementing easy
tracks<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.219> goal<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.579> being<00:01:27.000> fully

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
tracks we had a goal of being fully

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.330 
tracks we had a goal of being fully
implemented<00:01:28.109> within<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.859> end<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.219> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
implemented within that end of that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
implemented within that end of that
six-month<00:01:29.880> period<00:01:30.270> meaning<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:31.229> routes<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
six-month period meaning all routes and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
six-month period meaning all routes and
all<00:01:32.039> of<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.310> processes<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.149> be<00:01:33.270> using<00:01:33.659> easy

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
all of our processes would be using easy

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
all of our processes would be using easy
tracks<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> its<00:01:34.530> fullest<00:01:34.859> extent<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> best

to get item level tracking we viewed
item<00:02:31.710> level<00:02:31.860> tracking<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.490> very<00:02:32.760> important

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
item level tracking is a very important

to implement item level tracking we knew

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.170 
to implement item level tracking we knew
was<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:37.980> only<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> help<00:02:38.850> us<00:02:38.940> with

way it would have improved our sales we

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
way it would have improved our sales we
felt<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.160> knew<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.640> was

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
felt like was if we knew what was

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910 
felt like was if we knew what was
selling<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:48.840> could<00:02:48.990> figure<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.530> more<00:02:49.770> we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
selling we could figure out what more we

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.949 
selling we could figure out what more we
needed<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.280> stock<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.880> what<00:02:51.300> wasn't<00:02:51.510> selling

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
needed a stock and what wasn't selling

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.330 
needed a stock and what wasn't selling
we<00:02:52.080> knew<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:52.470> would<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.070> need<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
we knew we would know what we need to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.550 
we knew we would know what we need to
drop<00:02:53.580> using<00:02:54.330> easy<00:02:54.510> tracks<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.110> were<00:02:55.260> able<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
drop using easy tracks we were able to

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.280 
drop using easy tracks we were able to
determine<00:02:56.209> exactly<00:02:57.209> how<00:02:57.450> many<00:02:57.510> products<00:02:58.170> were

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
determine exactly how many products were

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.530 
determine exactly how many products were
in<00:02:58.500> each<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.890> our<00:02:58.980> machines<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.700> we<00:03:00.120> realized

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
in each of our machines and we realized

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.120 
in each of our machines and we realized
that<00:03:00.690> although<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.080> were<00:03:01.350> stocking<00:03:01.620> hundreds

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that although we were stocking hundreds

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.350 
that although we were stocking hundreds
and<00:03:02.250> hundreds<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> products<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.300> our

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
and hundreds of products in our

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.750 
and hundreds of products in our
warehouse<00:03:03.630> they<00:03:04.470> weren't<00:03:04.740> making<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
warehouse they weren't making it all the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.910 
warehouse they weren't making it all the
way<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.450> our<00:03:06.540> machines<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.170> fact<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
way to all of our machines in fact the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.830 
way to all of our machines in fact the
reason<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.459> stock<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.180> products<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.690> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
reason to stock a lot of products is to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.540 
reason to stock a lot of products is to
provide<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.170> rotation<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.980> product<00:03:11.370> through

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
provide that rotation of product through

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.220 
provide that rotation of product through
the<00:03:11.670> machine<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> customers<00:03:12.630> see<00:03:12.780> variety

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the machine so the customers see variety

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.010 
the machine so the customers see variety
but<00:03:14.130> when<00:03:14.550> we<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.060> system<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> place<00:03:15.660> we

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
but when we have the system in place we

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
but when we have the system in place we
realized<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> variety<00:03:17.250> wasn't<00:03:17.640> there

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
realized that the variety wasn't there

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.250 
realized that the variety wasn't there
because<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.239> products<00:03:18.660> weren't<00:03:18.930> changing

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
because the products weren't changing

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.410 
because the products weren't changing
through<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.620> machines<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.209> times

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
through the machines a lot of times

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.030 
through the machines a lot of times
products<00:03:21.840> were<00:03:21.930> placed<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.440> machines<00:03:22.800> based

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
products were placed in machines based

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
products were placed in machines based
on<00:03:23.160> driver<00:03:23.400> preferences<00:03:24.090> not<00:03:24.269> necessarily

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
on driver preferences not necessarily

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.140 
on driver preferences not necessarily
because<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.260> customer<00:03:25.739> preferences<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.790> using

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
because of customer preferences so using

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.580 
because of customer preferences so using
easy<00:03:27.330> tracks<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:27.930> were<00:03:27.959> able<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.470> actually

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
easy tracks we were able to actually

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.290 
easy tracks we were able to actually
drop<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.370> number<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.760> items<00:03:29.880> we<00:03:30.180> were

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
drop the number of items we were

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.090 
drop the number of items we were
stocking<00:03:30.570> for<00:03:30.870> snack<00:03:31.110> machines<00:03:31.530> from<00:03:31.709> about

like<00:05:29.070> if<00:05:29.430> we<00:05:29.460> had<00:05:29.700> another<00:05:29.730> software<00:05:30.420> system

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
like if we had another software system

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.470 
like if we had another software system
it<00:05:31.860> wouldn't<00:05:32.250> be<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:32.550> open<00:05:32.940> for<00:05:33.120> us<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.360> do

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
it wouldn't be so open for us to do

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.730 
it wouldn't be so open for us to do
those<00:05:33.720> cool<00:05:33.990> things<00:05:34.020> we<00:05:34.410> would<00:05:34.530> have<00:05:34.620> been<00:05:34.680> a

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
those cool things we would have been a

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.190 
those cool things we would have been a
little<00:05:34.950> bit<00:05:35.160> limited<00:05:35.700> in<00:05:35.820> how<00:05:36.420> we<00:05:36.480> built<00:05:37.050> our

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
little bit limited in how we built our

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.320 
little bit limited in how we built our
business<00:05:37.230> if<00:05:37.800> we<00:05:38.190> didn't<00:05:38.490> have<00:05:38.520> easy<00:05:38.820> track<00:05:39.150> so

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
business if we didn't have easy track so

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.880 
business if we didn't have easy track so
I'm<00:05:39.420> really<00:05:39.750> happy<00:05:39.960> with<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.320> decision<00:05:40.770> we

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
I'm really happy with the decision we

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.070 
I'm really happy with the decision we
made<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.280> go<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.460> easy<00:05:41.700> tracks<00:05:42.030> because<00:05:42.810> what<00:05:43.050> I

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
made to go to easy tracks because what I

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.490 
made to go to easy tracks because what I
couldn't<00:05:43.530> have<00:05:43.710> imagined<00:05:44.250> back<00:05:44.400> then<00:05:44.730> I<00:05:45.500> am

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
couldn't have imagined back then I am

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.830 
couldn't have imagined back then I am
doing<00:05:46.740> today<00:05:47.040> so<00:05:47.640> what<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:47.970> couldn't<00:05:48.390> imagine<00:05:48.600> I

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
doing today so what I couldn't imagine I

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.170 
doing today so what I couldn't imagine I
was<00:05:48.960> going<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.170> do<00:05:49.440> i<00:05:49.710> am<00:05:50.310> doing<00:05:50.520> today<00:05:50.790> and

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
was going to do i am doing today and

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.700 
was going to do i am doing today and
what<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.390> easy<00:05:51.690> tracks<00:05:52.020> has<00:05:52.260> allowed<00:05:52.470> us<00:05:52.530> to

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
what the easy tracks has allowed us to

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.280 
what the easy tracks has allowed us to
grow<00:05:53.040> with<00:05:53.250> that<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.700> use<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.540> data<00:05:54.750> in<00:05:55.020> new

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
grow with that and use the data in new

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.860 
grow with that and use the data in new
and<00:05:55.500> different<00:05:55.560> ways
