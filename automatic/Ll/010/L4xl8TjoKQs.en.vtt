00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.889
 find today for a new you 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.599
 you're on the map may day so it's a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.370
 tutorial to kill the big shit bastards 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.750
 kraken and yes I finally managed to the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.570
 kill so and in the company of the big 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.699
 machine for 7 for this part so the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 chain sat1 his chain will be in the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.730
 description I was also in company 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.960
 of two people we knew because 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 that we are partly public for the dome 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810
 xp we did not have microbes and that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 so it's even hotter and we have 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
 managed to escape what finally I'm happy 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.669
 to have fled with guys with whom we 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 did not talk so who establish a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.610
 strategy it was pretty hot even though 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 the guys frankly he imputes a level 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280
 and it's better than me that I have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 confess 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 especially one had 1.5 nancy relics 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 I am also a little dedication a to z 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.230
 just who has been with me 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.660
 from the beginning for the parties on 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.950
 made is so in this video I'm going 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 explain how to easily kill 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.230
 the kraken is also my opinion on the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.670
 map even hate that I deny 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 still not given so we will start 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 first of all with things 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 indispensable to arrive at 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.630
 kraken first of all that there are some 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.220
 players who is venom x1 at least 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.570
 coyette everywhere aliens around the guy who 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.420
 to the turret so the guy and the turret 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 we'll see that a bit later so I 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.060
 you were saying for wii so in case if 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 a big part to the aliens around the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.759
 dude in turn they now have these 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.409
 ammunition of venom that kills all that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.939
 surrounds so I recommend besides the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.880
 blue or red venom it's the most 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
 effective then then in equipment 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.759
 should know one who deals with 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.979
 shielding maximize 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.000
 another explosive ammunition I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 think it's the most effective 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.009
 explosives improve to the maximum and 2 which 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.420
 deals with the vulture improved to the max 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 also because the vulture is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.180
 far more effective than news on 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 my day because the towers is my case 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
 of alien level of the kraken bah it jumps 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.369
 everywhere on the towers and that's used to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 nothing to spend 2000 points for that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.649
 slab the motor home less it follows you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.630
 all over 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's a great friends at least they will you 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.049
 will not leave and you have it allies do not 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.180
 can not reach him many times 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.240
 so there is one of the two guys who 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.150
 deals with the vulture put themselves at both 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.030
 turret locations so that's 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.700
 when you come down to the place 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.320
 of clashes I had it like that for 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.290
 confront and kraken in front of you at 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.850
 left to right there will be two places of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.200
 turrets available so I'll you 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.830
 recommend but put yourself on the side 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.130
 opposed to the fund kraken would be better 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.450
 to be able to touch it 1 is like that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.800
 that's at least the one who looks after the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.480
 canvas so I remember kim a vulture 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.820
 to defend themselves and already that all 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.880
 others must also defend himself in 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.470
 just putting around 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.630
 then when there will be the explosion 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.310
 finally at least when the kraken will pose 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.980
 its tentacles to release its gas at 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.680
 ground put all of you on the nest of 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.240
 turrets that is next to the player who 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.590
 control the turret yet you can 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.510
 put in the middle or the other by passing 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.280
 good on not very effective for 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.080
 defend what the turret is so 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.750
 then attached to the tower and until the fact 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.590
 a lot around and the good is handled 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.320
 mexico and at the turret they have to 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.410
 aim and shoot in in the small circle 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.640
 as you see on the screen elsewhere 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.530
 in the small circle that is in the center of 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 the kraken's head is here too 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.700
 effective and besides when the kraken 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 puts down its tentacles and puts gas in 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.330
 soil for me i call it gaj know 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.040
 not if that's right so that's where he can 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.739
 lose more life so there do not hesitate 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.680
 if you literally bombard two 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.060
 bullets so turret ball and lives 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.709
 so here is there I have nothing else to 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.030
 say just poor and maximum stuff and 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.800
 hold a guy what he says rounded during 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.090
 that the other three defend it here 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.769
 there is not much to say so I put 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.860
 the recapitulative ali takes in writing 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.590
 what to have and 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.300
 and then suddenly I have you when 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.680
 even give you my opinion on the tablecloth 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.210
 that I still have not given then this 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.510
 map for me between the three maps 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.400
 extinction is my favorite 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.420
 so there was still only three maps 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.430
 of extinction the other two are not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.810
 went out but this one I fuck it 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.670
 she is really excellent 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.720
 it is slightly less complicated to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.890
 nightfall because I have to confess that 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.110
 nightfall they put a trick and well 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.910
 we hurt the buttocks at my first name to 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.110
 tell it like it is fascinating to be 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.240
 good we do not all have the same level the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.110
 guys so my ideas but I find more 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.130
 Interestingly, what is less 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.500
 complicated but good is still 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.850
 a lot of action the kraken has 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.410
 killed frankly it's nice we have 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.360
 Toulon had to stress it is really me 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.660
 short to the suspense me frankly 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.220
 I love it it's really excellent and 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.750
 then we have a lot more fun there 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.250
 more things to do and venom 4 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.390
 different business and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.169
 constructions there are plenty of stuff to 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.150
 search everywhere 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.280
 it's really a note frankly 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.510
 I love there is not much to 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.640
 to add except that I love you so 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.890
 also if you have tested nightfall 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.270
 do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.490
 comment is this so at the level of 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.620
 commander tahri was all who 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.940
 I had to say simply 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.460
 just said how to kill the kraken and 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.840
 give my opinion no but you 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.000
 leave again with two three minutes 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.980
 of gameplay 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 for how to kill the kraken so in the end 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.060
 of video you will have the kinematics of 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.380

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.330

 do not wait, we're going to war we're going 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.639
 try to tackle on our own 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.470
 ground in his tackle doubt attacked 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.569
 since my sources have located a 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.160
 other colony cryptides twice more 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.960
 great than that of colorado your 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.520
 source is a dangerous terrorist

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.570
 as close 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.100
 1
