00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we just had to avoid that until the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.620 
we just had to avoid that until the
point

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
point

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.360

strong<00:02:13.990> enough<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> tower<00:02:14.440> dive<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:15.130> could

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
strong enough the tower dive we could

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.740 
strong enough the tower dive we could
start<00:02:15.550> our<00:02:15.790> diving<00:02:16.030> ham<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.390> doesn't<00:02:16.630> matter

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
start our diving ham it doesn't matter

if<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.170> poke<00:02:17.290> us<00:02:17.440> because<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.830> just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
if they can poke us because we can just

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.650 
if they can poke us because we can just
charge<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.340> them<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.090> had<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.330> wait<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.510> bit

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
charge at them so we had to wait a bit

for our team complicate a bit stronger

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.370 
for our team complicate a bit stronger
to<00:02:21.610> do<00:02:21.700> what<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:21.970> wanted<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:22.840> while<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> game

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
to do what we wanted so while the game

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
to do what we wanted so while the game
went<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.710> longer<00:02:24.340> than<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.910> guess<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.330> should

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
went on longer than I guess it should

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.870 
went on longer than I guess it should
have<00:02:25.630> maybe<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.070> how<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> team<00:02:27.610> comps

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
have maybe it is just how the team comps

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.100 
have maybe it is just how the team comps
go<00:02:28.030> when<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.330> have<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> poke<00:02:28.660> app<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.020> can

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
go when you have a poke app that can

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.330 
go when you have a poke app that can
wave<00:02:29.260> clear<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.890> don't<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.310> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
wave clear you don't really have that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.860 
wave clear you don't really have that
great<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.820> siege<00:02:31.000> comp<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.690> wait

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
great of a siege comp you have to wait

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.050 
great of a siege comp you have to wait
until<00:02:32.020> yours<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.530> comp<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.520> start<00:02:33.850> diving

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
until yours a comp can start diving

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.470 
until yours a comp can start diving
their<00:02:34.330> pool<00:02:34.540> comp<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.850> all<00:02:36.850> right<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.270> guys

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
their pool comp so all right you guys

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.730 
their pool comp so all right you guys
dived<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:37.990> well<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.350> guess<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.620> worked

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
dived really well so I guess that worked

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.860 
dived really well so I guess that worked
out<00:02:38.830> really<00:02:38.890> well<00:02:39.130> actually<00:02:39.370> move<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.120> our

rest<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.760> team's<00:02:48.910> goals<00:02:49.150> were<00:02:49.270> here<00:02:49.480> uh<00:02:50.070> well

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
rest the team's goals were here uh well

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.850 
rest the team's goals were here uh well
I<00:02:51.100> think<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.580> call<00:02:51.820> was<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.300> go<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.570> them<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.990> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
I think the call was to go on them and I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.680 
I think the call was to go on them and I
think<00:02:54.070> how<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.340> had<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.550> really<00:02:54.730> good<00:02:54.880> tornado<00:02:55.390> on

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
think how I had a really good tornado on

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.170 
think how I had a really good tornado on
to<00:02:55.990> Elise<00:02:56.320> which<00:02:56.860> basically<00:02:57.310> just<00:02:57.460> initiated

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
to Elise which basically just initiated

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.120 
to Elise which basically just initiated
the<00:02:58.270> fight<00:02:58.390> for<00:02:58.570> us<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.830> kind<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.010> just

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
the fight for us and it kind of just

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.250 
the fight for us and it kind of just
went<00:03:00.220> really<00:03:00.400> well<00:03:00.490> for<00:03:00.760> us<00:03:00.850> just<00:03:01.720> after<00:03:01.990> that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
went really well for us just after that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.780 
went really well for us just after that
like<00:03:02.410> they'd<00:03:02.710> had<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.220> run<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.550> they<00:03:03.610> couldn't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
like they'd had to run and they couldn't

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.610 
like they'd had to run and they couldn't
actually<00:03:03.970> bite<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.380> free<00:03:05.590> I

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
options because bot was losing top was

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960 
options because bot was losing top was
using<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.590> they<00:03:35.680> had<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.860> user<00:03:36.160> team<00:03:36.640> comp<00:03:36.850> to

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
using so they had a user team comp to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
they were too far behind to actually be

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.130 
they were too far behind to actually be
able<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.570> at<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.720> point<00:03:40.960> in<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
that all those champions should do well

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.270 
that all those champions should do well
in<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.140> lanes<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.500> they<00:04:17.620> were<00:04:17.680> picked<00:04:17.980> into

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
in the lanes that they were picked into

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.039 
in the lanes that they were picked into
so<00:04:18.700> what<00:04:18.910> was<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:19.209> allowed<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.720> guys<00:04:19.840> to

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
so what was it that allowed you guys to

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.810 
so what was it that allowed you guys to
come<00:04:20.200> out<00:04:20.380> either<00:04:20.560> even<00:04:20.980> or<00:04:21.040> ahead<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.549> every

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
come out either even or ahead of every

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.000 
come out either even or ahead of every
single<00:04:21.970> lane<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:23.200> wasn't<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.680> we<00:04:23.890> were

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
single lane so it wasn't that we were

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.350 
single lane so it wasn't that we were
killing<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.490> man<00:04:24.550> lane<00:04:24.820> that's<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.210> how<00:04:25.330> we

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
killing that man lane that's not how we

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.800 
killing that man lane that's not how we
were<00:04:25.570> winning<00:04:25.780> lane<00:04:26.050> where<00:04:26.470> when

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
were winning lane where when

Lane through our pressure and the times

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.790 
Lane through our pressure and the times
we<00:04:28.760> back<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.480> we<00:04:29.690> would<00:04:29.810> get<00:04:29.960> maybe<00:04:30.560> like<00:04:30.770> a

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
that we wouldn't be ready for just

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.820 
that we wouldn't be ready for just
because<00:04:50.810> we<00:04:50.930> had<00:04:51.050> control<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.470> map<00:04:51.650> and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
because we had control the map and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.400 
because we had control the map and
through<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.220> lanes<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.840> while<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.139> didn't

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
through the lanes so while it didn't

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.690 
through the lanes so while it didn't
seem<00:04:54.590> like<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:54.770> are<00:04:54.950> stronger<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.400> just<00:04:55.580> had

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
seem like we are stronger we just had

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.760 
seem like we are stronger we just had
map<00:04:55.910> control<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.690> yeah<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.590> went<00:04:57.740> a

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
map control so yeah and that went a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.870 
map control so yeah and that went a
little<00:04:57.889> for<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.130> guys<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.460> actually<00:04:58.669> let's<00:04:58.790> go

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
much they could do at that point when

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.270 
much they could do at that point when
we're<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.360> so<00:05:29.570> fed<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.110> they<00:05:30.800> can't<00:05:31.039> fight
