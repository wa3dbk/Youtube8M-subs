camp<00:02:01.170> has<00:02:01.410> better<00:02:01.710> defenses<00:02:02.370> due<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.850> fact

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
camp has better defenses due to the fact

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.090 
camp has better defenses due to the fact
that<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.479> covered<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.930> rocks<00:02:04.260> but<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that it's covered in rocks but the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.999 
that it's covered in rocks but the
difference<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.700> height<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
difference in height is very little the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.219 
difference in height is very little the
theorists<00:02:08.880> who<00:02:09.030> created<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.810> theory

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
theorists who created this theory

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
theorists who created this theory
believed<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.950> relicanth<00:02:11.580> migrated

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
believed that when relicanth migrated

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.690 
believed that when relicanth migrated
closer<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> shores<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:14.280> were<00:02:14.400> less

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
closer to the shores there were less

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.580 
closer to the shores there were less
Pokemon<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.360> would<00:02:15.510> pose<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> threat<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.410> it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
Pokemon that would pose a threat to it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.820 
Pokemon that would pose a threat to it
which<00:02:16.980> over<00:02:17.459> time<00:02:17.700> made<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> weaker<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.530> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which over time made it weaker this all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.800 
which over time made it weaker this all
makes<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.370> lot<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.580> sense<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.390> there's<00:02:21.600> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
makes a lot of sense but there's just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.460 
makes a lot of sense but there's just
one<00:02:22.100> gaping<00:02:23.100> hole<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.640> theory<00:02:24.470> almost

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
one gaping hole in this theory almost

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430 
one gaping hole in this theory almost
all<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.790> relicanth<00:02:26.790> pokedex<00:02:27.600> entries<00:02:28.110> state

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
all of relicanth pokedex entries state

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440 
all of relicanth pokedex entries state
that<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> hasn't<00:02:29.340> changed<00:02:29.370> since<00:02:30.180> ancient

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that it hasn't changed since ancient

that it hasn't changed since ancient
times<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:32.130> example<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.000> Pokemon<00:02:33.630> why<00:02:33.989> entry

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620

times for example it's Pokemon why entry
says<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.640> rare<00:02:36.600> Pokemon<00:02:37.260> discovered

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
says this a rare Pokemon discovered

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.910 
says this a rare Pokemon discovered
during<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.280> deep-sea<00:02:38.820> exploration<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:40.380> has<00:02:40.590> not

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
during a deep-sea exploration it has not

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.630 
changed in over 100 million years
this<00:02:45.239> means<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.780> relicanth<00:02:46.530> could<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.310> have

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
this means that relicanth could not have

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.910 
this means that relicanth could not have
been<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.970> predecessor<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.690> Magikarp<00:02:49.380> unless

been the predecessor to Magikarp unless

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
been the predecessor to Magikarp unless
the<00:02:50.160> Pokedex<00:02:50.700> meant<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.239> relicanth<00:02:51.780> itself

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
the Pokedex meant that relicanth itself

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.740 
the Pokedex meant that relicanth itself
hasn't<00:02:53.040> changed<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> had<00:02:54.299> become
