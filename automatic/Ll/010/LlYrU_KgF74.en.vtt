00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.420 

okay<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.580> want<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> show<00:00:06.090> you<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.510> we<00:00:06.569> can

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay so I want to show you how we can

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.760 
okay so I want to show you how we can
play<00:00:08.430> a<00:00:08.460> walking<00:00:08.969> bass<00:00:09.150> line<00:00:09.450> over<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> tune

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
play a walking bass line over a tune

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.619 
play a walking bass line over a tune
that's<00:00:10.799> written<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.700> minor<00:00:12.119> key<00:00:12.799> using<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
that's written in a minor key using the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.840 
that's written in a minor key using the
initial<00:00:15.629> walking<00:00:16.289> bass<00:00:16.560> notes<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.610> used

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
initial walking bass notes that we used

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.760 
initial walking bass notes that we used
back<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> major<00:00:18.630> key<00:00:18.779> those<00:00:19.380> notes<00:00:19.619> if

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
back in the major key those notes if

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.770 
back in the major key those notes if
you'll<00:00:19.920> remember<00:00:20.100> where<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.700> roots<00:00:20.940> the

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
you'll remember where the roots the

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.430 
you'll remember where the roots the
fifth<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:23.070> octave<00:00:23.610> and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.390> dominant<00:00:24.990> seven

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
fifth the octave and the dominant seven

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.210 
fifth the octave and the dominant seven
okay

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
okay

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.540 
okay
of<00:00:26.280> the<00:00:26.700> scale<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.200> with<00:00:28.620> minor<00:00:29.040> or

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of the scale if we do that with minor or

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.380 
of the scale if we do that with minor or
major<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.810> works<00:00:31.200> so<00:00:32.009> we'll<00:00:33.000> show<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> how

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
major it works so we'll show you how

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.729 
major it works so we'll show you how
this<00:00:33.510> works<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> particular

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this works and for this particular

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
this works and for this particular
example<00:00:35.129> we're<00:00:35.699> gonna<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.269> key<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.570> C

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
example we're gonna be in the key of C

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
example we're gonna be in the key of C
so<00:00:37.850> we've<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.059> C<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.780> root<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:41.269> when<00:00:42.269> we

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so we've got C as our root and when we

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
so we've got C as our root and when we
go<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.399> F<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:45.179> the<00:00:45.390> four<00:00:45.749> chord<00:00:46.140> rather

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
go to the F that's the four chord rather

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.149 
go to the F that's the four chord rather
than<00:00:47.069> going<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:48.089> to<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> F<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.679> going<00:00:50.069> to

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
than going up to this F I'm going to

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.630 
than going up to this F I'm going to
shift<00:00:50.429> down<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.350> F<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.890> we've<00:00:53.190> discussed

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
shift down to this F as we've discussed

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.629 
shift down to this F as we've discussed
before<00:00:53.870> see<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:54.989> those<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.469> F's<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:56.069> octaves

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
before see how those two F's are octaves

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:02.750 
before see how those two F's are octaves
so<00:00:57.829> C<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.639> our<00:00:59.850> root<00:01:00.089> for<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> C<00:01:00.600> chord<00:01:00.920> F<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so C is our root for the C chord F is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.219 
so C is our root for the C chord F is
our<00:01:03.239> root<00:01:03.479> for<00:01:03.749> the<00:01:03.870> F<00:01:04.110> chord<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:06.229> eventually

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
our root for the F chord and eventually

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
our root for the F chord and eventually
we'll<00:01:07.440> have<00:01:07.470> an<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.850> flat<00:01:09.500> seven<00:01:10.500> chord<00:01:11.090> which

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
we'll have an a flat seven chord which

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.850 
we'll have an a flat seven chord which
is<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.270> major<00:01:12.750> chord<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.590> flat<00:01:13.670> major<00:01:14.670> seven<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
is a major chord a flat major seven and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.450 
is a major chord a flat major seven and
a<00:01:16.880> g7<00:01:18.260> for<00:01:19.260> those<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.770> still<00:01:19.980> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> use

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
a g7 for those we're still going to use

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.360 
a g7 for those we're still going to use
root<00:01:21.200> v<00:01:22.280> octave<00:01:23.420> dominant<00:01:24.420> seventh<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.370> root

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
root v octave dominant seventh and root

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.210 
root v octave dominant seventh and root
v<00:01:26.790> octave<00:01:27.510> dominant<00:01:28.260> seventh<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:29.040> it'll

v octave dominant seventh and it'll

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.760 
v octave dominant seventh and it'll
sound<00:01:29.400> great<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.270> won't<00:01:30.570> matter<00:01:30.930> whether

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
sound great and it won't matter whether

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.140 
sound great and it won't matter whether
they're<00:01:32.160> major<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.270> minor<00:01:34.280> chords<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.940> let<00:01:36.060> me

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
they're major or minor chords so let me

00:01:36.150 --> 00:02:15.130 
they're major or minor chords so let me
show<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.330> how<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.690> works

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.260 

top<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.190> tip

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:50.180 

f

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.100 

so<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.879> can<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.629> can<00:02:52.810> incorporate

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
so as you can see we can incorporate

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.910 
so as you can see we can incorporate
that<00:02:53.709> very<00:02:54.549> basic<00:02:55.090> walking<00:02:55.420> bass<00:02:55.780> line<00:02:56.079> into

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
that very basic walking bass line into

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.199 
that very basic walking bass line into
both<00:02:57.190> major<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.209> minor<00:02:58.920> chord<00:02:59.920> changes<00:03:00.400> give

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
both major and minor chord changes give

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.349 
both major and minor chord changes give
it<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.390> try<00:03:01.599> on<00:03:01.629> mr.<00:03:02.170> PC<00:03:02.620> or<00:03:02.940> try<00:03:03.940> another<00:03:04.150> tune

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
it a try on mr. PC or try another tune

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.539 
it a try on mr. PC or try another tune
that's<00:03:04.629> got<00:03:04.810> minor<00:03:05.319> tonality<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.280> you'll<00:03:06.400> see

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
that's got minor tonality and you'll see

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.940 
that's got minor tonality and you'll see
how<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.700> works<00:03:06.970> really<00:03:07.209> easily<00:03:07.409> give<00:03:08.409> it<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.560> try

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
how it works really easily give it a try

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.340 
how it works really easily give it a try
good<00:03:09.190> luck
