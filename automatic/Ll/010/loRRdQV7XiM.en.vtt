 Evenings nights wherever it is that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320

 nothing let's see our minecraft and 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.720
 let's update it completely for 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 let them see that I am using the version 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 of 1.4 points 6 and well I hope that you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.970
 like the tutorial the truth does not cause 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.509
 tumors in many tutorials 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.309
 but good is a tutorial that the truth 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.550
 you look for a lot and very few people are 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.800
 they know how to explain it and I will teach them 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.860
 two forms the manual form and the way 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.460
 automatic to say how they are going to see 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 like this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.790
 Here the description will leave you the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.739
 Mace forces greens immediately fire 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.050
 because right now the mime page 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 festive where it is normally downloaded 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 have many problems for example I 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.340
 to download it I'm almost two hours 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.840
 trying to download download sorry 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.790
 this since it is very the guided is very 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.370
 when a freak takes issue directly 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.980
 I repeat this much, I was almost two hours 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.240
 and lie to them to download it but hey 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.430
 as you like or leave the link 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.160
 from maikel folch to download it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.440
 if they are going to install it manually and then 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.900
 let this be mine craft this point 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.369
 minecraft point ya the 7 in the force 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.979
 installed although good as well says 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.240
 minecraft 1.4 points 6 or that what 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.330
 we are going to do is to open 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.270
 downloaded the maker universal forge what 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.070
 we will open and we will go we will 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.330
 press windows r 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.790
 or let's write percent app data 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 percent is open the folder of 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.890
 training given this we will go to a point 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.820
 Minecraft 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.830
 bean and is already minecraft point 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.850
 minecraft I have it so that it opens 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.100
 with winrar then I come winrar 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.060
 let's repeat it does not work and well we have 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.009
 here we have the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 here we have the microphone I say but the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.420
 universal forum and here we have the point 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.090
 that yesterday then we will do is 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.920
 bring all this with control ao 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 simply 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.860
 we started marking we marked everything 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860
 micro 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.420
 so they control for easier and we're going 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.970
 to drag our minecraft folder 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.700
 point yesterday we wait for them to move to 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.160
 to accept 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.980
 very important eye we can give you the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.709
 edge here in our folder in each 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.260
 point and forgiveness in the file we're going to 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.720
 delete this folder we give a click above 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.550
 and we give it away because it happens if not the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.800
 we eliminate a micro will be created 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 automatically then now I'm going to 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.920
 to show 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:54.180
 this is going to take so long because internet 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.620
 because it is fast but if it takes them not 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.520
 worry because they are left with those 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.100
 updates 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 and well this here we already see that it has 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.200
 says three loaded motorcycles we have active 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.340
 which is the leading fort and choose park 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.260
 then this one is ready 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.200
 ok that 's the manual way in case 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.940
 that you fuck them they can not 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.379
 enter the only thing we're going to do 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.379
 is to update our minecraft 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.890
 I repeat in case that we are charged and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.240
 that you can not install what you 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.360
 they are going to do is to update their 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.260
 microsoft so it's clean 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.260
 but wait for me here 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.230
 right now it's good 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.820
 while we are going to look for the mode but not 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.820
 I was watching that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:03.410
 I have to teach them how to install an engine 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.980
 since I really woods then this 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.980
 Let's see 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.390
 or as a beloved tarzan 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.680
 for those who arrive installed is not 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.060
 necessary to keep seeing this is for 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.420
 those who can not install it 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.660
 have problems this thanks for watching the 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.660
 video 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.250
 well this is for those who charge and 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.610
 can not really install it then 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.680
 as I do not have to do is open 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.560
 again we are not going to the folder of 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.900
 reining bin and we're going to erase our 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.270
 minecraft that we have here and we're going to 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.129
 put the one that I would leave them with fort that 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.099
 it would be this we put it 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.099
 and now we open the minecraft again 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.220
 the fork installed that is for those 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.039
 that really charged them have not 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.500
 understood how to do it 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.990
 mayer for this point maker and now 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.580
 install a mode we go through 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.520
 the folder where our 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.169
 monitor let's swim mods folder and 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.930
 we pull for example this way that 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.460
 call time world 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.630
 hopefully not think it I just 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.630
 to download a new proven 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.930
 and between normal matter 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.460
 and as you can see, it has already taken a lot of 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.889
 it seems 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.620
 how can we check if this mode 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.910
 it serves good timber easily 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.910
 we just go to this 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.010
 and anybody but here I have this but 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.010
 if you guide her but then this one 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.370
 but with a 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.720
 with a chiva that served me and that's 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.190
 same for all modes simply 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.030
 downloading and put the folder 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.130
 mods and good and after this goes to 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.130
 leave now that we have installed the 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.170
 forum we are going to install the opt in fine and 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.910
 Then he takes items because I tell them 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.590
 this because if they do not follow that order the 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.880
