 grand theft auto online which 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.030
 It is proposed, of course, to this basic 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.130
 the game and also you get free 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
 digital copy grand theft auto san 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 andreas for pc 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.689
 this is very good because down very 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 many mods 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.850
 so many servers I mean the game is still 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.360
 Since popular so I think she you not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.500
 lying around somewhere on a shelf where 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 will be covered with dust 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.509
 what else can you say 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.369
 In principle, everything will be the same as in 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.560
 Other versions of this are English voice acting and 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.180
 Russian interface, but why subtitles 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.150
 there is no 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 I think in the future when the game will be released 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.590
 Still, the subtitles will also appear 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.300
 system requirements appeared this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.220
 apparently already final not 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.110
 final unknown no no 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.420
 finally and here in time the system 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.760
 The requirements of this game may change in 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.810
 the result la la la la la in some changes 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.660
 but here are the minimum requirements that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.200
 There is at the moment this and nvidia 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:28.890
 9800gt 4gb ram and dual core processor 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.120
 65 gigabytes of free space 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.980
 100% direct compatible 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.840
 tenth so on weak 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.020
 video cards that do not support already 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.540
 With 10 of course you can not play and now 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.610
 recommended system requirements 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.680
 also nothing special and 5 8 gb ram 660 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.050
 Well, I thought boutiques are harder. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 somehow so who wants can already probably 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.420

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.840
