really wish they would nerf it so I can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
really wish they would nerf it so I can
go<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> using<00:01:50.490> my<00:01:50.729> shotty<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
go back to using my shotty because I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
go back to using my shotty because I
just<00:01:51.540> love<00:01:51.750> using<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.409> gun<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.790> now<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
just love using that gun but right now I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.270 
just love using that gun but right now I
guess<00:01:54.470> stuck<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.680> using<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> closer

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
guess stuck with using the closer

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.069 
guess stuck with using the closer
interesting<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.090> might<00:01:57.540> break<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
interesting on I might break out the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.219 
interesting on I might break out the
shoddy<00:01:58.320> once<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> while<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.780> for<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.930> I'm

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
shoddy once in a while but for now I'm

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.410 
shoddy once in a while but for now I'm
going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.590> using<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> machine<00:02:02.430> gun<00:02:02.610> closer

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to be using the machine gun closer

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
going to be using the machine gun closer
engine<00:02:04.250> it's<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> good<00:02:05.549> combination<00:02:05.790> frenzy

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
engine it's a good combination frenzy

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
engine it's a good combination frenzy
fire<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.320> long-range<00:02:07.590> machine<00:02:08.190> gun<00:02:08.340> in

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
fire with my long-range machine gun in

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.319 
fire with my long-range machine gun in
my<00:02:08.580> close<00:02:08.819> range

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.569 

for<00:02:15.329> build<00:02:15.689> in<00:02:16.049> this<00:02:16.230> game<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.829> really<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
for build in this game I really have

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.059 
for build in this game I really have
wait<00:02:18.540> no<00:02:18.750> yeah<00:02:19.140> no<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.349> don't<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.650> frenzied

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
wait no yeah no I don't have frenzied

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.440 
wait no yeah no I don't have frenzied
fire<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.549> should<00:02:20.819> be<00:02:20.970> able<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.269> guess<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
fire so I should be able to guess that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
fire so I should be able to guess that
uh<00:02:21.689> i<00:02:22.430> think<00:02:23.430> i<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:24.560> full<00:02:25.560> shield<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:28.790> let's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
uh i think i have full shield and let's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.280 
uh i think i have full shield and let's
see<00:02:29.970> how<00:02:30.090> long<00:02:30.269> does<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.599> sprint<00:02:30.959> look<00:02:31.140> like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
see how long does this sprint look like

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
see how long does this sprint look like
is<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:32.370> looks<00:02:32.519> like<00:02:32.700> full<00:02:32.970> shield<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.510> sprint

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
is it looks like full shield and sprint

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.399 
is it looks like full shield and sprint
with<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.890> 102<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:35.970> tag<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:37.170> one

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
with one and 102 and tag and then one

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.130 
with one and 102 and tag and then one
and<00:02:37.620> ie<00:02:37.709> grenade<00:02:38.599> pretty<00:02:39.599> sure<00:02:39.810> that's<00:02:39.989> what

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
and ie grenade pretty sure that's what

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.970 
and ie grenade pretty sure that's what
it<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.349> i'm<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.829> sure<00:02:41.040> i<00:02:42.620> was<00:02:43.620> thinking<00:02:43.890> about

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
it is i'm not sure i was thinking about

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490 
it is i'm not sure i was thinking about
making<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.549> Gunner's<00:02:44.909> build<00:02:45.239> guide<00:02:45.569> but<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.470> be

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
making a Gunner's build guide but to be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.699 
making a Gunner's build guide but to be
honest<00:02:47.040> there's<00:02:47.760> plenty<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.989> builds<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.590> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
honest there's plenty of builds that you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.680 
honest there's plenty of builds that you
can<00:02:49.889> use<00:02:50.159> there's<00:02:50.459> no<00:02:50.639> definite<00:02:51.239> build<00:02:51.510> that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
can use there's no definite build that

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.020 
can use there's no definite build that
you<00:02:51.840> need<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.129> only<00:02:53.430> thing<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.819> could<00:02:54.000> be

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you need to the only thing that could be

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.020 
you need to the only thing that could be
really<00:02:54.389> stupid<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.049> like<00:02:55.260> pure<00:02:56.220> ie<00:02:56.459> grenade

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
really stupid is like pure ie grenade

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.970 
really stupid is like pure ie grenade
level<00:02:57.720> 5<00:02:59.780> any<00:03:00.780> other<00:03:01.079> bills<00:03:01.379> would<00:03:01.650> probably

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
level 5 any other bills would probably

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.339 
level 5 any other bills would probably
be<00:03:02.099> good<00:03:02.129> for<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.939> I<00:03:03.269> ended<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.959> deciding

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
be good for you so I ended up deciding

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.960 
be good for you so I ended up deciding
not<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.680> do<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:08.989> this<00:03:09.989> game<00:03:10.290> was<00:03:10.639> pretty<00:03:11.639> good

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
not to do it this game was pretty good

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.849 
not to do it this game was pretty good
teamwork<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.569> had<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:12.720> lot<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> soldiers<00:03:13.290> I

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
teamwork we had a lot of soldiers I

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.110 
teamwork we had a lot of soldiers I
think<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.000> perfect<00:03:15.209> team<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:17.120> mostly

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
think like the perfect team is a mostly

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.509 
think like the perfect team is a mostly
soldiers<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.169> few<00:03:19.650> Gunners<00:03:19.949> to<00:03:20.099> carry<00:03:20.370> you

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
soldiers with a few Gunners to carry you

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.610 
soldiers with a few Gunners to carry you
may<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.940> few<00:03:21.449> commandos<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.109> counter<00:03:22.440> their

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
may be a few commandos to counter their

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.759 
may be a few commandos to counter their
commandos<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.079> where<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.379> tough<00:03:28.440> as

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
commandos this is where it's tough as

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.170 
commandos this is where it's tough as
gunner<00:03:29.069> especially<00:03:29.819> if<00:03:29.879> you're<00:03:30.030> by

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
gunner especially if you're by

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.849 
gunner especially if you're by
yourselves<00:03:30.599> when<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.079> gets<00:03:31.230> too<00:03:31.349> long<00:03:31.560> range

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
yourselves when it gets too long range

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.589 
yourselves when it gets too long range
fights<00:03:32.220> because<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.639> can't<00:03:32.879> take<00:03:33.359> some

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
fights because you can't take some

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.629 
fights because you can't take some
damage<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.019> heal<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.530> you're<00:03:35.069> not<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:35.430> any

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
damage and heal if you're not with any

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.330 
damage and heal if you're not with any
soldiers<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:37.409> always<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.919> get<00:03:38.010> close

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
soldiers so you always have to get close

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.089 
soldiers so you always have to get close
range<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.299> frenzied<00:03:39.690> fire<00:03:40.099> could

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
range if you have frenzied fire could

00:03:41.099 --> 00:04:02.590 
range if you have frenzied fire could
use<00:03:41.280> that

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.660 

you<00:04:03.600> always<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.140> be<00:04:04.260> aware<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:05.520> your

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
you always have to be aware of what your

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.400 
you always have to be aware of what your
teammates<00:04:06.120> are<00:04:06.300> doing<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.840> what<00:04:06.990> else<00:04:07.200> is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
teammates are doing and what else is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.170 
teammates are doing and what else is
going<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.740> like<00:04:08.040> right<00:04:08.220> now<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> realize<00:04:08.910> these

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
going on like right now I realize these

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.060 
going on like right now I realize these
two<00:04:09.420> soldiers<00:04:09.720> are<00:04:10.110> kind<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.380> camping<00:04:10.860> and

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
two soldiers are kind of camping and

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.640 
two soldiers are kind of camping and
staying<00:04:11.310> around<00:04:11.460> with<00:04:11.820> me<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.300> i<00:04:12.540> guess<00:04:13.350> i<00:04:13.500> got

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
staying around with me so i guess i got

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.950 
staying around with me so i guess i got
up<00:04:13.800> camp<00:04:14.190> with<00:04:14.430> them<00:04:14.610> because<00:04:15.600> i<00:04:15.750> don't<00:04:15.930> want

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
up camp with them because i don't want

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.510 
up camp with them because i don't want
to<00:04:16.140> split<00:04:16.350> apart<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.770> team<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.280> maybe

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
to split apart the team and have maybe

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.940 
to split apart the team and have maybe
one<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:17.850> them<00:04:18.000> follow<00:04:18.300> me<00:04:18.480> then<00:04:19.410> i<00:04:19.530> realized

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
one of them follow me then i realized

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.040 
one of them follow me then i realized
looks<00:04:20.760> like<00:04:20.910> we're<00:04:21.090> starting<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.510> charge<00:04:21.750> up

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
looks like we're starting to charge up

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.920 
looks like we're starting to charge up
over<00:04:22.380> here<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> right<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.780> go<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
over here on the right so I go in to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:39.980 
over here on the right so I go in to
join<00:04:25.260> them<00:04:36.710> if<00:04:38.060> you're<00:04:39.060> with<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.450> group<00:04:39.870> of

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
join them if you're with the group of

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.450 
join them if you're with the group of
soldiers<00:04:40.170> don't<00:04:40.530> be<00:04:40.710> afraid<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.040> ask<00:04:41.160> for

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
soldiers don't be afraid to ask for

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.160
