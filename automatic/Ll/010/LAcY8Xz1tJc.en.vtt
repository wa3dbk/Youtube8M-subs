00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.539 
this would be treated with a bio
material<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:51.170> resist<00:02:52.180> bugs<00:02:53.380> bugs<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.680> bales

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
material to resist bugs bugs and bales

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.559 
material to resist bugs bugs and bales
are<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.150> bad<00:02:56.780> combination<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
are a bad combination this is what the

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.390 
are a bad combination this is what the
work<00:02:59.720> looked<00:03:00.290> like<00:03:00.500> towards<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.340> end<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.700> the
