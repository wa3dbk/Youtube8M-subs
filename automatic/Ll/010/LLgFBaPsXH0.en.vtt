where<00:03:56.280> people<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.910> up<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.269> camp<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:58.230> they<00:03:58.380> are

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
where people go up in camp but they are

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.009 
where people go up in camp but they are
quite<00:03:58.950> obvious<00:03:59.549> you<00:04:00.060> know<00:04:00.209> certain<00:04:00.660> windows

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
quite obvious you know certain windows

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.990 
quite obvious you know certain windows
that<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.530> know<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.010> look<00:04:02.280> at<00:04:02.489> if<00:04:02.790> there's

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that you know to look at if there's

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.720 
that you know to look at if there's
campers<00:04:03.600> inside<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.200> them<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.489> flank

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
campers inside of them and you can flank

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.160 
campers inside of them and you can flank
around<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.120> outside<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.750> come<00:04:06.900> up<00:04:07.019> behind

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
around the outside to come up behind

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.580 
around the outside to come up behind
them<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:07.880> good<00:04:08.880> map<00:04:09.090> overall<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.959> think

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
them so good map overall I think

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.770 
them so good map overall I think
sovereign<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.860> just<00:04:13.549> way<00:04:13.790> too<00:04:13.849> random<00:04:14.689> and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
sovereign is just way too random and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.499 
sovereign is just way too random and
crazy<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:16.340> seems<00:04:16.609> like<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.759> spawns<00:04:17.150> people

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
crazy and it seems like it spawns people

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.629 
crazy and it seems like it spawns people
behind<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.229> whole<00:04:18.259> time<00:04:18.590> like<00:04:19.070> three

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
behind you the whole time like three

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.180 
behind you the whole time like three
levels<00:04:20.120> there's<00:04:20.769> underground<00:04:21.769> leurs<00:04:21.949> up

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
levels there's underground leurs up

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.900 
levels there's underground leurs up
above<00:04:22.490> then<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> main<00:04:23.479> floor<00:04:23.840> area<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.910> just

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
above then the main floor area and just

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.680 
above then the main floor area and just
two<00:04:26.479> random<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.940> like<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.300> always

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
two random I I don't like it I always

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.210 
two random I I don't like it I always
feel<00:04:30.169> like<00:04:30.199> I'm<00:04:30.440> getting<00:04:30.530> shot<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.039> back

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
feel like I'm getting shot in the back

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.749 
feel like I'm getting shot in the back
on<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.550> map<00:04:32.320> overlord<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.680> don't<00:04:34.400> like<00:04:34.460> this

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
on that map overlord I don't like this

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.540 
on that map overlord I don't like this
one<00:04:34.940> either<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.419> think<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:35.870> way<00:04:36.020> too<00:04:36.050> big

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
one either I think it's way too big

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.730 
one either I think it's way too big
especially<00:04:37.550> for<00:04:37.669> 6<00:04:37.940> p-6<00:04:38.360> maybe<00:04:39.199> when<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:39.620> get

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
especially for 6 p-6 maybe when we get

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.450 
especially for 6 p-6 maybe when we get
some<00:04:39.949> 99<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:41.050> xbox<00:04:42.050> one<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:43.009> might<00:04:43.220> play<00:04:43.430> a

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
some 99 in xbox one it might play a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.980 
some 99 in xbox one it might play a
little<00:04:43.639> better<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.300> so<00:04:44.840> big<00:04:45.139> that<00:04:45.169> it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
little better but it's so big that it's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.120 
little better but it's so big that it's
most<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.110> time<00:04:48.260> you're<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.470> spent<00:04:48.830> running

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
most the time you're just spent running

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.750 
most the time you're just spent running
around<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.669> map<00:04:49.850> trying<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.240> find<00:04:50.449> Bianca<00:04:51.020> and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
around the map trying to find Bianca and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.520 
around the map trying to find Bianca and
and<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.880> camping<00:04:53.330> spots<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:53.990> this<00:04:54.139> are<00:04:54.380> really

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
and the camping spots on this are really

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.850 
and the camping spots on this are really
harder<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.490> flank<00:04:55.870> because<00:04:56.870> they<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.560> such

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
harder to flank because they have such

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.490 
harder to flank because they have such
wide<00:04:58.520> area<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.510> it's<00:04:59.750> hard<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.139> flank<00:05:00.350> around

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
wide area that it's hard to flank around

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.870 
wide area that it's hard to flank around
them<00:05:00.830> so<00:05:01.900> don't<00:05:02.900> really<00:05:03.139> care<00:05:03.289> for<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.590> one

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
them so don't really care for that one

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.980 
them so don't really care for that one
stonehaven<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.090> don't<00:05:05.539> know<00:05:05.630> what<00:05:05.810> they're

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
stonehaven I don't know what they're

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.020 
stonehaven I don't know what they're
fucking<00:05:06.500> thinking<00:05:06.830> with<00:05:06.949> this<00:05:07.099> one<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.490> guess

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
fucking thinking with this one I guess

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.490 
fucking thinking with this one I guess
the<00:05:08.210> only<00:05:08.360> people<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.840> would<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.289> one

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the only people that would like this one

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.770 
the only people that would like this one
are<00:05:09.770> snipers<00:05:10.250> it's<00:05:10.789> a<00:05:11.000> great<00:05:11.150> place<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:11.599> go<00:05:11.750> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
are snipers it's a great place to go and

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.659 
are snipers it's a great place to go and
do<00:05:12.020> some<00:05:12.199> quick<00:05:12.530> scopes<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:15.370> other<00:05:16.370> than<00:05:16.580> that

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
do some quick scopes but other than that

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.610 
do some quick scopes but other than that
I<00:05:17.120> think<00:05:17.660> it's<00:05:17.780> crappy<00:05:19.389> chasm<00:05:20.389> is<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.690> mixed<00:05:21.440> up

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
I think it's crappy chasm is a mixed up

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.850 
I think it's crappy chasm is a mixed up
pile<00:05:22.250> of<00:05:22.460> shit<00:05:22.729> another<00:05:23.720> totally<00:05:24.380> random

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
pile of shit another totally random

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.580 
pile of shit another totally random
people<00:05:25.580> are<00:05:25.699> above<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.840> below<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:27.409> like

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
people are above and below you it's like

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.909 
people are above and below you it's like
four<00:05:28.310> levels<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.849> craziness<00:05:29.720> don't<00:05:30.560> care<00:05:30.740> for

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
four levels of craziness don't care for

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.909 
four levels of craziness don't care for
that<00:05:30.949> one<00:05:31.570> flooded<00:05:32.570> don't<00:05:33.349> really<00:05:33.590> care<00:05:33.770> for

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
that one flooded don't really care for

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.680 
that one flooded don't really care for
that<00:05:33.949> one<00:05:34.159> for<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.430> same<00:05:34.610> randomness<00:05:35.030> factor

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
that one for the same randomness factor

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.570 
that one for the same randomness factor
and<00:05:35.990> always<00:05:36.260> there's<00:05:36.590> like<00:05:36.740> 50<00:05:37.460> different

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
and always there's like 50 different

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
and always there's like 50 different
places<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.240> people<00:05:38.360> could<00:05:38.630> shoot<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:38.900> from

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
places that people could shoot you from

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.589 
places that people could shoot you from
and<00:05:39.860> it's<00:05:40.039> hard<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.340> navigate<00:05:40.460> around<00:05:40.760> the<00:05:41.090> map

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
and it's hard to navigate around the map

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.080 
and it's hard to navigate around the map
without<00:05:41.810> getting<00:05:42.229> shot<00:05:42.260> in<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.590> back<00:05:43.090> strike

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090

without getting shot in the back strike
zone<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.659> probably<00:05:45.080> my<00:05:45.260> favorite<00:05:45.289> map<00:05:45.979> in<00:05:46.159> the

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
zone is probably my favorite map in the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.089 
zone is probably my favorite map in the
game<00:05:46.430> it's<00:05:47.150> very<00:05:47.479> predictable<00:05:48.320> it's<00:05:48.590> small

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
game it's very predictable it's small

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.450 
game it's very predictable it's small
it's<00:05:49.490> fast-paced<00:05:50.000> and<00:05:50.570> it's<00:05:51.020> awesome<00:05:51.470> and

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
it's fast-paced and it's awesome and

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.110 
it's fast-paced and it's awesome and
then<00:05:52.849> the<00:05:52.940> last<00:05:52.970> one<00:05:53.389> is<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.750> DLC<00:05:54.740> map<00:05:55.520> free

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
then the last one is the DLC map free

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.060 
then the last one is the DLC map free
fall<00:05:56.449> which<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.169> can<00:05:57.349> download<00:05:57.530> with<00:05:57.979> the

very carefully on this map but overall

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.029 
very carefully on this map but overall
it's<00:06:21.270> it's<00:06:21.629> fast<00:06:21.990> paced<00:06:22.110> people<00:06:22.770> will

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
it's it's fast paced people will

it's it's fast paced people will
generally<00:06:23.639> run<00:06:23.849> around<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:25.190> it's<00:06:26.190> fun<00:06:26.490> that's

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
that's really what makes a good map to

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.309 
that's really what makes a good map to
me<00:06:29.340> his<00:06:29.639> maps<00:06:29.940> that<00:06:30.180> will<00:06:30.330> promote<00:06:30.659> people<00:06:31.020> to
